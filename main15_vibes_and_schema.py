ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
1. Examine the title, description, and tags carefully for clues about the workout's emotional quality and experience.
2. Look for indicators of intensity, duration, music style, coaching approach, and exercise types.
3. Consider the channel's focus and typical content style.
4. User comments may provide additional clues about the emotional experience of the workout.
5. When confidence is low for a vibe, mark it appropriately.
6. For each workout, identify 1-3 most suitable vibes that match the workout, with a score value (0-1) for each.
7. Provide a detailed explanation of why you assigned specific vibes, citing evidence from the metadata.

VIBES EXPLANATION GUIDELINES:
When writing the 'vibesExplanation' field, provide a detailed and structured analysis that:
1. Explains why each selected vibe was chosen, with specific evidence from the metadata
2. Cites specific words, phrases, or terms from the title, description, or other metadata
3. Justifies the score assigned to each vibe
4. Mentions any uncertainty or ambiguity in the classification
5. Explains why other potential vibes were excluded (if relevant)
6. Keep explanations concise but comprehensive (typically 100-200 words)

CONFIDENCE LEVELS EXPLANATION:
- 0.8-1.0: Very high confidence - Strong explicit indicators in title, description, or visuals
- 0.6-0.79: High confidence - Clear indicators or strong implicit evidence
- 0.4-0.59: Moderate confidence - Some indicators or reasonable inference from context
- 0.2-0.39: Low confidence - Minimal indicators or educated guess
- 0-0.19: Very low confidence - Extremely limited evidence, mostly guesswork

SCORE VALUES EXPLANATION:
- 0.8-1.0: Extremely strong match, perfect embodiment of the vibe
