  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Energy Walking Playlist' is designed to support walking through a collection of upbeat and rhythmic tracks. The playlist title and description ('Upbeat tunes to walk to,' 'energetic walking playlist') clearly indicate a focus on maintaining an energetic tempo suitable for an invigorating walking experience. The inclusion of high-energy tracks like Cher's 'Strong Enough' (disco genre with a fast BPM and high danceability), and classic rock and glam rock tracks such as Bowie\u2019s 'Rebel Rebel,' suggests an intent to keep listeners engaged and motivated, promoting a rhythmic flow.\n\nThe consistent medium to high BPM across tracks ('Can't Keep It In,' 'Rebel Rebel') and a positive, rhythmic focus suggest a strong 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.75). However, the presence of high-energy and empowering songs like 'Strong Enough' and other intense tracks suggests a secondary 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit (score: 0.7), which provides motivational boosts within the walk. The playlist lacks the structured or intensely planned design typical of a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit and does not include the slow tempos and gentle tones of a 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' experience, thus excluding them."
