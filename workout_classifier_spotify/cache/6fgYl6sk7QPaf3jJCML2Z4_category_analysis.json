  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'Best Christian Workout Mix 2025' is explicitly designed as a motivational and energetic playlist suitable for various types of workouts, as mentioned in the description with terms such as 'running,' 'lifting,' and 'CrossFit.' The focus on running and the association with high-energy, uplifting Christian music is indicative of supporting high-intensity activities like running. This inference is further strengthened by the query used: 'running playlist.'\n\nThe playlist's extensive list of tracks, featuring upbeat tempos, positive sentiments, and high danceability levels, supports sustained and rhythmic cardiovascular activities, making it highly suited for running both outdoor and indoor (treadmill). The presence of numerous tracks with BPMs around 120-130 indicates alignment with the pacing required for running at moderate to high intensities.\n\nThe selection of tracks with high energy and danceability further supports its utility for treadmill use, which often benefits from motivating music to mirror the steady cadence of treadmill exercise. However, the explicit mention of 'running' in metadata leads to a higher confidence score for the 'Running' category."
