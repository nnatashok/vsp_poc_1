  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist title 'Chill Walking Vibes' explicitly indicates it is designed for walking, suggesting a moderate intensity suited for walking workouts. The user query 'chill walking playlist' strongly aligns with the Walking category, indicating high confidence in this classification. The description 'Playlist transferred with SongShift' does not provide further insight, but the overall theme and selection of tracks, with a focus on moderately paced indie and alternative rock tracks, make it ideal for walking. The track metadata shows medium energy and danceability, suitable for leisurely or brisk walking rather than running. The tracks' medium tempo and introspective mood suggest that they are more suited to walking, especially with moderate beats per minute that match a walking pace. There is no indication that this playlist is designed for running or treadmill-specific workouts, excluding those categories."
