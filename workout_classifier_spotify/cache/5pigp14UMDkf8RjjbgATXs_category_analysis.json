  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'KEEP IT FIT' is strongly geared towards running workouts, as indicated by the title and description mentioning 'Running' and a focus on 'inspirational' music, which is ideal for sustaining motivation during such workouts. \n\nThe presence of energetic tracks like 'Roll the Bass' by Major Lazer with high energy and danceability scores and a fast-paced BPM suggests a playlist conducive to running, reflecting a dynamic and motivational atmosphere. The track-list features many high-energy hip-hop and electronic music tracks, which are typically used to maintain a steady and vigorous pace, further supporting the Running category.\n\nThe playlist is also somewhat suitable for Treadmill workouts given its mention of 'gym' in the description, implying that it can be used for both indoor (treadmill) and outdoor settings. However, the explicit focus on running limits the suitability to treadmill workouts alone, thus warranting a lower score for this category.\n\nThe Walking category was not selected as most tracks have high energy levels and tempos that are generally not suitable for the moderate pace characteristic of walking workouts."
