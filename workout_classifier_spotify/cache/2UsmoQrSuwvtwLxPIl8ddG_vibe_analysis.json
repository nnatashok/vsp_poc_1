  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist 'Energy Walking Playlist' is described as containing 'upbeat tunes to walk to,' with a focus on energetic walking. The track selection features a variety of classic and rock-oriented songs, emphasizing steady rhythms and positive, engaging vibes. Most tracks, such as 'Rebel Rebel' by David Bowie and 'Strong Enough' by Cher, embody a mix of rock and disco with high energy and danceability, suitable for creating a fun and flowing walking experience.\n\nThe chosen vibe, 'The Groove Session,' fits well due to the playlist's emphasis on fun, expressive themes typical of classic hits and their rhythmic beat, supporting a feel-good pace. Songs like 'Walk Of Life' by Dire Straits further underscore this with their strong beat and upbeat themes, supporting steady and enjoyable walking.\n\n'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' was also considered due to the beat-driven nature of many songs, emphasizing rhythm and energetic flow. However, as the description and tracklist reflect a more light-hearted and expressive walking session rather than pure power, 'The Groove Session' was prioritized.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 0.75 as there's a strong indication from both the playlist description and the musical characteristics, though not every track fits perfectly, reducing certainty slightly."
