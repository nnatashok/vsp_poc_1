  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist title 'The running vibes you need' and the query 'running inspiration playlist' strongly align with outdoor or indoor running, justifying the Running category with very high confidence (score: 1). This is also supported by the energetic and high-tempo tracks typical for running, such as 'Black Skinhead' by Kanye West (BPM 130) and 'Dog Days Are Over' by Florence + The Machine (BPM 150).\n\nThe Treadmill category is assigned a high score (0.7) because the playlist can support treadmill workouts with its consistent high energy tracks and vibrant rhythms, suitable for both running and walking workouts on a treadmill. The presence of house and electronic tracks like 'Prada' by cass\u00f6 and 'Baxter (these are my friends)' by Fred again.. further supports this category.\n\nThe Walking category is not strongly supported, given the playlist's focus on high-energy tracks with fast-paced beats that exceed typical walking tempos. Therefore, it is excluded in favor of categories more suited to the playlist's energy and intensity levels."
