  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist '30 MINUTE INSPIRED & STRONG WALK' conveys a vibe that combines inspiration and creativity, aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave' and 'The Mindful Walk'. The playlist is designed for a 30-minute session to open up neuro pathways and promote a feeling of strength and inspiration, suggesting an uplifting, feel-good quality typical of 'The Endorphin Wave'. The tracklist includes upbeat songs like 'Runaway (U & I)' by Galantis and 'Human (feat. Echoes)' by John Summit, which are energetic and can build momentum during a walk, aligning with the 'Endorphin Wave' mindset. Additionally, the reflective and transformative focus described in the metadata implies a mindfulness component, making 'The Mindful Walk' another appropriate vibe, although somewhat less prominent given the energetic style. The use of ambient tracks such as 'levitation' and conceptually reflective songs like ODESZA's remix further support this reflection. The chosen vibes are distinct but complement the playlist's goal to inspire and empower, with attention to both creativity and movement consistency. 'The Rhythm Powerhouse' was considered but the reflective and creative elements outweighed its rhythmic focus."
