  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Steven's Walking Music' is designed for chill and long walks, strongly suggesting a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. Many tracks, such as 'Spirit of Life' by Blackmill, 'Soon It Will Be Cold Enough to Build Fires' by Emancipator, and 'Enjoy the Flight' by Just Chillax, are genres like Chillstep, Downtempo, and Chillhop, which align with a meditative and rhythmic walking experience. The medium energy and danceability further support a smooth, continuous motion, giving this spirit a score of 0.7.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is complemented by 'Soothing & Restorative', reflected in the playlist's 'chill for long walks' description and instrumental tracks that emphasize relaxation and emotional reset, scoring 0.65 here due to the calming feel of the music.\n\nThere is a 'Outdoor & Adventure' suggestion with a score of 0.5. This spirit is bolstered by tracks like 'Rocket Man' by Elton John and the general theme of exploratory, scenic playlists, even though it isn't the primary focus.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the mellow, laid-back nature of most tracks, not fitting high-intensity or regimented workout approaches."
