  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'chill walking playlist' is suggestive of a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to the use of the word 'chill,' which implies a laid-back, relaxed experience suitable for gentle walks. The selection of tracks includes many with lower music energy and mixed to positive lyrics sentiment, such as SZA's 'Ghost in the Machine' and 'After The Storm' by Kali Uchis, further supporting a calming, yet emotionally engaged atmosphere. Due to the notable presence of steady and rhythmic tracks like \"Candy\" by Doja Cat and the general tempo of the playlist, a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also applicable, encouraging a smooth and continuous walking pace. The low stress and moderate tempo of the music allow for a flowing walk. Lastly, there is a mild indication of 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the exploration of emotions and introspective themes in tracks which could enhance a connection to nature during walks; however, this is less pronounced, earning only a slight match with a lower score. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded based on the lack of fast tempo and explicit driving intensity."
