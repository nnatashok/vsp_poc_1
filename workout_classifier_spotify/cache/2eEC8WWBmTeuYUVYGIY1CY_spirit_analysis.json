  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Yoga Instrumental Music 2025 | Chill Soft Vibes' strongly aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, with a score of 0.9. This is evident from the emphasis on smooth, instrumental music for yoga and flow, as noted in the description mentioning 'Calm Vinyasa and Flow Music'. Many tracks, such as those by Jon Hopkins and Sol Rising, feature medium danceability and tempo, suitable for creating a steady, meditative rhythm. The playlist also fits the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a score of 0.8, as the music is ambient and calming, ideal for relaxation and gentle movement. Tracks like 'Repose' and 'Solitude' by Anna B May further this relaxation narrative. Lastly, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is mildly represented with a score of 0.4, since the music's atmospheric and ambient quality can enhance outdoor walking experiences, though it's not the primary focus. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' are not applicable due to the playlist's overall calming and moderate tempo."
