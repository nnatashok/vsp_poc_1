  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'Everything Playlist' encompasses a broad range of activities including 'walking' and 'working out', as mentioned in the description. The use of the query 'chill walking playlist' suggests an emphasis on a low-intensity, possibly leisurely walking experience. The title 'Everything Playlist' indicates a diverse multipurpose playlist, not limited to high-intensity workouts.\n\nThe track list features a variety of popular songs with medium to high energy and danceability, which are suitable for moderate-paced activities like walking. Songs like 'Never Gonna Give You Up' and 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams provide medium energy and upbeat tempos conducive to walking. Additionally, tracks like 'High Hopes' by Panic! At The Disco offer positive and motivational lyrics, aligning with casual or brisk walking sessions rather than intense running.\n\nGiven the broad scope of the playlist and its inclusion of genres and tempos that can suit walking, 'Walking' is the most pertinent category, though the confidence is moderate due to the playlist's general and non-specific nature."
