Songs like 'Dog Days Are Over' by Florence + The Machine and 'Shake It Off' by Taylor Swift feature prominent beats and uplifting themes, fitting well with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe. This vibe is characterized by strong, beat-driven music that supports steady runs and power walks, aligning with the playlist's intent for high-energy running sessions. \n\nAdditionally, tracks like 'I Gotta Feeling' by Black Eyed Peas and 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii contribute to an overall feel-good atmosphere, which corresponds with 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe. This vibe focuses on uplifting music that builds momentum and maintains a positive outlook during long runs, making it a secondary fit. Given the playlist's title suggesting it's meant for running inspiration, alongside the general high energy and popularity of tracks, confidence in this assessment is high but acknowledges some variability in individual track moods."
