  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'Summer Sounds' is primarily described as 'suited for summer activities, whether it's walking on a boardwalk, chilling on a beach, blasting the radio, or partying on a boat.' This provides a summer vibe, implying leisurely activities that pair with moderate exertion levels. The query used, 'chill walking playlist,' explicitly links the playlist to walking, supporting this categorization.\n\nExamining the tracklist reveals many tracks with medium energy and danceability, such as 'Yeasayer_Don't Come Close' and 'Neon Trees_Sleeping With A Friend,' which align well with a walking pace rather than running or intense treadmill sessions. Some EDM tracks like 'CAZZETTE_Sleepless - Radio Edit' have high energy and danceability but still support casual walking in a summer context.\n\nThe focus on summer vibes and chill activities, combined with the query emphasis on walking, supports a primary classification under 'Walking' with a score of 0.7, reflecting a strong presence but not an absolute focus on walking workouts. There are no strong cues indicating running or treadmill workouts, so those categories are not selected."
