  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist title 'Running Motivation 2025 - Techno Running Music' and description strongly suggest a focus on running workouts, supported by high-energy techno music. The use of words like 'Best Running Playlist', 'fuel your runs', and 'techno beats' are direct indicators of suitability for running exercises. The playlist is specifically designed to energize runs with high-energy tracks, making 'Running' the primary and most appropriate classification with high confidence (score: 1). \n\nAdditionally, while there are no explicit mentions of treadmill workouts, the energetic nature of techno music and high number of tracks designed for rhythm and danceability imply potential use for treadmill running or walking. Therefore, the 'Treadmill' category is also relevant, though less emphasized, scoring a 0.6 due to its secondary nature.\n\nThe 'Walking' category is not indicated as the playlist's style suggests a more intense workout environment, as indicated by terms like 'high-energy' and 'fuel your runs', which are not typically associated with walking workouts."
