  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist titled 'Inspirational Running Playlist' is geared towards running, as emphasized by the descriptor 'inspirational' and 'running' query. The tracks, such as 'Titanium' by David Guetta and 'Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)' by Kelly Clarkson, are high-energy with themes of empowerment and resilience, strongly aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe. This vibe captures the uplifting and feel-good aspect of the playlist that is suitable for building momentum during long runs.\n\nThe playlist also fits well with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' due to its beat-driven, fluid nature. Tracks like 'Stronger' by Britney Spears and 'Survivor' by Destiny's Child provide strong, consistent beats that are ideal for steady running rhythms, thus supporting this vibe.\n\nBoth vibes are supported by the empowering, dynamic musical content and the thematic focus on triumph over adversity, as seen in the positive sentiment and high valence across the tracks. The consistent, motivating themes and energetic music elements justify a high confidence level of 0.9 for this classification."
