  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist 'Yoga Instrumental Music 2025 | Chill Soft Vibes' primarily emphasizes relaxation and introspection, as indicated by its description mentioning uses for 'relaxing, study, walking, and chilling,' and its reference to 'Perfect Yoga Beats for Calm Vinyasa and Flow Music.' The tracklist contains titles like 'Inner Peace,' 'Solitude,' and 'Calm Vinyasa,' suggesting themes of serenity and reflection, which align well with 'The Mindful Walk' vibe designed for immersive and reflective walks. The consistent ambient tone across tracks such as 'Inner Peace' and 'Repose' supports this classification.\n\nAdditionally, given the ambient and instrumental nature of the music, coupled with the descriptions of relaxation and yoga practice, 'The Deep Recharge' as a secondary vibe fits well. This vibe focuses on ultra-gentle music ideal for slow, recovery-focused walking sessions.\n\nThe inclusion of elements like ambient and electronic music, as seen in tracks with specific BPMs indicating calming rather than high-energy outputs, further supports these classifications, with high confidence due to explicit descriptors and track characteristics."
