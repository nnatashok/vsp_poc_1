  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist is titled 'chill walking playlist,' explicitly indicating its primary use for walking workouts. The word 'chill' suggests a laid-back, moderate intensity which aligns well with walking workouts. The genre and energy levels of the tracks, like 'Ghost in the Machine' by SZA and 'After The Storm' by Kali Uchis, support a walking pace rather than high-intensity running. Additionally, the song durations and overall playlist length (142 tracks) suggest a collection likely for sustained moderate activity rather than an intense running session. Thus, the 'Walking' category is assigned with high confidence and an extremely strong presence score."
