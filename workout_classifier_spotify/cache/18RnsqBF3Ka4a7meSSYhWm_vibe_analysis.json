This vibe is assigned a high confidence score of 0.9 due to these explicit thematic elements.\n\nAdditionally, the playlist includes various remixes and rhythmically engaging tracks like 'Raising Hell - Steve James Remix' by Kesha and 'Empire State Of Mind' by JAY-Z, which create a steady beat-driven experience that could be suitable for a 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe.
