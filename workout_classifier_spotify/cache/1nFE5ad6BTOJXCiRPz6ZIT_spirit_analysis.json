The consistent tempo across songs like 'Uptown Funk' and 'Can't Hold Us' supports maintaining steady energy levels throughout a run, which corresponds to a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, thus receiving a score of 0.7. Songs with high energy and fast tempos, such as Avicii's 'Hey Brother', denote elements of 'High-Energy & Intense', receiving a score of 0.6 for their ability to push personal limits.
