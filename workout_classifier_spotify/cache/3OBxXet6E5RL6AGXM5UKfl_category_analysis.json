  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist titled 'Steven's Walking Music' and described as 'Great for long walks' is clearly oriented for walking workouts. The description explicitly mentions it as suitable for 'long walks' and 'chill times,' indicating a lower intensity workout matching the Walking category. Furthermore, the music tracks listed include genres such as Chillstep, Downtempo, and Chillhop, which typically feature medium-paced beats suitable for walking rather than running or high-energy treadmill sessions. The use of terms like 'chill' and the presence of instrumental tracks with medium energy and danceability reinforce the suitability for a relaxed, steady-paced activity like walking rather than running or intense treadmill workouts. Therefore, the Walking category receives a high score of 0.9. Other categories like Running and Treadmill are excluded due to the lack of explicit indicators of higher intensity or fast-paced music suitable for those activities, and the overall context promoting a leisurely, moderate experience."
