  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Epic Music for Running' is strongly classified under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit with a score of 0.9. This is derived from explicit phrases in the description such as 'get your adrenaline pumping' and the presence of genres like 'Epic Hybrid Action Metal', which are high in energy and intensity. Tracks such as 'Legendary' with fast BPMs and high energy confirm this classification.\n\nAdditionally, the spirit 'Structured & Disciplined' is identified with a score of 0.7. The playlist is curated by an instrumental composer with a focus on rhythm and musical crescendos, as seen in tracks like 'A Promise to the Stars' and 'Legendary'. These elements support structured running routines where rhythmic consistency aids in pacing.\n\nAlternative spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' are slightly applicable but less dominant due to the more pronounced focus on intense, adrenaline-driven energy rather than meditative rhythms or emotional restoration."
