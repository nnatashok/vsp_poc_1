  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'The running vibes you need' seems to possess a strong 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit based on multiple tracks like 'Black Skinhead' and 'Prada', which have high energy and fast tempos ideal for pushing personal limits or sprints. This aligns with the description of 'running inspiration.' Additionally, the presence of multiple electronic and house tracks with rhythm and danceability suggests a secondary 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, facilitating a steady running pace, promoting a trance-like movement experience. This is reinforced by tracks like 'Dog Days Are Over', which combine brisk tempo with uplifting sentiment. The mix of track tempo and energy levels might also suggest a lesser 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, with tracks by artists like ODESZA offering scenic and open-air-inspired soundscapes. However, given the primary high-energy nature, the emphasis is more on intensity and rhythm rather than purely immersive outdoor exploration. Overall, the playlist confidently fits high-energy, with rhythmic flow traits."
