The presence of popular tracks from this era, known for their lively beats and feel-good vibes, supports walking as a primary use case, particularly for those who enjoy nostalgic music while exercising. The confidence level is high given the direct reference to 'energetic walking' in the query and the alignment of music characteristics with walking workouts, leading to a 'Walking' category score of 0.71. Other categories like 'Running' or 'Treadmill' were less evident due to the absence of higher intensity indicators or specific mentions."
