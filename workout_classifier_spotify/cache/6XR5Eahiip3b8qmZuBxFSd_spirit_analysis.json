  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Marathon hype tf up: running playlist' is strongly aligned with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, earning a score of 0.95. The title itself includes 'hype,' suggesting motivation and high energy, an indicator of intense running sessions. The tracklist overwhelmingly features high-energy tracks with fast tempos, strong beats, and empowering, motivational lyrics. Songs like 'Stronger' by Kanye West, 'POWER' by Kanye West, and 'Empire State Of Mind' by JAY-Z have high energy and intensity.\n\nThe playlist also aligns moderately with 'Flow & Rhythm' at 0.7. Many tracks have consistent beats and tempos facilitating a rhythmic running pace, such as 'Raising Hell - Steve James Remix' by Kesha, which has a danceable remix beat.\n\nThe exclusion of other spirits is due to a predominant focus on high tempo and energy tracks over calming, structured, or explicitly scenic themes. The description and track analysis affirm energetic, motivational music rather than structured or restorative intent."
