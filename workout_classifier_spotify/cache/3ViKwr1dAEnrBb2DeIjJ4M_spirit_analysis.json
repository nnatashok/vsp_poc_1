  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Running Motivation 2025' playlist is primarily defined by high-energy tracks with fast tempos typical of EDM and Techno, as seen in tracks like 'Mission' and 'The Way I Are - Techno Remix' which have BPMs of 140 and 150 respectively. The playlist name itself emphasizes running motivation, suggesting it is designed to boost energy and drive performance, aligned with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, receiving a high score of 0.9. This intense focus on energy is conducive to sprints and fast-paced output, as supported by the popularity and danceability of tracks. Additionally, there's an aspect of 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the continuous beat-driven soundscapes and high danceability that promote a rhythmic movement, earning a score of 0.65. However, the fast and upbeat nature combined with positive lyrical themes of confidence majors more on high-energy alignment, rather than a meditative flow. Less relevance was found for 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits due to the techno and high-energy dance emphasis dominating the playlist."
