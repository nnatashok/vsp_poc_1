  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'morning walks \ud83c\udf05\ud83e\udde1\u2615\ufe0f' is clearly focused on walking, as indicated by the title, which references 'morning walks,' suggesting a leisurely or moderately paced activity suitable for a walking workout. The description, 'For all the crisp morning strolls,' further supports this, as it evokes imagery of relaxed, enjoyable walking. The use of 'strolls' implies a slower, more casual pace rather than the intensity associated with running or jogging. Additionally, the query 'chill walking playlist' reinforces the walking category with an emphasis on a relaxed atmosphere. The tracklist, featuring songs with medium energy and danceability, aligns with the moderate intensity typical of walking activities. With 258 tracks curated for a walking pace, this playlist is highly indicative of a walking workout, warranting a strong score of 0.9 in the Walking category. The absence of any indication of running or treadmill workouts, such as keywords or a higher intensity or BPM, further justifies the exclusion of those categories."
