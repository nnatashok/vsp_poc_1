  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist is classified under the 'Walking' category, with a confidence score of 0.75, suggesting high confidence in this classification. The primary indicators supporting this decision are found in the playlist name and description, which include terms like 'chill' and 'walking playlist.' These terms suggest the music is suitable for a relaxed or leisurely walking experience, aligning with the characteristics of a 'Walking' workout, which tends to have a moderate pace. Additionally, despite the high number of tracks (983), the overall vibe indicated by the genres (R&B, Soul), tempos, and sentiments described as reflective, emotional, or gentle (approximately in the 70-130 BPM range for Frank Ocean songs, with meditative and low-to-medium energy) supports a walking activity rather than more intensive running. The playlist's purpose for relaxation\u2014suitable for other non-exercise activities like sleeping and showering\u2014reinforces this classification. The absence of more intense, upbeat music typically associated with running or treadmill workouts leads to excluding those categories."
