  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'WORKOUT PLAYLIST 2025' and its accompanying metadata indicate a strong focus on running and high-intensity workouts. The title itself includes 'Running Songs' and 'Fitness Hits,' highlighting the playlist's intention to provide music suitable for vigorous activities like running. The query used, 'running playlist,' further reinforces this intent. Additionally, the high-energy tracks, such as 'Still D.R.E.' and 'The Nights,' and their infectious rhythms suggest suitability for running, supporting sustained physical effort. The BPM of tracks like Majestic's 'Rasputin' and Tommy Richman's 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' also align with common music preferences for running. While the playlist seems well-suited for general running, the listing under 'Gym Motivation' suggests it may be used on treadmills as well, which is common in gym settings. Therefore, the scores of 0.9 for Running and 0.7 for Treadmill reflect the strong and relatively clear indications towards these workout types. Walking is not considered a suitable category given the high intensity reflected in the playlist's metadata."
