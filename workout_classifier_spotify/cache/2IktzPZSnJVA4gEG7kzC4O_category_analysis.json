  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist is explicitly titled 'Running Motivation 2025,' directly indicating its purpose for running workouts. This is reinforced by the description 'Run better, run faster,' which suggests a focus on enhancing running performance, likely requiring higher energy levels and motivation. The query 'running inspiration playlist' further confirms this intent. The tracks are characterized by fast tempos, high energy, and danceability, typical of music expected to maintain motivation during a running session. The presence of DJs and artists known for EDM and energetic music supports this classification since these genres are often associated with running playlists due to their motivational qualities. The specific use of phrases like 'motivation' and 'faster' aligns closely with the needs of outdoor or indoor running, rather than more moderate activities such as walking or treadmill workouts. Thus, the confidence in categorizing this as suited for Running is very high, at a score of 0.9, as other categories do not align well with the provided metadata."
