  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Fun Upbeat Walking Songs' is primarily classified under 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a score of 0.8. This is because the metadata reveals a collection of high-energy tracks with strong, consistent beats that promote a smooth and rhythmic walking experience. Songs like 'Better When I'm Dancin'' and 'Uptown Funk (feat. Bruno Mars)' are designed to enhance a continuous, upbeat tempo walk, synchronizing the listener's movements with their dynamic beats. Lyrics and music sentiment are consistently positive, reinforcing the flow and maintaining a joyful rhythm. \n\nThe secondary spirit is 'High-Energy & Intense,' with a score of 0.6. This classification is due to the playlist's energetic nature, characterized by vibrant and fast-paced tracks such as 'I Like To Move It' and 'CAN'T STOP THE FEELING!,' which provide an intense auditory stimulus capable of boosting physical activity levels, although not to the extent typically required for high-intensity runs.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded as the descriptions and upbeat, dance-pop nature of the songs focus on energy and rhythm, not relaxation or explorative soundscapes."
