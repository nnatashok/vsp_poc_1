  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist is titled \"Fast Tempo Walking Songs,\" and the query used was \"energetic walking playlist,\" indicating a primary focus on walking workouts. The high energy and danceability of the tracks further suggest they are suitable for adding rhythm and motivation to a brisk walking session. Many tracks such as 'Moves Like Jagger' by Maroon 5 and 'TiK ToK' by Kesha are pop songs with high BPM, typically associated with an energetic pace suitable for fast-paced walking. Thus, the primary category is Walking with a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe Running category is also somewhat applicable because the playlist's high tempo tracks could be adaptable for light running or jogging due to their tempo and energy level. The use of high-energy tracks with strong beats such as 'TiK ToK' and 'California Gurls' may support a mild running pace. Therefore, Running is assigned a lower score of 0.4 as a secondary category due to less direct alignment with fast-paced running.\n\nThe treadmill category is not explicitly supported by the metadata. The description and tracks suggest more generic outdoor or active walking rather than treadmill-specific activities, so the treadmill category was not assigned."
