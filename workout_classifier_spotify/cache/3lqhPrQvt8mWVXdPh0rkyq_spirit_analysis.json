  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Inspirational Running Playlist' is predominantly composed of high-energy tracks with themes of empowerment and resilience, evident in songs like 'Titanium' by David Guetta and 'Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)' by Kelly Clarkson. These tracks exhibit high energy and danceability, driven by fast tempos and powerful beats, making the playlist a strong match for the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit (score: 0.79). The consistent theme of overcoming adversity and personal empowerment aligns well with intense workouts aimed at pushing personal limits. \n\nFurthermore, tracks with steady beats, like 'Roar' by Katy Perry and 'The Edge Of Glory' by Lady Gaga, support a continuous, flowing motion, aligning with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.6). This helps sync strides with the beat, promoting a rhythmic running experience.\n\nLastly, the playlist's empowering and structured themes, along with the consistent driving beats, also slightly fit the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (score: 0.55), which suits maintaining a steady pace or achieving specific training goals. Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are less represented due to the playlist's high energy and focused empowerment themes."
