  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Running Motivation 2025' strongly supports a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, evident from the use of phrases like 'Run better, run faster.' This indicates the playlist's purpose is to push runners to work harder and increase their pace, in line with the spirit's focus on adrenaline-fueled motivation. The track list, featuring artists like David Guetta and Ti\u00ebsto, and focusing predominantly on dance and EDM genres, supports high energy with fast tempos (e.g., 'Prada' at 142 bpm) and high music energy scores. These characteristics create an optimal environment for intense running sessions. The repetitive high danceability across tracks further highlights a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, helping runners maintain a steady stride with their rhythmic beats. The overall energetic and vibrant tone supports both high-energy exertion and rhythmical flow, though it slightly leans towards energy intensity because of the lyrical focus on motivation and high BPMs."
