  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist is dominated by classic rock tracks, many of which have infectious rhythms and high energy levels - attributes ideal for maintaining a strong, steady running pace. With songs like 'Back In Black', 'Born to Run', and 'Livin On A Prayer', there is a clear focus on tracks that energize and engage, making 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' the most fitting primary vibe. These tracks unify the playlist through their beat-driven nature, perfect for syncing strides on a run. \n\nAdditionally, many tracks like 'Don't Stop Believin'' and 'Born to Run' carry an uplifting, inspirational tone, which aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave', as they build momentum and morale during long runs. These elements suggest a playlist structured to sustain mood and performance.\n\nThe confidence level is high (0.9) because of the strong thematic consistency across numerous well-known, uplifting rock anthems that epitomize power and endurance. The selection of highly popular, upbeat songs reinforces these vibes, making other potential classifications like 'The Adrenaline Rush' less applicable due to the absence of unpredictable or intensely dynamic shifts often found in such vibes."
