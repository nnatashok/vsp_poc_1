  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist title, 'Classic Rock Running Workout Playlist,' explicitly suggests that it is designed for running workouts, implying an emphasis on music suitable for maintaining a rhythmic pace crucial for running activities. The description reinforces this intent by stating it is tailored for those who like to run, providing further evidence of its primary use for outdoor or indoor running. The query used ('running inspiration playlist') also aligns with this purpose by indicating a focus on motivating runners. \n\nWhile the BPM and energetic nature of songs like 'Born to Run' and 'Back in Black' support an energetic running pace, there is no direct indication of treadmill-specific content, which often has differing pacing or environment-specific elements. Thus, 'Treadmill' is not selected. The high energy and rhythm of the music, reflected in genres such as rock and hard rock with medium to high danceability, indicate this playlist is more suited for sustained, dynamic movement over the more relaxed 'Walking' category. The overall evidence strongly supports classifying this under 'Running' with a high confidence score of 0.9."
