  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist is explicitly titled 'RUNNING HYPE PLAYLIST \ud83d\udd0b \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25', clearly indicating that it is designed for running. The description further supports this by describing it as 'perfect when you need songs to get you hyped up during your run.' These specific terms strongly suggest the playlist's purpose is to invigorate runners, which aligns with a Running workout category. Additionally, the tracklist features high-energy songs like 'Sandstorm - Radio Edit' by Darude and 'Empire State Of Mind' by JAY-Z, which have fast tempos and high energy levels, fitting for maintaining a vigorous running pace.\n\nThe scores assigned reflect the strong presence and clear focus on running, with a score of 0.9 for the Running category. The absence of any reference to walking or treadmill workouts in the title or description justifies excluding those categories for this analysis."
