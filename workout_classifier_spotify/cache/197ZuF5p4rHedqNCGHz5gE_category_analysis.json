The tracks listed, such as 'Yeah!' by Usher and 'Don't Stop The Music' by Rihanna, are energetic pop and RnB songs with a high BPM and danceability, suitable for maintaining a brisk walking pace. The tags, description, and music choice all suggest a focus on energizing and motivating walking workouts, resulting in a high confidence score of 0.9 for the Walking category.
