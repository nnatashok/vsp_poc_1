  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist is titled 'Best walking songs,' with a specified query 'energetic walking playlist,' which clearly suggests that the songs are intended for walking workouts. Most tracks listed are iconic songs from soul, disco, and pop genres with high energy and danceability, such as 'Respect' by Aretha Franklin and 'I Will Survive' by Gloria Gaynor, which support moderate to brisk walking by providing a consistent beat and encouraging an energetic pace. The steady tempo of around 115-130 bpm across many tracks is ideal for maintaining a walking rhythm. This evidence strongly supports the 'Walking' category with a high confidence score (0.85) and presence (0.9), as these energetic tracks are tailored for a walking workout experience. No indicators suggest the playlist suits running or treadmill-specific sessions, thus these categories were excluded."
