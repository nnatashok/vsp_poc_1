  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'HAPPY ENERGY' was classified primarily under 'Walking' due to several factors. The playlist is described as containing 'upbeat songs for getting through the morning routine, exercising, cleaning, or for whenever you need a boost of positive energy.' This indicates general uplifting and moderately paced activities, aligning well with brisk walking rather than intensive running or treadmill sessions. The query used, 'energetic walking playlist', further supports this categorization, suggesting a focus on walking as an exercise. \n\nFurthermore, tracks like 'You Make My Dreams', 'Here Comes The Sun', and 'Lovely Day' exhibit medium to high energy, high danceability, and high valence, which are suitable for walking to encourage a positive and energizing pace. \n\nFor the 'Running' category, the playlist might still appeal to those seeking a light running session, as indicated by the energetic and positive nature of the tracks like 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams, which has a high BPM (160) suitable for running. However, the overall energy and style seem more tailored to walking, thus 'Running' was scored lower. \n\n'Treadmill' was excluded as the playlist doesn\u2019t explicitly suggest an indoor or treadmill-specific workout, and the general tone leans towards outdoor or casual exercise."
