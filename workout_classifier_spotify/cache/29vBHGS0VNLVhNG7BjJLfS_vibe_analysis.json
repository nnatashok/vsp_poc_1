Songs like 'POWER' by Kanye West and 'Eye of the Tiger' by Survivor provide a strong, driving rhythm, and themes of perseverance and inner strength, aligning with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe aimed at pushing limits. Similarly, the fast tempo and energetic feel of tracks like 'Can't Hold Us' suggest a 'Firestarter' vibe, perfect for short, high-intensity bursts. Additionally, the unpredictable rhythms and dynamic pacing of some tracks imply an 'Adrenaline Rush' vibe, supporting varied pace running. The playlist consistently emphasizes intensity, motivation, and tempo, clear indicators of these selected vibes. Confidence is moderate (0.7) due to a cohesive energy across tracks, despite some diversity in musical styles."
