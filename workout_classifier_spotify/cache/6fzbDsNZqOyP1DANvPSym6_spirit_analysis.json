  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'HAPPY GIRL MORNING POWER WALK' suggests an upbeat and positive walking experience, which aligns well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to its smooth, tempo-driven tracks that support steady, continuous movement. Tracks like 'Green Light' by Lorde and 'Golden' by Harry Styles provide a consistent beat and rhythm ideal for syncing stride, earning this spirit a high score of 0.8.\n\nThe playlist also reflects elements of the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, with its use of consistent, medium-to-high energy pop songs that maintain a specific tempo throughout, supporting a purposeful walking pace and rhythm. This is evident from the energetic walking query and structured pop tracks like 'Money, Money, Money' by ABBA, resulting in a score of 0.6.\n\nFinally, there are mild elements of a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as some tracks convey positive and relaxed emotions that could support a calming walk, hence a lower score of 0.4 for this spirit. The playlist does not fit the 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits, given its focus on pop energy rather than adrenaline or nature exploration."
