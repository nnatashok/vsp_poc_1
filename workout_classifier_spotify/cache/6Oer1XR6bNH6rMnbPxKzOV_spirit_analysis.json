  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Top 100 Motivational Songs in The World!' heavily emphasizes motivational and empowering themes, as seen in titles like 'Unstoppable', 'Fight Song', and 'Eye of the Tiger'. These tracks often have high energy levels and fast tempos (e.g., 174 BPM for Sia's 'Unstoppable') that create a vigorous and exciting atmosphere, matching the High-Energy & Intense spirit with a score of 0.7. This is suitable for pushing personal limits during runs. The consistent use of motivational messages in many tracks suggests a Flow & Rhythm spirit as well, offering a steady motivational background ideal for maintaining pace in a rhythmic manner, earning a score of 0.6. The presence of many structured motivational anthems also indicates elements of the Structured & Disciplined spirit, albeit to a lesser degree (score 0.4), which can help runners focus on specific training goals. Soothing & Restorative and Outdoor & Adventure spirits are less applicable given the intense motivational focus of the playlist."
