  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist \"Good songs for fast walking\" comprises energetic and lively tracks with a focus on pop and upbeat genres, making it ideal for a rhythmic walking pace. The presence of tracks like Pharrell Williams' 'Happy' and multiple selections from the energizing 'Mamma Mia!' soundtrack supports the Flow & Rhythm spirit with a 0.75 score. This is due to their consistent, high-energy beats that encourage a steady walking rhythm while offering a blend of positivity and movement synchronization. Meanwhile, the inclusion of globally recognized anthems like Shakira's 'Waka Waka' and 'Whenever, Wherever' contribute to an Outdoor & Adventure spirit, scoring 0.65, by evoking a sense of exploration and connection with wider cultural melodies. Both spirits suit the playlist's fast walking intent, but while Flow & Rhythm is more prominent due to the musical tempo consistency, Outdoor & Adventure is enhanced by the international and environmental flavors of select tracks."
