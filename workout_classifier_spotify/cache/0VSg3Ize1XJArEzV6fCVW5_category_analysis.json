  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist is clearly focused on running based on several strong indicators in the metadata. The title, 'Running Playlist 2025 \ud83d\udc5f 120-150 BPM,' directly references running, suggesting it is suited for this activity. The description reinforces it further with terms like 'best Running Music 2025,' 'best Running Songs,' and 'jogging playlist,' emphasizing its purpose for running workouts. The BPM range of 120-150 also suggests a tempo suitable for maintaining a steady running pace, important for both outdoor running and treadmill workouts.\n\nWhile the primary category is 'Running,' the playlist also supports 'Treadmill' activities. The consistent BPM and energetic, danceable tracks make it ideal for indoor treadmill running, where maintaining a constant speed is crucial. However, there's no direct mention of walking, reduced pace, or recovery elements, thus excluding the 'Walking' category. Overall, there's high confidence in the classification as the evidence strongly aligns with the workout's intended purpose."
