  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist 'Top 100 Running Songs' is a collection designed for running, with tracks featuring high energy, fast tempos, and strong beats, indicative of either high-intensity or steady-paced running environments. The presence of EDM and pop tracks like 'Take over Control' by AFROJACK and 'Crazy In Love' by Beyonc\u00e9 suggests an upbeat mood and energetic delivery, aligning with 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe, which is suitable for intense and dynamic running sessions. This vibe is further supported by the track selection aiming to spike the listener's heart rate with unpredictably intense rhythms.\n\nMoreover, the consistent rhythmic drive across tracks like Bruno Mars' 'Runaway Baby' and Chris Brown's 'Yeah 3x' supports a strong, steady run or power walk, earning a secondary classification of 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse.' This classification fits due to the beat-driven nature of the playlist that maintains high energy and fluidity, making it ideal for synchronized movement.\n\nExcluded vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' and 'The Firestarter' were not selected as the playlist focuses on steady energy without overtly aggressive tones or explosive beats. Overall confidence is high at 0.85, given the clear indicators of intensity and rhythm suitable for running."
