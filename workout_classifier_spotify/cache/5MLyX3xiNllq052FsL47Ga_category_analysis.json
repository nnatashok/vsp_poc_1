  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist \"Jogging Music 2025 \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf51\" is explicitly designed for running, as indicated by the repeated use of terms such as 'Running Music Hits', 'Songs To run to', and 'Run Music' in the description. The inclusion of phrases such as 'Electronic Running' and 'Motivation Mix' further supports the idea that this playlist is tailored to provide a high-energy, motivating soundtrack suitable for running sessions. The description also mentions 'Cardio', suggesting the playlist is intended for high-intensity workouts, characteristic of running and treadmill workouts. While the term 'Jogging' in the title suggests outdoor running, the inclusion of 'Treadmill' as a secondary category reflects its potential suitability for indoor running on treadmills. The tracklist supports this classification with high-energy, danceable music featuring fast tempos and high valence, ideal for sustaining physical effort during running. However, the explicit focus on running in the metadata justifies assigning the highest score to the Running category (1.0), while Treadmill is assigned a secondary significance (0.7). Walking is not considered due to the playlist's high-energy nature and target audience."
