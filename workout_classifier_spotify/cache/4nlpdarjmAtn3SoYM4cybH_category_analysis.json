  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'walking in an empty street' is best classified under 'Walking' due to several indicators. The title explicitly mentions walking, suggesting it is geared towards a walking activity rather than running or treadmill-specific exercises. The description states 'chiller songs,' implying a relaxed and low-intensity use, consistent with walking rather than running. Additionally, the query 'chill walking playlist' suggests a casual listening experience suited for moderate pace walking, which aligns with the nature of a walking workout. Many tracks have a relatively low to medium BPM, such as 'WILDFLOWER' with a BPM of 94 and 'What Was I Made For?' with a BPM of 60, suitable for a casual walk. The overall energy and danceability described in the tracks analysis indicate mellow and balanced dynamics typical for a walking pace exercise. Therefore, the high confidence score of 0.85 reflects strong indicators supporting the walking category from the metadata."
