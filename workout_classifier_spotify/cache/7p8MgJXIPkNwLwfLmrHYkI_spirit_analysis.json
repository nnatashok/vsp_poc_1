  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'calm walking playlist\ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2640\ufe0f' is clearly targeted towards calm and relaxing experiences, as indicated by the title. The overall selection of tracks from artists like John Mayer, Jack Johnson, and The Script typically fit into a mellower pop and pop-rock genre, which naturally supports a Soothing & Restorative spirit. Songs such as 'The Scientist' by Coldplay and 'Chasing Cars' by Snow Patrol contribute to this restful quality with their medium tempo and reflective lyrics. The playlist's intended chill vibe emphasizes aspects of relaxation and emotional reset typical of the Soothing & Restorative spirit, justifying a high score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, many songs possess a continuous rhythmic quality that could support a meditative walking pace, such as Jack Johnson\u2019s \u2018Better Together\u2019 and John Mayer\u2019s \u2018Waiting On the World to Change\u2019, aligning with a Flow & Rhythm spirit, albeit to a lesser degree (score 0.7). The consistent smooth tempo and the emotional tone across the tracklist indicate the moderate inclusion of this spirit. Other spirits like High-Energy & Intense or Structured & Disciplined were excluded as these tracks generally lack aggressive energy or rigorous structure needed for those activities."
