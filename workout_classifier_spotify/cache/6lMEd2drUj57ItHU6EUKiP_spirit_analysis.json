  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Inspirational Running Playlist' embodies a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to the prevalent fast tempos and high energy across tracks. For instance, 'Fight Song' by Rachel Platten has a BPM of 176, indicative of an adrenaline-fueled, motivating environment, perfect for intense running sessions (score: 0.7). Additionally, songs like 'Alive' by Hillsong Young & Free and 'Fire' by Attaboy maintain high energy and danceability, driving physical output and encouraging runners to push their limits.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also significant, as many tracks feature consistent beats and positive themes that support maintaining steady rhythm and contribution to a runner's stride. With songs like 'For All Seasons' and Hillsong's 'Alive,' the smooth electronic and band-driven elements promote a continuous and immersive running experience (score: 0.6).\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is somewhat represented through thematic elements found in inspiring and empowerment-focused lyrics like in 'Dare You to Move' by Switchfoot and 'Hero' by Skillet, suggesting exploration and personal journeys in nature (score: 0.5). The moderate match acknowledges this spirit's presence while noting that the primary focus leans towards energetic and flow-based running environments. Alternative spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded due to the overall dynamic and motivational nature of the playlist."
