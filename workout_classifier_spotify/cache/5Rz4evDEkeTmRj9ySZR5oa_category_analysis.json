  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'Epic Music for Running' is heavily aligned with running as a workout category. The title explicitly mentions 'running,' indicating that the playlist is intended to accompany running exercises. The description supports this with language such as 'inspiration,' 'motivation,' 'adrenaline pumping,' and references to training for marathons or various run lengths. These terms suggest a high-intensity, endurance-focused activity typically associated with running rather than walking or treadmill use. \n\nThe tracklist further emphasizes epic, high-energy, and motivational music often used to boost stamina and mental focus during outdoor or indoor runs. Genres like 'Epic Hybrid Action Metal' and 'Epic Orchestral Music' add to the motivational scope suitable for running, as they feature high BPM and dynamic arrangements to maintain momentum. The variety in track bpm (115 to 203) and emphasis on 'epic' themes strongly resonate with the demands of running workouts that require consistent and elevated energy levels over potentially long durations. \n\nWhile the playlist could technically be used for high-intensity treadmill running, the lack of specificity in the metadata about treadmills and the emphasis on broader running scenarios led to the exclusion of the 'Treadmill' category."
