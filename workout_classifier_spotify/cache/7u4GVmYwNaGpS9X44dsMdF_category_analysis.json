This clear alignment with walking as an intended activity is reinforced by the popularity of the 'Hot Girl Walk' concept, which involves leisurely outdoor walks with a motivational focus.\n\nThe presence of energetic and danceable pop tracks, such as 'greedy' by Tate McRae and 'bad idea right?' by Olivia Rodrigo, supports a lively walking pace suitable for outdoor walks. The search query 'energetic walking playlist' also directly aligns with walking as a category. The playlist's music energy and high danceability further indicate an experience best suited for walking workouts.\n\nWhile the playlist does not specifically mention running or treadmills, all signs suggest walking is the primary activity. Therefore, the 'Walking' category is assigned with a high confidence score of 0.9, as it is clearly the central focus of the playlist and its description."
