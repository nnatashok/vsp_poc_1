  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'On The Mat' and the image shows an individual standing on a mat. This suggests that a mat is used for floor exercises or mobility work, which aligns with the focus on 'holding corrective positions' and 'releasing tension' as mentioned in the description. This supports a very high confidence that a mat is required, as it is central to the workout's format."
