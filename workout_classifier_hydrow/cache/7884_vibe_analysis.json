  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video 'Whole Body Stretch' clearly aligns with a \"The Reboot Workout\" vibe due to its focus on stretching multiple body parts. The mention of 'scenery of Norway' suggests a calm and refreshing ambiance, supporting a score of 0.8. Additionally, the description of a variety of stretches indicates a holistic approach to bodily refreshment. \n\n\"The Zen Flow\" vibe also fits well, scored at 0.7. The gentle nature of stretching exercises and the outdoor setting contribute to a grounding and intentional practice, focused on breath and relaxation.\n\nThe \"Nature Flow\" is considered due to the scenic environment of Norway, adding a natural, rhythm-infused element to the stretch routine. The playlist includes artists like Kygo, whose music might support an expressive, melodic experience, thus a score of 0.6. \n\nThe absence of intense or competitive indicators excludes higher intensity vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Competitor.\" The overall evidence for the selected vibes is solid, with slight ambiguity due to the varied music genre."
