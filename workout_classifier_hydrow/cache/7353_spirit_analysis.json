  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Pitter Patter Row' is best classified under 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure'.\n\n1. **Flow & Rhythm (Score: 0.75)**: The title 'Pitter Patter Row' and description emphasize rhythm shifts ('Anticipate rhythm shifts with Dani'), suggesting a focus on smooth, coordinated movements synchronized with music. The use of a Dance mid playlist supports a rhythmic focus, enhancing the mind-body connection central to Flow & Rhythm.\n\n2. **Outdoor & Adventure (Score: 0.8)**: The workout is conducted on the water in Newport, CA, as shown in the image, which aligns with the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. Rowing outdoors involves engaging with the natural environment, offering a sense of exploration and adventure.\n\nGiven the focus on rhythm and outdoor setting, there is less emphasis on high intensity (evidenced by an intensity level of 1) or detailed structure, while the outdoor component strongly complements a rhythmic approach."
