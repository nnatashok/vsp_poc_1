  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Growth Mindset Row\" appears to focus on a mindful approach to rowing, as indicated by the use of the phrase \"growth mindset\" in the description, which suggests a meditative and reflective intent, aligning with the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit (score 0.75). The emphasis on low rhythms and intervals point towards controlled, musical pacing, further supporting this classification.\n\nAdditionally, the image depicts outdoor rowing on a river, leading to a strong alignment with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit (score 0.8). This setting in nature adds an element of exploration and environmental connection, reinforcing the adventure spirit.\n\nThe intensity level being stated as low and the workout type labeled as \"breathe\" imply a relaxed, low-stress session, which aligns with the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit (score 0.6). The calming music playlist consisting of classic upbeat tunes like \"Walking On Sunshine\" and \"Celebration\" provides an uplifting yet relaxing atmosphere.\n\n\"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Sport & Agility\" were excluded due to lack of evidence for high intensity or sports-specific movements."
