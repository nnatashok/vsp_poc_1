  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'Breathe' and 'row' session, which inherently suggests a simpler form of exercise featuring basic rowing motions. The metadata emphasizes a gradual rhythm increase, aligning with beginner progression. The lack of complex technical cues supports a 'Beginner' classification. However, the inclusion of 'Climb' format with a moderate max rhythm of 24 slightly raises the potential technique complexity, justifying a minor consideration for 'Intermediate'.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is approachable at 21 minutes, and the intensity is specified as 1 out of 3, indicating a gentle effort level. Sera Moon's narrative leans towards an encouraging but not overly strenuous workout aimed at those recovering or restarting fitness routines. The rhythmic build may require some effort, suggesting a slight influence into 'Moderate' effort. However, absent high-intensity intervals or heavy exertion, it aligns most with 'Light' effort difficulty.",
