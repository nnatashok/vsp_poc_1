  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title 'Chicago River Bow View' and the description 'Navigate down the Chicago River on a sunny day' strongly indicate an outdoor setting, specifically on a river, which matches the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit perfectly. It explicitly mentions navigating the river, suggesting that this was recorded in a natural waterway setting. The reference to a journey and categorization under 'Journeys' further reinforces this spirit, implying exploration and engagement with the environment. There is no mention of high intensity, flow techniques, or specific training structures, which excludes the other spirits. The confidence level is set at 0.85 due to the very explicit mention of an outdoor river setting."
