  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Baseball Row' workout combines structured interval training with light-hearted elements, characterized by alternating between 22 and 28 strokes per minute. The mix of steady jogs and sprinting implies a gradual increase in intensity, suggesting 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe due to its focus on steady energy build-up. The dance and global hits music genres and humorous commentary align with 'The Groove Session' vibe, as they create a fun and engaging experience. The workout's interval format and rowing focus align slightly with 'The Meditative Grind,' emphasizing repetition and endurance, but to a lesser extent due to the interval nature. The 2 out of 3 intensity level suggests a balanced yet energetic experience. The combination of humor and rhythm marks a dynamic yet consistent experience, excluding more intense vibes like 'The Adrenaline Rush.' Overall, the workout integrates rhythm and energy with technical rowing elements without being overly intense or calm, fitting 'The Endorphin Wave' and 'The Groove Session' themes."
