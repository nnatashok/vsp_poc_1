Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 15 minutes suggests a short session, supporting a 'Light' classification. Rowing at a steady pace on flat water typically results in low energy expenditure, suitable for beginners. However, the presence of 'journey' in the description may indicate some sustained effort, which provides a moderate alignment with 'Moderate' effort difficulty. Thus, the primary classification is 'Light', supported by a strong score of 0.7, with a secondary score of 0.3 for 'Moderate'.",
