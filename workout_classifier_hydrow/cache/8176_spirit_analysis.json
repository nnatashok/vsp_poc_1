  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the emphasis on rhythms of 18, 22, and 24, which suggests a smooth and continuous pace. The mention of 'cruise' aligns well with the concept of maintaining a steady, rhythmic flow. The music playlist, featuring tracks that promote steady beats and rhythm, supports this classification, giving it a score of 0.75 due to strong evidence from pacing and music.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is highly relevant here, with a score of 0.7, as the rowing session occurs on a river, utilizing natural elements of outdoor rowing. The image confirms this, highlighting the natural environment in which the workout takes place.\n\n'Soothing & Restorative' is given a moderate score of 0.5. The workout's 'breathe' type and low intensity level (1 out of 3) suggest a calming and restorative element, particularly with the emphasis on finding power in a controlled, rhythmic manner. Although there is some ambiguity due to the power focus, the overall relaxed pacing contributes to this spirit."
