Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 20 minutes and description of a 'faster paced power flow' contribute to a Moderate effort difficulty. This suggests a continuous sequence of movements with a moderate energy demand, suitable for those with some base level of fitness. The music's cool and downtempo tempo further supports a more controlled pace, thus placing most emphasis on sustained moderate effort rather than high-intensity bursts, hence the Moderate rating with some recognition of a potentially Challenging aspect.",
