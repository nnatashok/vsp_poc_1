  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout has a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to its intervals format and a maximum rhythm of 30, along with the intensity level marked as 3 out of 3. These elements collectively indicate a fast-paced and challenging session, suitable for high-energy workouts. The presence of popular and global hits in the music adds to this energetic and intense atmosphere, leading to a high confidence and score of 0.9 for this spirit. The outdoor setting indicated by racing down the Brazos River in Waco, Texas, aligns tightly with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The direct mention of the river in a new location for the platform is strongly indicative of an adventure out in nature, hence the 0.8 score. The title 'April Race' and the involvement of racing imply elements of competition and performance, which are consistent with the 'Sport & Agility' spirit. The term 'Drive' in the workout category further supports this classification, considering a 0.75 score. Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are not applicable given the competitive and high-intensity emphasis."
