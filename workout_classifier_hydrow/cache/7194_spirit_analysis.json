  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit identified for this workout is 'Outdoor & Adventure', with a high score of 0.8. This conclusion is drawn from the title 'Port of LA Stern View', the description 'Row in the Port of LA on this sunny day', and the category 'Journeys'. These elements clearly indicate that the workout takes place outdoors on a body of water, enhancing the sense of adventure that comes with rowing in a natural setting. Additionally, the tag 'journey' reinforces the concept of exploration, a key trait of the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm', with a score of 0.6. This spirit is indicated by the continuous motion likely involved in a 15-minute rowing session, which typically aligns with smooth, rhythmic movement patterns. Although the exact music genre is unspecified, the rhythm of rowing itself can create a flow state, justifying its inclusion. Other potential spirits were excluded due to the lack of evidence of structured protocols, high intensity, or restorative elements in the metadata."
