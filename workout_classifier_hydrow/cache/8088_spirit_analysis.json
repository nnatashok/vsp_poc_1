  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Core Focused Row' embodies several spirits, primarily due to its components and setting. 'Outdoor & Adventure' is prominent as the session is conducted on a river, providing a natural, exploratory element typically associated with this spirit. The score of 0.8 reflects the clear environmental outdoor setting. \n\nThe structured nature of maintaining a 'pace' and specific '2 and 3-minute efforts at rhythm 26' aligns with 'High-Energy & Intense' as these indicate a session focused on exerting effort and maintaining a demanding pace, supported by the intense music playlist of Hip Hop/R&B.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also present with a score of 0.6; the rhythm-focused description suggests a coordinated, music-driven approach to the workout, enhancing mind-body connection through rhythm.\n\nWhile 'Structured & Disciplined' could be a consideration, the lack of explicit mention of technical precision or a methodical training plan lowers its relevance. The overall intensity level and music choice further support these choices."
