  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is identified as a 'Cool-Down,' focusing on reinforcing 'good technique with two strokes on two strokes off drills.' This indicates a mindfulness and recovery emphasis, making 'Soothing & Restorative' a strong fit with a score of 0.7. This spirit is also supported by the cool-down nature of the workout. The image shows rowing on a river, which implies an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, scoring 0.8, as it aligns with a natural setting exploration. The workout's emphasis on technique drills and a set rhythm suggests a 'Structured & Disciplined' element, meriting a score of 0.6. The absence of a high-intensity focus and soothing music choices further confirm these spirits. Other spirits, like 'High-Energy & Intense,' are excluded due to the focus on cooling down and technique rather than exertion and speed."
