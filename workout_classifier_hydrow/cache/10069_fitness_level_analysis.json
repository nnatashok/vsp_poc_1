  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'Drive' category, which is a Hydrow-specific type indicating a higher level of complexity. It involves 1-minute HIIT intervals with a rhythm of 34+, which requires some coordination and technique, aligning it with an Intermediate level for technique difficulty. Given the metadata, such as short intervals and maximizing rhythm, this demands good rowing form and some level of skill.",
