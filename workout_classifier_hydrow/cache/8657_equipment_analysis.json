  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"HIIT Row\" and falls under the category \"row,\" indicating a strong focus on rowing exercises. The description mentions high-intensity intervals, which are commonly performed on a rowing machine. Given the combination of the HIIT format and the explicit mention of rowing, the rowing machine is essential for this workout, justifying a very high confidence score of 1. Although the image shows outdoor rowing, the metadata suggests it's an indoor rowing session, reinforcing the necessity of a rowing machine."
