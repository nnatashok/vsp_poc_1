  "vibesExplanation": "The selected workout vibes are based on several key aspects of the workout metadata. The primary vibe assigned is 'The Firestarter' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is due to the emphasis on 'sprinting intervals' and 'anaerobic capacity,' which align closely with fast, explosive, and intense workouts. The short duration of 21 minutes and high intensity level (3 out of 3) further support this classification.\n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Competitor' with a score of 0.6. This choice is influenced by the structured 'interval' format and the challenging 'drive' workout type, invoking a competitive and goal-oriented experience.\n\nLastly, 'The Nightclub Workout' is chosen with a score of 0.5, based on the music genres 'Dance high' and 'Global Hits,' alongside a playlist featuring high-energy dance tracks (e.g., 'Big Energy' and 'Drop That Low'). These musical elements suggest a rhythmic, party-like atmosphere.\n\nAlthough 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe is less pronounced compared to 'The Firestarter,' the music style boosts the vibe's relevance. Other potential vibes, such as 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Disciplined Grind,' were excluded due to the workout\u2019s focus on explosive interval training rather than steady endurance or disciplined repetition."
