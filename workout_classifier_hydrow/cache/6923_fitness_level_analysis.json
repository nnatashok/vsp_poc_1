  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout falls under the 'row' category, which typically includes either Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty. The intervals involve adjusting rhythms up to 24, which is within a manageable range for beginners as long as instructional cues are provided. The workout is part of the 'breathe' category, suggesting a focus on maintaining a steady breathing pattern, often indicative of lower complexity. This supports a technique difficulty score primarily in the Beginner range, with a minor consideration for Intermediate due to the interval nature.",

This setup suggests a Light effort difficulty, reflecting a session that requires less physical exertion overall. However, the interval format could pose some challenge to complete beginners, warranting a slight moderation inclusion.",
