The workout involves intervals, which adds some complexity but doesn\u2019t surpass Intermediate technique requirements. No advanced techniques like complex lifts or yoga poses are mentioned, thus aligning primarily with Beginner to Intermediate difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout uses a HIIT format involving 30 and 60-second intervals, which increases physical demand. It is described as 'igniting legs and lungs,' indicating a metabolic demand higher than light effort but suitable for moderate challenges. The duration is relatively short at 11 minutes, but the intensity level is noted at 2 out of 3, suggesting both moderate and challenging scores. The rhythm is set at a max of 28, reinforcing this mid-level effort. Overall, it falls between Moderate and Challenging in effort.",
