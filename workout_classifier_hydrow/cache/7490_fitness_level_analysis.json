  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is 5:46, and it serves as a warm-up, both indicating low energy expenditure. However, terms like 'increase your rhythm and effort' suggest a slightly elevated physical demand, appropriate for building up towards more intense sessions. This makes it light in terms of effort, with moderate alignment from the gradual increase in rhythm.",
