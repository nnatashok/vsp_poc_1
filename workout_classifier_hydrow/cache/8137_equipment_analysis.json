  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly categorized under 'row', indicating that a rowing machine is required. The description, mentioning a '1-minute challenge for maximum meters,' further supports the use of rowing equipment, as it aligns with typical rowing exercise goals. Additionally, the image shows rowing activity, reinforcing the necessity of a rowing machine. With 'row' being part of the workout category and the focus on power and rhythm, there is very high confidence (1.0) that a rowing machine is the central piece of equipment needed."
