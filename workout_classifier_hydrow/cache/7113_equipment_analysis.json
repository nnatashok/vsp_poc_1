  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Steady State Row' is classified under the 'row' category, which indicates that a rowing machine is necessary for this workout. The description emphasizes rowing steadily at a 22 rhythm, which is consistent with the use of an indoor rowing machine. Additionally, the mention of building endurance further suggests the use of a rowing machine, as it is an effective tool for cardiovascular training. Despite the outdoor image shown, the context of the metadata focuses on indoor rowing. Therefore, the rowing machine is identified as required with very high confidence (1.0)."
