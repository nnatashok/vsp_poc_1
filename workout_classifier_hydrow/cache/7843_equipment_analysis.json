  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled 'Consistency Row,' and it is categorized under 'row,' making it clear that a rowing machine is central to the workout. The description mentions 'sets of intervals within a 5-minute block,' typical of rowing sessions designed to track consistency in row performance. The mention of 'maintain a consistent split' also indicates rowing activity. While the image shows an individual in an outdoor rowing scenario, the term 'row' and the indoor workout context imply the use of an indoor rowing machine. This analysis leads to a high confidence score of 0.95 for the rowing machine."
