  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given that the workout is categorized under 'row', the technique difficulty is either Beginner or Intermediate. The title 'Rejuvenation Row' and the fact that it consists of short intervals suggest a focus on maintaining good rowing form without overly complex movements. Rowing generally involves basic to moderate coordination, which aligns with a technique difficulty of Beginner to Intermediate. Aquil's status as an experienced Olympian, which might suggest advanced technique, is balanced by the need to accommodate less experienced users, supporting the Intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of 21 minutes and utilizes an interval format, which can be physically demanding, especially at a max rhythm of 28 strokes per minute. This is supported by the 'sweat' workout type and the given intensity level of 2 out of 3. Such factors contribute to a moderate energy expenditure, while the potential for high effort during intervals points towards a challenging classification as well.",
