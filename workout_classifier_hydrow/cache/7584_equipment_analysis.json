  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the category 'row', which strongly indicates the need for a rowing machine. Additionally, the title 'Versatility Row' and the workout format 'Climb' imply the workout involves varying stroke rates, typical in rowing exercises. Despite the image showing an outdoor rowing scene, the context within the video metadata suggests an indoor rowing workout, hence the identification of the rowing machine with very high confidence."
