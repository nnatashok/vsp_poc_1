  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Creative Passions Row' combines rowing with a unique exploration of Granville Island, suggesting an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit, as the activity is taking place on the water and involves discovering artistic locations. The use of intervals (3, 2, and 1-minute intervals) indicates a \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit with clear segments targeting specific effort levels, aligning with a more methodical workout approach. The music choices, with emphasis on rhythm-driven indie alternative and global hits, support a \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit, contributing to a continuous, enjoyable movement pace during the rowing. The inclusion of upbeat tracks like 'On Top Of The World' and relaxed vibes from 'Is This Love (Remix)' facilitate a rhythmic rowing experience. Overall, the meta tags, structure, and music collectively inform these spirit classifications, with high confidence in the outdoor setting and rhythmic flow."
