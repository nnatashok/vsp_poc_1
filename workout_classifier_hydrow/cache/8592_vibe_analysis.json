  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for the workout is 'The Reboot Workout' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is based on the focus on 'stretching' and 'maintaining a healthy back' as mentioned in the description, aligning with the idea of a 'total-body refresh' common in reboot-style workouts. The workout duration of 15:35 also supports a short yet effective form of recovery.\n\nThe presence of a dance and global hits playlist suggests a somewhat lively atmosphere, but not intense enough to classify the vibe as 'The Nightclub Workout'. Instead, it indicates a moderate presence of rhythm, supporting 'The Zen Flow' vibe, with a score of 0.6. This vibe is linked to being 'grounding, intentional', which aligns with stretching activities, though the beat-driven nature adds a unique element that is not purely meditative or slow-paced.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' and 'The Groove Session' were considered but excluded due to the emphasis on stretching for back health rather than a fluid, expressive movement or repetitive zone-in activities. The dance-inclusive playlist differentiates this from a purely Zen or grind vibe."
