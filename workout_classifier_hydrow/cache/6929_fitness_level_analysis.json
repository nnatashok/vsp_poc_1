  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'drive' and includes rhythm climbing to 32 strokes per minute, which implies a need for coordination and control. Given that Hydrow-specific rules apply with this being a 'Drive' workout, it defaults to an advanced level of technique. However, considering the rowing constraints, the technique complexity is capped at Intermediate, aligning with the categorized Drive workout class's requirements.",
