  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Stag Row' primarily aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, given the setting on a river, as seen in the image. This outdoor environment inherently brings elements of exploration and nature into the workout, justifying a strong score of 0.8. The workout also fits the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the interval format and mid-intensity music playlist featuring songs like 'Everybody Wants To Rule The World,' which support a rhythmic, continuous motion at a moderate pace, earning a score of 0.7. The presence of structured intervals (2' and 3' lengths) and a designated format contribute to the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, earning it a score of 0.6. Although the workout is labeled as 'sweat,' the intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggests a moderate level of exertion, which aligns more with structured pacing and rhythm rather than high intensity."
