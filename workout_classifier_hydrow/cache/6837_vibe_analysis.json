  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Relax + Reflect Cool-Down' workout is focused on calming and reflective activities, which aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe due to its emphasis on being grounding and breath-centered. This is supported by the description, 'Calm your body and mind.' The inclusion of indie alternative and global hits music, known for their soothing qualities, reinforces this vibe. The scoring for 'The Zen Flow' is 0.75, reflecting strong alignment and theme.\n\n' The Reboot Workout' is also applicable, given the workout's nature as a cool-down aimed at refreshing the body post-exercise. The gentle, calming strokes match the low-stress, refreshment-focused attributes of this vibe, earning a score of 0.65 due to its fit with the workout type.\n\nThe steady format and reflective aspect also lend some characteristics of 'The Meditative Grind,' although to a lesser extent. The repeated strokes and the setting make it marginally fit within this vibe, giving it a moderate score of 0.5."
