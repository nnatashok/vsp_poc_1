  "vibesExplanation": "The main focus on 'hip mobility' and 'no additional equipment' in the description strongly suggest a vibe aligned with 'The Reboot Workout,' which involves gentle stretching and low-stress movement, capturing the essence of this workout focus (score: 0.75). The inclusion of Latin and Global Hits music, featuring artists like J Balvin and Don Omar, infuses a fun, expressive feel to the session, leading to the inclusion of 'The Groove Session' vibe (score: 0.6). Finally, as mobility exercises aim to strengthen weak points and improve basic movement patterns, 'The Foundation Builder' is relevant, accounting for the grounded nature of this routine (score: 0.5). The combination of music genre and exercise type creates a unique experience that is reflected in these vibes."
