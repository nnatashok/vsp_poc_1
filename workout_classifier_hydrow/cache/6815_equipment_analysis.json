  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row,' which typically indicates that a rowing machine is central to the exercise, despite the cool-down focus. The description emphasizes a mind and body cool-down, suggesting a light use of a rowing machine to maintain physiological engagement. Although the equipment list is empty, the image suggests rowing activity. Given these factors, a high confidence level is assigned to the rowing machine as needed equipment."
