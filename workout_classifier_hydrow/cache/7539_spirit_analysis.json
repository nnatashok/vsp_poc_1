  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Be Present Row' primarily embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to its focus on being 'present with your emotions' and building a cardio base at 'low rhythms'. The music playlist, featuring calming soul and Motown hits, further supports a restorative and emotionally engaging atmosphere, earning this spirit a score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present, with a moderate score of 0.7, driven by the workout\u2019s emphasis on steady pace, rhythm, and mind-body presence. These aspects of flow and connection are reinforced by the music style.\n\nFinally, the image shows rowing in an outdoor setting, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This connection to the natural environment and open water justifies a strong score of 0.8 for this spirit, as it introduces elements of exploration and connection to nature.\n\nOverall, other potential spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the workout's low intensity and focus on breathing and presence rather than technical structure or intensity."
