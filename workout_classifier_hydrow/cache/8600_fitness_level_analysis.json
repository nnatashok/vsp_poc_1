  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', which typically aligns with either Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty levels. The description does not indicate complex technical aspects beyond standard rowing, suggesting a strong fit with Beginner (0.8) but also allows for some Intermediate techniques due to the interval format and emphasis on rhythm (score 0.6). The content appropriately matches the Intermediate requirement.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 31 minutes with an interval format suggests moderate effort. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 and music tempo support increased exertion at times. This aligns strongly with Moderate (0.7) effort and to some extent with Challenging (0.4), particularly for those not accustomed to sustained interval training.",
