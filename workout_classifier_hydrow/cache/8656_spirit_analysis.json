  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Power Flow' emphasizes 'flow', indicating a strong element of continuous and coordinated motion, aligning well with the Flow & Rhythm spirit. The use of music like 'Chill mid' and tracks such as 'Heartbreaker' and 'Let It Go' further enhances the flow vibe, supporting a score of 0.85.\n\nThe visual setting is outdoors on a dock, contributing to an Outdoor & Adventure spirit. Although the description doesn't explicitly mention adventure elements, the setting implies interaction with the natural environment, justifying a score of 0.75.\n\nThe 'Chill' and 'Cool/Downtempo' music genres suggest a calming effect, and the yoga-like focus on twisting and leg strengthening hints at restorative aspects. This justifies a Soothing & Restorative score of 0.6, emphasizing recovery and relaxation besides physical exertion.\n\nOther spirits, such as High-Energy & Intense or Sport & Agility, were excluded due to the absence of high-intensity indicators or sport-specific skills."
