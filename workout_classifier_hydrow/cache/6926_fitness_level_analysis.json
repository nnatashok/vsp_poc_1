  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'row' generally defaults technique difficulty to 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate' as per platform-specific rules. The description mentions 'climb in rhythm during 2-minute intervals' which indicates a structured and rhythmic rowing technique, aligning well with 'Intermediate'. However, the general nature of rowing remains accessible for beginners, suggesting a strong overlap with 'Beginner'. Thus, Beginner is given a slightly higher emphasis.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is an 11-minute interval rowing session with a max rhythm of 30, suggesting heightened exertion during run and sprint paces. Described as a 'sweat' beat type indicates increased intensity, fitting both 'Moderate' and 'Challenging' levels. Since the workout intensity level is 2 out of 3, effort is notably high making both levels applicable. 'Moderate' reflects typical row intensity, while 'Challenging' aligns with the increased exertion of intervals.",
