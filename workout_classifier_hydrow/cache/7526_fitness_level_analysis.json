This classification is supported by the workout being categorized under 'row', which typically involves straightforward, repetitive rowing movements that are low in coordination complexity. The Intermediate score of 0.5 is attributed to the interval format, which can add a slight level of complexity, though ultimately the rowing remains foundational in technique.",
