  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', restricting technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The instruction of 'climb your way up' with varying rhythms indicates a degree of complexity, suggesting intermediate difficulty. However, rowing movement remains generally straightforward, supporting a Beginner score as well. Given the Max rhythm of 28, which is moderately high, it requires some coordination, aligning more strongly with Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 11 minutes is relatively short, suggesting moderate difficulty. However, it includes high tempo music and a 'climb' format, typically more strenuous, leading to a Challenging classification. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 further supports a higher energy requirement, providing a strong case for challenging difficulty for less fit users, while maintaining a moderate rating for moderately fit individuals.",
