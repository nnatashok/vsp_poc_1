  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'row' naturally limits the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate, per platform-specific classification rules. The emphasis on technique within the workout description ('Focus in on your technique with Dani during intervals') slightly raises the complexity, but not beyond the intermediate level. The involvement of rhythm changes aligns it more with Beginner or at most Intermediate, as rowing itself is a straightforward movement. Thus, we can confidently classify as between Beginner (0.7) and Intermediate (0.4).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 11:33 minutes and workout format being 'Climb' suggest a moderate difficulty due to implied intensity from interval and rhythm changes. The intensity level indicated as 2 out of 3 aligns with a Moderate effort difficulty. While the presence of music from 'Latin, Global Hits' radio stations may contribute to a faster pace, the shorter workout length keeps extreme classifications at bay. Therefore, the effort difficulty is confidently classified as Moderate with a score of 0.8, considering the intensity of interval-based rowing can be challenging but not excessively so for beginners.",
