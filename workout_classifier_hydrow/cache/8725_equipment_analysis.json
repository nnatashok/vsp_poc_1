  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata explicitly mentions dumbbells as part of the equipment needed for the upper body focus, giving it a very high confidence score of 0.9. The mention of \"2 minutes on Hydrow\" strongly implies the use of a rowing machine, also justifying a confidence level of 0.9, as Hydrow is a known rowing machine brand. \n\nThe category \"On The Mat\" along with the workout image showing exercise being performed on a mat, suggests a mat is required, warranting a confidence score of 0.7. This indicates it is recommended for comfort and stability during the core exercises performed off the rowing machine."
