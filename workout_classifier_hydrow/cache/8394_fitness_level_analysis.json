Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of just over 11 minutes and a focus on feet and ankle alignment, the physical demands are likely light. The use of low-energy music indicates a slower pace, which, combined with the specificity of the muscle groups targeted, results in low overall energy expenditure. The yoga type and gentle focus on mobility suggest a primary classification of 'Light,' although the stretching might marginally challenge those with very low fitness, justifying a minor nod to 'Moderate.'",
