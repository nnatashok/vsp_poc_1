  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Negative Split Row', involves increasing effort and speed as time progresses, which aligns with the concept of 'The Endorphin Wave', signifying elevated energy and feel-good movement. The climbing format and rhythm max of 30 indicate a structured, steady build-up of intensity. The music genre, featuring high-energy dance and global hits, supports the Endorphin Wave vibe by contributing to an energetic atmosphere.\n\nThe 'Meditative Grind' vibe is notably present due to the focus on rowing and the challenge to maintain endurance and effort as time progresses. The duration of 11:21 minutes of continuous rowing fits well within an endurance-focused grind session that requires zoning in, characteristic of a meditative repetitive workout.\n\nOther potential vibes, like 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse', were considered but not selected due to the lack of explicit emphasis on fluidity and rhythm as primary elements, focusing instead on intensity and climbing effort."
