  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.75 due to its rowing-based format, which naturally lends itself to a repetitive and rhythm-focused experience, indicative of this vibe. The metadata mentions Mike's focus on connection and unity, emphasizing a steady and immersive workout experience. Additionally, the classic rock playlist, including artists like Bon Jovi and Simple Minds, supports a consistent, engaging grind. 'The Endorphin Wave' is also applicable with a score of 0.65 because the workout includes intervals and has a medium intensity (2 out of 3), which suggests an elevated energy level and a cardiovascular challenge. The use of popular music further adds a steady endorphin-infused flow. Other vibes were excluded due to the lack of indicators for extreme intensity, competition, or technical focus typical in those categories."
