  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Bodyweight Strength' workout takes place on Achill Island, which directly indicates an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the natural setting. The environment and location greatly influence this classification. The workout is also focused on 'strength,' implying a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, as strength training typically follows a methodical and progressive structure, focusing on form and specific exercises. The playlist consists of popular, motivational tracks like 'Heat Waves' and 'Shivers,' supporting an energetic yet disciplined workout environment.\n\nThe combination of an outdoor setting and structured strength training suggests a primary emphasis on 'Outdoor & Adventure,' with a strong secondary aspect of 'Structured & Disciplined.' Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Flow & Rhythm' were not chosen due to the lack of indicators of speed or fluid movement phrasing in the metadata."
