Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 10 minutes and 42 seconds is relatively short for a workout, and as a warm-up, it is expected to have a low energy expenditure, aligning closely with a 'Light' effort difficulty. The warm-up nature implies a gradual increase in heart rate, likely corresponding with light to moderate energy output, suitable for less fit users, but not intense enough to be deemed challenging or extreme.",
