  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty for this 5:50 minute Pilates session is primarily Light, reflecting the short duration and focus on isolation exercises with minimal equipment. Pilates generally involves controlled, low-impact exercises, aligning well with a Light effort classification (0.7). The session could pose a slight challenge due to muscle isolation work, suggesting a minimal Moderate effort component (0.3), but overall, the short duration and nature of Pilates align it to be mostly Light.",
