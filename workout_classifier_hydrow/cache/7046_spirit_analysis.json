  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit due to its emphasis on \"feeling the rhythm\" with a steady pace, specifically mentioned in both the title and description. The reference to maintaining a rhythm of \"22\" suggests an emphasis on smooth, continuous movement, aligning with the Flow & Rhythm spirit (score: 0.8).\n\n\"Soothing & Restorative\" is also relevant given the workout type is a \"cool down,\" which naturally focuses on recovery and relaxation. The calming playlist of Ray Lamontagne songs and the overall intention to close one's eyes and immerse in rhythm reinforce this spirit (score: 0.7).\n\nThe outdoor rowing setting in the image suggests an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" aspect as well, leveraging the environment of the water for a calming experience, although this is less pronounced due to the inner focus of the activity (score: 0.6)."
