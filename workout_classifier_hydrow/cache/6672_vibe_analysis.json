  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Sunset Row' features a steady rowing session, which aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' due to the repetitive and endurance-based nature of rowing. The use of phrases like 'maintain lower rhythms' and 'breathe' further supports this vibe, suggesting a focused yet calming experience. Scored 0.7 as it's a core fit.\n\nThe 'Zen Flow' aspect is present, albeit to a lesser extent, due to the environment described\u2014'chase the sunset' and 'lush marshes of Essex'\u2014which provides a calming and grounding setting. This vibe was given a score of 0.4 as the primary focus appears more on rhythm and endurance rather than relaxation.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of 'Indie Alternative, Global Hits' music and the scenic context could contribute to 'The Endorphin Wave' by elevating energy and mood, warranting a score of 0.5. Overall, the session's low intensity and scenic environment primarily root the vibe in meditative and flow states."
