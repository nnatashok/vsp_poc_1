  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' primarily because it is conducted outside in a scenic environment in Siena, as seen in the image. This aligns with the spirit of leveraging the outdoor setting, giving it a score of 0.85. \n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also applicable due to the workout's focus on whole-body strength, which typically involves methodical and structured routines. The workout is described as \"whole body\" and \"approachable,\" implying some level of organization and planning, assigning it a score of 0.75. \n\n'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Flow & Rhythm,' 'Soothing & Restorative,' and 'Sport & Agility' are not fitting due to the absence of indicators of intense pacing, continuous movement, recovery focus, or sports-specific skills."
