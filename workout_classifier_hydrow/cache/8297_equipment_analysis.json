  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled 'False Creek Stern View' and is categorized as a 'row' and 'journey', which strongly implies the need for a rowing machine. The category 'row' dictates a very high confidence of 0.9 because a rowing machine would be central to performing a rowing workout. The workout appears to simulate rowing virtually through False Creek, suggesting the use of indoor rowing equipment to mimic the rowing experience. Although no equipment is explicitly listed in the provided metadata, the contextually implied requirement for a rowing machine based on the workout type and category justifies the high confidence rating."
