  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'The Firestarter' due to its high-intensity intervals, short duration, and dance-oriented music background. The metadata mentions 'HIIT' and 'high intensities' specifically, indicating fast, explosive elements typical of The Firestarter vibe. The use of 'Dance high, Global Hits' and artists like Marshmello and Halsey suggests a dynamic musical environment pushing rapid effort bursts, justifying a strong score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Competitor' vibe fits due to the structured intervals (30-second, 45-second, and 1-minute) and high intensity, aspects common in competitive-style workouts that challenge participants. Although there is no explicit mention of a leaderboard, the format suggests a competitive edge, scoring it 0.75.\n\nThe category also includes rowing, typically implying 'The Meditative Grind'; however, the interval format and high intensity shift this workout outside the zone of repetition focus, so it was excluded."
