  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Advanced HIIT Row' indicates a high-intensity interval training session, aligning closely with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe, which is characterized by sweat-dripping, heart-pounding activity. The inclusion of a max rhythm of 32 and the workout description emphasizing 'maximum effort' further strengthen this association. The use of a pop and global hits playlist featuring female artists suggests an energetic and motivating atmosphere consistent with 'The Nightclub Workout.' This vibe is evident from songs like 'Untouched' by The Veronicas and 'Hips Don't Lie' by Shakira, contributing to an upbeat, club-like experience. Furthermore, the duration of just over 21 minutes with an intensity level of 3 out of 3 implies an invigorating and endorphin-releasing experience, matching with 'The Endorphin Wave.' Overall, the combination of HIIT structure, motivating music, and maximal rhythm effort provides a strong match with these vibes."
