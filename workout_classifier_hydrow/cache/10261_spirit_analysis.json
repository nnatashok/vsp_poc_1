  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as High-Energy & Intense due to explicit indicators such as 'max effort,' 'varying rhythms,' and Dani's reputation for delivering high-energy sessions. The high intensity level (3 out of 3) and use of terms like 'drive' and 'climb' support this classification, giving a confidence score of 0.9. Flow & Rhythm spirit is also present, as the workout emphasizes maintaining rhythm at a maximum of 32 strokes per minute, with the use of music radio stations like Dance high and Global Hits to drive pacing and coordination, warranting a score of 0.7. Structured & Disciplined is significant because of the meticulous approach implied in a 'weekly race piece' format, focusing on technical precision and consistency in effort, giving it a score of 0.8. Other spirits like Soothing & Restorative and Outdoor & Adventure are excluded due to the lack of recovery focus or outdoor context."
