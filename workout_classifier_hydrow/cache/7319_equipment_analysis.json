  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly categorized under 'row,' which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the term 'Cardio Cruise Row' in the workout name reinforces the need for a rowing machine. The description's focus on building cardio at a low intensity further supports this inference. The image provided shows a person rowing, suggesting that a rowing machine is central to the workout. Overall, the metadata consistently points to the use of a rowing machine, which justifies a very high confidence level of 1."
