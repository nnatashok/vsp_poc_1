  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Core Burn Circuit' workout, featuring a Marine veteran and CrossFit coach, suggests a high-energy and intense vibe, aligning with 'The Warrior Workout'. The descriptors 'fast-paced' and 'spicy' in the instructor's style imply a challenging and invigorating session, thus justifying a 0.75 score. The EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute) format is typical of high-intensity circuits, supporting 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe with a score of 0.65 due to the expected intensity and potential unpredictability.\n\nAdditionally, the music playlist, filled with Latin and Global Hits tracks, provides a strong rhythmic element, which contributes to 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe to some extent, scored 0.60. The upbeat, infectious rhythms characteristic of the songs suggest a workout that's both intense and music-driven. Though the specific categorization between these vibes is high, there is no explicit mention of competitive or performance-focused elements, which excludes vibes like 'The Competitor' or 'The Tactical Athlete' despite the military background of the coach. The lack of details on journey-based or meditative elements excludes 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Zen Flow'."
