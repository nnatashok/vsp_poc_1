  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.9. This is due to the location along the Charles River, which is explicitly mentioned in the description, indicating a nature-based rowing setting. The setting itself plays a significant role in defining the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. \n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also applicable, scored at 0.8, as the workout is a cool-down session. Key phrases like 'Gradually bring your rhythm and heart rate down' suggest a focus on recovery and relaxation, common in restorative workouts.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' receives a score of 0.5. The maximum rhythm of 24 and the context of being guided by music such as Latin and Global Hits suggest some engagement with musical flow, but it is not the primary focus compared to the relaxation and environment aspects.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded given the clear emphasis on winding down and the absence of intense or athletic training markers."
