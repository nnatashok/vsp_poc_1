  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled '90s Music Row' and accompanied by a playlist full of rhythmic and nostalgic 90s songs, suggesting a focus on 'Flow & Rhythm.' The description mentions jamming to these tunes, emphasizing the integration of music-driven pacing and coordination (score: 0.75). The session takes place on a river, as evidenced by the image, aligning it with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, leveraging the natural environment and exploratory elements (score: 0.7). The format is steady and the intensity is low, matching the 'breathe' category. This indicates some emphasis on relaxation and recovery, fitting the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, though less prominently than the others (score: 0.5). The methodical steady pace also excludes 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits. Overall, there is confidence in the identified spirits due to strong musical and environmental cues."
