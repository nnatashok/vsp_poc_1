  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Hype HIIT Row,' which strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the category includes the term 'row,' which confirms rowing as the central activity. The description highlights 'sprint through short intervals along the Charles River' which emphasizes a rowing-based HIIT workout. The image further supports this by showing individuals rowing. Given the explicit indicators of rowing, a 'Rowing machine' is required with very high confidence (1.0). No other equipment is mentioned or implied."
