  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Endurance Builder Row' primarily aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its focus on endurance building through intervals, which suggests a zone-in and repetitive approach (score: 0.8). The description mentions 'Hold steady with James' and 'standard,row' categories indicating a sustained, rhythmic effort that resonates with the meditative aspect.\n\nAdditionally, the workout fits 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe with a score of 0.6 due to its steady energy flow supported by a classic rock playlist. Rock music helps to elevate energy without immediate intensity spikes, aligning with a feel-good, building-progress vibe.\n\nThe intensity level is 1 out of 3, which supports a lower, more sustainable intensity, ruling out more explosive vibes like 'The Firestarter' or 'The Warrior Workout.' The duration and interval format reinforce the endurance and rhythmic nature of this workout."
