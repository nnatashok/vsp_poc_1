  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which requires a 'Rowing machine' with very high confidence. The title 'English Bay Bow View' suggests a rowing-related theme since 'bow' is a term commonly used in rowing to indicate the front part of a boat. Although the description does not explicitly mention the equipment, the metadata clearly categorizes the workout as 'row,' which strongly implies the centrality of a rowing machine to the exercise. Given the absence of other equipment mentions, the rowing machine is the only necessary equipment for this workout."
