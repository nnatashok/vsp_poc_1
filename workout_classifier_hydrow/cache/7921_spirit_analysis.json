  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Nord\u00e5svannet Bay Stern View' and described as an 'escape to the rolling hills of Norway on flat water,' which strongly indicates an Outdoor & Adventure spirit. The reference to a specific natural location and the suggestion of travel ('escape') point to a nature-based exploration. The 'journeys' category further supports this classification, aligning with the outdoor and exploratory aspects of the spirit, justifying a score of 0.95 for Outdoor & Adventure.\n\nA lesser emphasis on Flow & Rhythm is considered due to the journey aspect, which implies a continuous movement and potentially a scenic, rhythmic experience. However, the lack of explicit mention of music-driven pacing or a specific flow in the description only supports a mild match, leading to a score of 0.45.\n\nOther spirits such as High-Energy & Intense, Structured & Disciplined, and Soothing & Restorative were excluded due to the absence of language indicating intensity, structured training, or a focus on relaxation and recovery."
