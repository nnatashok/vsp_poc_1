  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Advanced Pilates' and described as a 'mat style pilates workout,' which explicitly indicates the use of a mat. The 'Category: On The Mat' also strongly suggests the necessity of a mat. The image shows a participant on a mat, confirming its use. Therefore, the confidence score for the mat is very high at 0.9. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata or image, so no additional equipment is identified."
