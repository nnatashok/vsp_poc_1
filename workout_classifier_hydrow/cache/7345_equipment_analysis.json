  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Technique Cool-Down' and the description mentions 'breaking down the rowing stroke with Mac as you row along the Charles River,' indicating a focus on rowing technique. Additionally, the category includes 'row' which implies rowing is central to the workout. These factors strongly suggest that a rowing machine is required, giving it a very high confidence score of 1.0. The image also shows rowing equipment on the water, which reinforces this analysis."
