  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is a cool-down session that includes rowing and pauses for stretching, signifying a low-intensity and recovery-focused session, which aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe. The description mentions a gradual decrease in rhythm, further supporting this classification, earning it a strong match score of 0.8. \n\n'Zen Flow' is also relevant due to the rhythmic and intentional pacing involved in the rowing and stretching, indicating a breath-centered, calming approach. This vibe is also supported by the music choice of indie and alternative tracks, which might lend a mellow atmosphere, getting a score of 0.6.\n\n'Meditative Grind' was considered due to the rowing element. Its repetitive and endurance-like aspect fits this vibe moderately well, hence a score of 0.5. The gentle nature of the cool-down coupled with the focus on rhythm could moderately imply a meditative state during the workout."
