  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily centered around balance and core alignment, suggesting a gentle, controlled pace typical of 'The Zen Flow.' This vibe is supported by the keywords 'balance' and 'on the mat,' and a chill, downtempo playlist, justifying a score of 0.75.\n\nThe music choices, like 'Walking On A Dream' and 'Be Kind,' add an expressive, fluid feeling, indicating elements of 'The Groove Session,' which gets a score of 0.6.\n\nThe short duration (11 minutes) and focus on alignment can contribute to a refreshing, restorative experience fitting 'The Reboot Workout,' scored at 0.5. This vibe is slightly less pronounced due to the emphasis on core and balance rather than deep stretching or purely restorative exercises. The overall confidence in these vibe assignments is high, based on the clear alignment-focused metadata and music genre."
