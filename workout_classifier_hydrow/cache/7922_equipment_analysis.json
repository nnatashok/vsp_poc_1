  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "Given the workout metadata, the title 'Nord\u00e5svannet Bay Stern View' and the description 'Escape to the rolling hills of Norway on flat water' suggest a rowing-focused workout. The 'row' category further solidifies this inference, indicating that the workout is part of those primarily based on rowing exercises. This is a clear indication that a rowing machine is central to the workout. Therefore, the assignment of a rowing machine with a high confidence score of 0.9 is justified. There is no mention or implication of any additional equipment being needed, aligning with typical requirements for rowing-centric workouts."
