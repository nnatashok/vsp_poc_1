  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'One Stroke at a Time Row' and the category includes 'row', both of which explicitly suggest the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the description mentions focusing on being present with each stroke, which is a specific aspect of using a rowing machine. The instructor\u2019s background as a collegiate rower further supports the likelihood that this workout is designed for a rowing machine. Therefore, the confidence level for the rowing machine is very high, at 0.9, due to these strong indicators in the title, description, and classification as a 'row' type workout."
