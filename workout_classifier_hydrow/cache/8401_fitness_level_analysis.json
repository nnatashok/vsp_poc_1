  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The Sandwich Row workout fits into the 'row' category, which restricts technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate levels according to guidelines. The incorporation of intervals and rhythm shifts increases the complexity slightly, making it more suitable for an Intermediate technique classification, but it's not overly technical to move beyond that classification. Thus, the distribution is 0.3 for Beginner and a stronger score of 0.7 for Intermediate due to the format.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 21:26 minutes long, which is substantial but not extensive. The format is 'interval' and 'sweat,' indicating moderate to high intensity. The maximum rhythm of 30 indicates some pace but not extremely rapid, while the instructor's presence suggests motivational guidance aiming to push limits slightly, aligning with a rating of 2 out of 3 on intensity. Therefore, the effort difficulty is primarily Challenging (0.6) with an element of Moderate (0.4), considering the general endurance requirement and energy expenditure involved.",
