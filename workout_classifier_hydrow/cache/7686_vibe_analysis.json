  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Pop-Up Warm-Up' is designed to quickly increase heart rate through rhythm-based intervals, suggesting an energetic vibe. The presence of popular music tracks like 'Hips Don\u2019t Lie' by Shakira and 'Higher' by Creed implies an engaging and rhythmic atmosphere, aligning well with 'The Groove Session.' This is supported by the workout being categorized as a 'warm-up,' which typically involves light, lively movement, further enhancing this vibe classification. I assigned a score of 0.7 to 'The Groove Session' due to these rhythmical and fun elements.\n\nThe workout's interval structure and energetic playlist also suggest a gradual buildup of energy, resonating with 'The Endorphin Wave.' This vibe captures the steady and feel-good nature of the workout. A score of 0.5 is given due to the continuous, moderate-intensity movement indicative of a warm-up, though it lacks the full impact of a sustained endurance session. Overall, the combination of music and workout format supports these classifications."
