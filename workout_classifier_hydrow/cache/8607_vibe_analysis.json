  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe of 'Classical Pilates' is predominantly 'The Masterclass Workout', as indicated by the focus on classical pilates and the expertise of the instructor, Christie, who is described as a pilates expert. This suggests a technique-driven and skill-building session, aligning strongly with 'The Masterclass Workout'. The confidence level is high given the explicit mention of classical training and expertise, so a score of 0.9 is appropriate. Additionally, the music playlist features energetic remixes and dance hits, which lends a secondary vibe of 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse'. This beat-driven music environment suggests a strong, fluid session influenced by music, warranting a score of 0.7. There is minimal evidence for other vibes, as the workout doesn't imply extreme intensity, competitive elements, or a meditative focus."
