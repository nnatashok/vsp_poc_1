  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Shoulder Opening Align' with Owen focuses on yoga-based movements, suggesting a calm and intentional pace, which aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The description emphasizes 'opening and strengthening through your shoulders,' using yoga blocks, indicative of grounding and breath-centered techniques typical of 'The Zen Flow.' With a music selection featuring chill, cool, and downtempo tracks (e.g., 'Hymnals' by Grizfolk and 'Be Kind' by Marshmello, Halsey), the experience is likely smooth and unhurried, further supporting this vibe with a high confidence of 0.8. Additionally, the workout's focus on 'aligning' and shoulder opening also fits 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which emphasizes total-body refreshment and deep stretching. The moderate workout duration suggests a more focused session rather than a high-intensity effort, justifying its placement under 'The Reboot Workout' with a score of 0.6."
