The 'Drive' type suggests potentially advanced engagement, creating slight complexity. However, all rowing activities, per guidelines, are capped at Beginner to Intermediate for technique.",

Although short, the intense format suggests Challenging effort with possible Extreme elements for those less fit, given the pace and exertion emphasis in the workout.",
