  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Control Your Legs Row' exhibits strong elements of both 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Flow & Rhythm' spirits. The image shows a rowing session recorded on a natural water body, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The emphasis on 'holding a consistent pace' and 'generating power from your legs' suggests a focus on rhythm and coordinated movement, indicative of the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The music playlist, featuring dance and global hits, supports a rhythmic engagement. The workout's intensity is moderate (level 1 out of 3), reinforcing a smooth, flowing experience rather than a high-intensity session, which aligns less with 'High-Energy & Intense.' Thus, 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Flow & Rhythm' are the most fitting spirits for this workout."
