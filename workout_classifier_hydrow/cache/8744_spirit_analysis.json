  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's name and description, 'HIIT Row' and 'Give it all you've got for 15 strokes at the top of every minute,' point to a highly intense and energetic session, characteristic of a \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit. The use of the term HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) and a maximum rhythm of 32 support this categorization, leading to a strong match score of 1.0.\n\nThe setting, as indicated by the image of rowing on a river, suggests elements of the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. The environmental factor of being outdoors in nature contributes to a score of 0.7.\n\nThe music genre includes 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits,' which may also contribute to maintaining high energy but does not detract from the high-intensity classification. Therefore, the primary spirit is High-Energy & Intense, with a secondary influence of Outdoor & Adventure."
