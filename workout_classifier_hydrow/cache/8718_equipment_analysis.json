  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Instructional: Hip Pivot with Shoulder Positioning' and is described as focusing on proper hip movement and angles specifically for rowers. This, along with the 'row' category tag and the image showing a person using a rowing machine, confirms with very high confidence (1.0) that a rowing machine is required. The emphasis on training new and veteran rowers further supports the necessity of a rowing machine in this workout."
