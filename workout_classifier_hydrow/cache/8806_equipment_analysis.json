  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title \"Consistent Effort Row\" and the 'row' category in the metadata strongly indicate that a rowing machine is essential for this workout. The description mentions maintaining a consistent power level, which is a common focus in rowing exercises. Additionally, the fact that the workout is categorized under 'sweat' and involves format 'Power' aligns well with the use of a rowing machine for effective cardio and power-based workouts. \n\nGiven these explicit references, the confidence score for including a rowing machine as necessary equipment is set at 1.0, as it is highly unlikely that the workout can be completed as intended without this equipment. No other equipment is indicated or implied in the metadata, suggesting that the rowing machine is the sole required equipment."
