  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'Row', which restricts the Technique Difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. Given the workout's focus on 'low rhythms' and its description of utilizing 'drive through your legs', these are basic rowing strokes that do not require complex coordination. Furthermore, the presence of intervals suggests a structured format, but still beginner-friendly given the context of 'low rhythms.' Thus, technique difficulty aligns strongly with a Beginner level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 21 minutes and 'low rhythm' focus suggest moderate energy demands, fitting between Light and Moderate effort. The workout intensity is rated 1 out of 3, indicating it's not overly taxing but involves more than minimal exertion, reflecting slightly higher energy expenditure than pure Beginner workouts. Interval training typically involves bursts of activity alternating with rest, hence moderately challenging but with an essence of Light effort due to controlled pacing.",
