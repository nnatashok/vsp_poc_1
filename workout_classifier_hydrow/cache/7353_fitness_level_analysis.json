  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The metadata categorizes this workout as a row workout ('category: Breathe, standard, row'), which typically implies lower technique difficulty. The data notes the Workout Type is 'breathe', and the workout includes controlling rhythm to maintain intensity, suggesting some coordinated effort. While this indicates a slightly higher complexity, it's not enough to exceed beginner-level criteria; therefore, beginner-level aligns exceedingly well, with some slight overlap into intermediate due to the rhythm components.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short at 11:22 and is rated at an intensity level of 1 out of 3. The format is interval, which can increase effort slightly due to bursts of activity, yet it's designed for a 'breathe' workout, suggesting reduced intensity overall. The workout is suitable for deconditioned users at a light effort level, with a slightly higher effort due to intermittent bursts.",
