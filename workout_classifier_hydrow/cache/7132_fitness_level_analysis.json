  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as a rowing exercise and falls under the 'row' category. According to the Hydrow-specific rules, technique difficulty for rowing workouts can only be either Beginner or Intermediate levels. Given the beginner-friendly User Fitness Level Requirement and the focus on building endurance with standard rowing intervals, the movements are straightforward with minimal complexity. Hence, a 'Beginner' classification with very high confidence is appropriate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity level is rated 1 out of 3, indicating a relatively low-intensity session. However, the 31-minute duration with 4-minute and 30-second intervals suggests consistent effort over a significant period, elevating the effort level beyond 'Light'. Thus, it aligns well with a 'Moderate' effort difficulty classification, suitable for individuals building stamina and cardio, which is slightly challenging for deconditioned users.",
