  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to several factors. The description explicitly mentions 'high intensity intervals,' and the workout intensity level is 3 out of 3, indicating a maximum effort session. Additionally, the format is labeled as HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training), further reinforcing the intense nature of this workout. The music playlist also includes high-energy tracks from artists like Dua Lipa and Calvin Harris, supporting this classification.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also applicable, as the workout is conducted \"along the banks of the Rio Guadalquivir in Seville,\" emphasizing the natural outdoor setting. The rowing activity on a river aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification criteria.\n\nWhile these two spirits are most prominent, other spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' are less relevant due to the focus on high-intensity intervals rather than smooth continuous movement."
