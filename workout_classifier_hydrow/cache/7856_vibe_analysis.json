  "vibesExplanation": "**The Meditative Grind (0.7):** The focus on rhythm and gradual building, as highlighted in the description and supported by the 'breathe' workout type, suggests a meditative quality often found in endurance-focused rowing workouts. The pacing and structure indicate a repetitive, immersive experience. \n\n**The Endorphin Wave (0.6):** The playlist and 'climb' format, along with the comeback theme, support a vibe of steadily building energy and feel-good movement, indicative of the Endorphin Wave. The inclusion of indie and global hits also adds a positive, uplifting tone to the workout.\n\n**The Reboot Workout (0.5):** Since the workout is low intensity (1 out of 3) and falls under the 'breathe' category, it might provide a refreshing and low-stress experience, aligning with elements of a Reboot Workout. The title 'Comeback Row' also suggests a rejuvenative angle, potentially focusing on recovery or mental rejuvenation. \n\nThe vibe selection draws from the themes of rhythmic progression, gradual energy build, and a low-stress environment, while excluding more intense or technique-driven vibes due to the specified intensity level."
