  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout type 'row' and Hydrow-specific rules, the Technique Difficulty is inherently capped at Intermediate level. The description indicates rhythm increases during the climb format, which could involve slight complexity for coordination, but overall, rowing as an exercise falls within Beginner to Intermediate difficulty. The presence of an Olympian coach may suggest higher expectations, but as the rowing itself remains technically simple, Beginner is the primary fit, with some possibility for Intermediate due to rhythm complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of over 30 minutes and includes '8-minute climbs', suggesting moderate physical exertion, primarily due to sustained periods of rowing which can be challenging for beginners. Despite being classified with an intensity of '1 out of 3', the longer duration and climbing format imply that users must maintain effort over time, fitting a Moderate classification. Light effort is also possible for complete beginners, hence both are valid.",
