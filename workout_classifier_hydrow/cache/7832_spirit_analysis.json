  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit \"Flow & Rhythm\" is clearly indicated by the workout name \"Hip-Opening Flow\" and description, emphasizing smooth movement and mind-body connection. The category \"flow\" further supports this, with a congruent playlist featuring chill music that aligns with a rhythmic, coordinated session. This leads to a high confidence score of 0.9 for \"Flow & Rhythm.\"\n\nThe serene outdoor setting visible in the image, by a body of water, suggests an immersive nature experience, which aligns with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. However, since the workout is primarily on-the-mat focused, the confidence for \"Outdoor & Adventure\" is slightly lower at 0.7."
