  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified with a strong 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit mainly due to the description emphasizing 'racing to accumulate maximum meters' and the intensity level rated as 3 out of 3. These elements suggest a focus on maximum effort and pushing limits. The 'Power' format and a playlist featuring energetic genres like 'Pop Punk' and 'Global Hits' further reinforce this spirit, warranting a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also applicable due to the environmental setting depicted in the image, showing an outdoor rowing scenario. The visual environment indicates a connection with nature, which is typical of this spirit. Hence, it receives a score of 0.7. Although the metadata doesn't explicitly mention the outdoor setting, the image strongly supports this classification. \n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were less relevant due to the lack of emphasis on coordination or technical precision in the description. The workout's short duration (11 minutes) and focus on intensity rather than soothing or recovery eliminate the likelihood of 'Soothing & Restorative.'"
