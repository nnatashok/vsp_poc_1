  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Steady Cruise Row' has multiple elements aligning with specific spirits. The title 'Steady Cruise Row' and format 'Steady' suggest a rhythmic and smooth workout, fitting the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, reinforced by a consistent beat with a max rhythm of 22. The playlist, featuring mellow pop hits (e.g., Craig David's '7 Days'), supports a relaxed vibe, enhancing this classification.\n\nThe workout intensity level is marked as 1 out of 3, and the type 'breathe' belongs to the 'Breathe' and 'Standard' categories, indicating emphasis on calm, controlled breathing and a relaxed pace. This aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, though the primary focus seems to be on flow.\n\nThe image of a rower on a river further adds to the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit since the activity is conducted in a natural setting, which typically boosts exploration and environmental engagement. Given these elements, the 'Flow & Rhythm,' 'Soothing & Restorative,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits are most applicable, with high confidence."
