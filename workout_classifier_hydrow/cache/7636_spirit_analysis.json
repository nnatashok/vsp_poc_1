  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is best classified under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to the emphasis on 'sprint pace' and the workout being part of a 'sweat' category. The description explicitly mentions 'tackle 3-minute intervals,' suggesting a challenging and energetic format aligned with high-intensity training. The interval format typically involves a significant cardio component, which is further reinforced by the indication of an 'intermediate' fitness level requirement, suggesting the need for a vigorous effort at a 'rhythm 26,' a moderately high stroke rate. A score of 0.75 is assigned as the intensity level is 2 out of 3, indicating a strong match to intense characteristics.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also pertinent, noted by the clearly defined '3-minute intervals' and 'rhythm 26' specifications, indicating a methodical approach to the workout. The structured nature implies a focus on consistency and technical components associated with disciplined sessions. This spirit scores 0.6 due to the format and rhythm, which are indicative of structured planning but not as heavily emphasized as in purely disciplined training regimens. Other spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the absence of elements focused on continuous movement or relaxation."
