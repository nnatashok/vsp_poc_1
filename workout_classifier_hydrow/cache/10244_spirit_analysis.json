  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Drop Your Split: Recovery Cool-Down' is prominently focused on recovery, emphasizing a 'comfortable pace,' 'breathing,' and 'recovery' as stated in the description. The use of chill and downtempo music further supports a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, indicating a very strong match (score: 0.9) for this spirit, given its relaxing nature and cool-down purpose.\n\nAdditionally, the visual metadata shows the activity conducted on a river, which indicates an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. While the session seems to focus more on recovery than exploration or environmental challenges, the outdoor setting justifies a secondary classification with a moderate score of 0.65.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the explicit emphasis on a relaxed pace and cool-down format, which do not align with their characteristics."
