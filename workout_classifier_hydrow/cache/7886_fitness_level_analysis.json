  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is categorized as 'Drive', which according to Hydrow-specific rules, typically indicates a higher technique complexity but remains capped at Intermediate due to the row category. The 'Rage Row' session involves 60-second intervals with a high rhythm (32+), suggesting moderate complexity in maintaining proper rowing form under high intensity, leading to an Intermediate classification. However, the 'row' category limits the classification to Beginner or Intermediate, hence a strong alignment with Beginner but also considerable alignment with Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is described as high-intensity with 60-second intervals, maximum rhythm of 32+, and an intensity level marked as 3 out of 3, indicating a physically demanding workout. The duration (11:26) is relatively short but intense, typical of HIIT formats. This suggests a Challenging to Extreme effort level, as maintaining high intensity over the interval period would demand significant energy expenditure. The session's design focuses on pushing physical limits, hence the strong alignment with Challenging but considerable basis for Extreme classification as well.",
