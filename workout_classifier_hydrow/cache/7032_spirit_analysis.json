  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Climbing Intervals Row' workout has a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, evident from the image showing the workout conducted on water amid an outdoor setting. This provides a direct connection to natural elements, aligning perfectly with the spirit (score: 0.9). The description emphasizes 'climb up in rhythm,' indicating a focus on pacing and musicality, which aligns well with 'Flow & Rhythm' (score: 0.8). The term \"sweat\" and the structured interval format, particularly the emphasis on maintaining a goal split, indicate a high level of intensity, supporting the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit (score: 0.7). The use of energetic music genres like 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits' enhances this intensity feel. While there was potential for 'Structured & Disciplined' due to the interval nature, the emphasis remains more on rhythm and outdoor setting."
