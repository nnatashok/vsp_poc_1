  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is aptly classified under 'The Zen Flow' with a score of 0.8 due to its description emphasizing a 'yoga flow' that is 'approachable for all levels,' suggesting an unhurried, breath-centered approach. The combination of 'On The Mat' activities further supports the calming vibe typical of a Zen Flow.\n\nThe choice of music, with chill, downtempo tracks by artists like 'Billie Eilish' and 'Autograf,' complements a relaxed yet rhythmic environment, thus partially aligning with 'The Groove Session.' The music selection introduces an element of expressiveness and flow, earning a score of 0.6 for this vibe.\n\nThe absence of high-intensity indicators or competitive elements excludes more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.' The overall vibe confidence is high at 0.85 due to the alignment between the described flow, music, and yoga orientation."
