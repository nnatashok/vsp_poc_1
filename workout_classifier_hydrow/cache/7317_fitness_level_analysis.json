  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a relatively short duration (10:39), which suggests a lighter effort output. Resistance bands contribute to the intensity without adding the level of effort required by weights, placing it between Light and Moderate. This classification is supported by the lack of additional equipment and the standard 'on-the-mat' category.",
