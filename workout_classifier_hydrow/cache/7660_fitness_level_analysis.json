  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically involves basic to moderate rowing movements that do not require an advanced level of technique complexity. Although the session includes 2' and 1' interval rowing, the challenge is more related to maintaining pace rather than executing complex movements. As such, this aligns with Beginner to Intermediate Technique Difficulty due to the interval nature, allowing for some modest technical engagement in maintaining rhythm and form.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The Effort Difficulty is inferred from the 31:26 duration paired with interval training (2' and 1') and a maximum rhythm of 32, which suggests a more intense rowing session. The categorization as 'sweat' and an intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicates a significant physical demand, particularly in maintaining consistent effort during shorter interval bursts. Consequently, Moderate is the primary effort level, with an extension to Challenging due to potentially demanding intervals for less conditioned users.",
