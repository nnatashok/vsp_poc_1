  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workoutType 'Drive' suggests a higher technique difficulty, aligning with more complex rowing sessions, typically requiring better form and coordination. Since it's a rowing-based workout, the allowed classification is Beginner or Intermediate. The HIIT format with specified intervals indicates coordination needs beyond basic levels, thus strongly justifying an 'Intermediate' classification. Given the high rhythm and intensity descriptions, there is also evidence for higher difficulty execution but without exceeding 'Intermediate.'",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is designed using HIIT intervals (60, 45, and 30-second bursts), which inherently increase the physical demands. The maximum rhythm of 30 and intensity level graded 3 out of 3 suggest significant energy expenditure, aligning with a 'Challenging' effort level. Furthermore, the limited rest typically associated with HIIT sessions could push the boundaries of effort towards 'Extreme,' particularly for deconditioned users. Overall, the workout's duration and structure mainly fit the 'Challenging' category.",
