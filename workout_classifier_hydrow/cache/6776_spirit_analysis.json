  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as having an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit due to the image showing the session being conducted on a river. This setting directly aligns with the definition of leveraging natural environments, giving it a score of 0.8 for strong relevance. \n\nThe \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit is supported by the workout's focus on steady rowing and tuning into the technique with music that encourages a rhythmic pace, indicated by tracks from genres such as Dance and Global Hits, aligning well with mind-body connection exercises. Therefore, it receives a score of 0.7.\n\n\"Structured & Disciplined\" is also relevant here, as participants are encouraged to focus on tuning technique and conducting steady rowing, fitting well within methodical training aimed at precision. The focus on scanning the body and rowing at a target rhythm (max rhythm of 24) supports a systematic approach, giving it a score of 0.6.\n\nThe workout is lower in intensity, eliminating \"High-Energy & Intense,\" and it doesn't emphasize recovery or stress reduction, which excludes \"Soothing & Restorative.\" The absence of sports-specific training removes the \"Sport & Agility\" spirit."
