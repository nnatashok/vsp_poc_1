  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 20 minutes and focus on \"keeping your heart rate elevated\" implies a moderate to challenging intensity level. While it's not strictly categorized as high-intensity interval training, the engagement of large muscle groups such as the lower body and core, combined with guidance from an experienced instructor, points to a workout more demanding than light effort, yet manageable for less fit individuals.",
