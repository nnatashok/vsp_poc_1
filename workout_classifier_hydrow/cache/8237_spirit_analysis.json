  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as \"Flow & Rhythm\" with a high score of 0.9. This is due to the metadata indicating a \"flow\" type session that focuses on smooth, continuous movements aimed at gradually opening the hips and lower back, which aligns with the flow spirit. The mention of a chill and downtempo music genre supports this classification, enhancing the rhythmic and connected practice.\n\nThe \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit also receives a strong score of 0.7. The description suggests a gradual, gentle approach aimed at opening and presumably relaxing the hips, which fits well within a restorative category. The recommendation of yoga blocks confirms a supportive and careful practice aimed at healing and comfort.\n\n\"Outdoor & Adventure\" receives a moderate score of 0.6, based on the visual evidence indicating an outdoor setting by a body of water and a city skyline. This adds an adventurous or exploratory element to the experience, though the primary focus is still the flow itself. The outdoor aspect contributes an additional layer to the overall feel of the workout."
