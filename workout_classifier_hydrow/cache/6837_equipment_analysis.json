  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Cool Down, standard, row,' which indicates a rowing-related activity. The description highlights taking 'full strokes,' implying a rowing motion. Despite being a cool-down session focused on relaxation and reflection, the presence of 'row' in the category and description strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine. Therefore, a rowing machine is identified as the required equipment with very high confidence (0.9) due to its central role in the workout's intended movements."
