Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a cool down session, lasting only 5 minutes and 40 seconds, and involves rowing at relatively low intensities (rhythms 22 and 24). As a cool down, the energy expenditure and physical demand are minimal, aligning strongly with a Light effort difficulty. Given the brief duration and focus on relaxation and form, a score of 0.9 is appropriate for the Light level.",
