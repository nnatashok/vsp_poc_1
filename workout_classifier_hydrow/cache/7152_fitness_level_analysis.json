  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 30 minutes suggests a sustained effort, potentially escalating the physical demand for less fit users. The label of 'standard' rowing indicates a consistent cardio output, which usually falls under Moderate intensity as it is endurance-focused over a substantial period. However, the 30-minute continuous rowing aspect can make it moderately challenging for deconditioned users, thus a secondary Challenging rating might partially apply.",
