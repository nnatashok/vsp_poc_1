Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout type 'mobility' and a short duration of 10:33, the focus is on gentle stretching and mobility, suggesting a low physical demand. The goal of the workout is to 'gently open up your hips', which is indicative of exercises that are not high-intensity or energy exhaustive, placing the Effort Difficulty securely in the 'Light' category. The 'on-the-mat' category further implies a low-intensity, stationary workout typical of stretching routines.",
