  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts just over 10 minutes, with an EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute) format that promotes sustained activity, suggesting a moderate effort level at baseline. The brief duration and 2-minute rowing combined with dumbbell use make it possible for deconditioned users to complete with some challenge. While 'Challenging' aligns partly due to the instructor and rhythm's potential to push users, the overall setup can be managed by users with moderate effort.",
