  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Climbing Tahoe Row\" explicitly mentions rowing on Lake Tahoe, indicating a strong environmental and nature-based aspect, aligning with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit (score: 0.9). The description emphasizes climbing and altitude, creating a challenging, exhilarating environment.\n\nThe specified format as \"Climb\" and category \"Sweat, standard, row,\" along with a mid-intensity rock playlist, suggest a vigorous workout aimed at elevating heart rates, matching the \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit (score: 0.7). The intensity level of 2 out of 3 supports this classification as well.\n\nThe music choice and rhythm (max rhythm: 26) add a layer of flow, driven by rock beats, supporting the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit (score: 0.5). This implies a connection between movement and music, crafting an engaging rowing experience.\n\nThus, while primarily \"Outdoor & Adventure,\" the workout also embodies elements of intensity and musical flow."
