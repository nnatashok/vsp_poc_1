  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Gentle Climb Row' exhibits a strong 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit given the emphasis on rhythm in both the title and description ('climb in rhythm'). The music selection, including tracks like 'Latch' and 'Come Get It Bae,' supports a rhythmic and smooth flow, justifying a score of 0.7.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is relevant due to the low intensity level (1 out of 3) and the workout type 'breathe,' which suggests a focus on relaxation and stress reduction, earning it a score of 0.6.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is highly applicable as the workout is conducted on the Charles River, providing a natural setting, and the mention of 'cruising down the Charles River' reinforces this environmental engagement, leading to a score of 0.8.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the low intensity and absence of rigorous structure in the metadata."
