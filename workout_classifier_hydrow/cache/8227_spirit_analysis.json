  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout presents several strong indicators for different spirits. \"Flow & Rhythm\" is suggested by phrases like \"shifting in rhythm\" and the overall musical accompaniment, focusing on coordination and a continuous flow. A 0.75 score is appropriate here given the musical elements (Pop low, Global Hits) that drive the pacing. \n\n\"Structured & Disciplined\" is evident through the format \"Pyramid\" and the focus on \"endurance,\" which implies a more methodical and planned exercise routine. The fact that it is a rowing workout also aligns with structured, precision-based training. A 0.7 score reflects the pyramid format's clear structure.\n\n\"Outdoor & Adventure\" is supported by the image showing a rowing session on a river, which fits the nature-based workout setting. The score of 0.7 reflects this strong visual element. \n\nThe low intensity (1 out of 3) and the \"breathe\" category suggest this is not primarily high-energy or intense, aligning more with the prescribed spirits."
