  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout emphasizes high intensity, as indicated by the maximum pace and intensity level 3 out of 3. The description mentions \"rev your engine\" and focuses on maintaining high rhythms of 28-32, aligning well with 'High-Energy & Intense' (score: 0.9). \n\nThe image of rowing on a river strongly suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.7), as the natural setting is a perfect fit for this classification. \n\nThe music choices, particularly songs like 'Heartlines (Mount Remix)' and the inclusion of 'Dance high, Global Hits,' support a 'Flow & Rhythm' classification due to their rhythmic drive, which can enhance pacing and coordination in workouts (score: 0.6). \n\nOther spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the focus on high energy and outdoor elements, which aren't aligned with gentleness or highly structured formats."
