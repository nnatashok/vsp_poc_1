  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's category includes 'row,' which strongly indicates that a rowing machine is required. Additionally, the image associated with the metadata shows a person rowing, further supporting the identification of a rowing machine as necessary equipment. Given the absence of any other mentioned equipment and the focus on maintaining rhythm during a 'jog pace,' which is consistent with rowing on a machine, a very high confidence level is assigned to the rowing machine requirement."
