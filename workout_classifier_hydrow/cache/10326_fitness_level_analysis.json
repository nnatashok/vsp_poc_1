  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The circuit format typically implies a moderate to challenging effort level. The 20-minute duration, combination of strength exercises with dumbbells, and cardio bursts on the Hydrow indicate a Moderate energy expenditure. The mention of \"strength and endurance\" along with high rhythm implies significant engagement, justifying a Moderate (0.6) to Challenging (0.5) classification, supported by the short duration relative to total workout diversity.",
