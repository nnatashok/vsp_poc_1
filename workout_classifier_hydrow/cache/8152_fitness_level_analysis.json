Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts approximately 15 minutes, which indicates low energy expenditure relative to longer workouts. The focus on a river journey suggests a more relaxed pace, consistent with 'Light' effort difficulty. 'Moderate' effort difficulty is mildly supported due to the continuous rowing motion over the session duration. Thus, scores are 0.8 for Light and 0.4 for Moderate.",
