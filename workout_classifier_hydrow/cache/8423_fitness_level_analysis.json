The description notes the inclusion of a warm-up, high-intensity intervals ('Sweat intensity'), and a cooldown phase, supporting an Intermediate classification due to the coordination and understanding of pacing required for higher-intensity intervals.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 31-minute workout includes a 20-minute interval at 'Sweat' intensity, which is the platform's designated level 2 out of 3, indicating a significant level of exertion suited to a 'Challenging' effort difficulty. However, the presence of a warm-up and cooldown potentially moderates its overall impact, suggesting Moderate to Challenging effort for those with low fitness levels.",
