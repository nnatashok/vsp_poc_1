  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily about building lower body strength using a mini band, which suggests a focus on technique and skill building typical of 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe. This is reinforced by the metadata indicating a strength categorization and use of specific equipment, justifying a score of 0.7. The moderate length and strength focus also align with 'The Disciplined Grind,' emphasizing execution and no distractions, scoring 0.6. Additionally, the use of repetitive movements with bands can lead to a rhythm or meditative state, fitting 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.5. The playlist featuring upbeat pop songs suggests a structured, energizing session. Lack of specific intensity indicators and instructor guidance add some ambiguity but align with a consistent, disciplined effort."
