  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row' and 'drive', indicating a strong emphasis on rowing, which implies the use of a 'Rowing machine' with a very high confidence (0.9). The title 'Drive + 5 Min HIIT Combo' and the description mentioning 'five minutes of core work on your mat' explicitly specify the use of a 'Mat', providing a very high confidence score (0.8) for this equipment. The combination of high-intensity intervals and core work aligns with the need for these pieces of equipment, as observed in the provided image, which shows both the rowing machine and a mat being used."
