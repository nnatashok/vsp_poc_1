  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout falls under the category 'Drive', it automatically assumes a higher technical difficulty due to its advanced rowing technique requirements. The description highlights 'max pace' intervals and the expertise of a Paralympic medalist, indicating sophisticated rowing techniques and instruction. Thus, despite being a rowing workout generally classified under Beginner to Intermediate, it aligns with an Advanced categorization. Intermediate is also applicable due to row-type format, however, with less confidence.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 'max pace' intervals of 7 minutes each suggest a high energy expenditure and intense physical demand, fitting a 'Challenging' level. The interval structure and the highest intensity level of 3, along with the a 32-minute duration, justify potential consideration for an 'Extreme' rating, yet musically driven and upbeat environment may make it more accessible to users, fitting more comfortably in 'Challenging'.",
