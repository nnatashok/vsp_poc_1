  "vibesExplanation": "This rowing workout, titled 'Resilient Teammate Row,' emphasizes resilience, teamwork, and technical rowing along the scenic Newport Beach, guided by an enthusiastic Paralympic medalist, Dani Hansen. \"The Meditative Grind\" is selected due to the intermediate level and rowing format, where rhythm plays a key role in zoning into the workout (score: 0.7). The use of intervals suggests a smooth but persistent effort, aligning well with this vibe. \"The Endorphin Wave\" fits due to the 'feel-good, high-energy' nature described in the workout details, alongside the positive and inspiring coaching style of Dani, enhanced by Pop Punk and Global Hits radio stations, fostering elevated energy (score: 0.7). Finally, \"The Progression Quest\" is relevant as the workout involves in-depth technical detail and systematic interval training, beneficial for incremental improvement, especially in a repetitive rowing format (score: 0.6). The absence of high-intensity indicators and the focus on consistent rhythm and enjoyable mood help exclude vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Firestarter.\" The vibe classification confidence is set at 0.75 given the detailed metadata and absence of explicit music genres."
