  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Travel Mobility,\" indicating a focus on gentle, restorative movement suitable for recovery after traveling. The description emphasizes mobilization, which is aligned with a Soothing & Restorative spirit, evidenced by the gentle, healing-focused session designed to release tension. The location by a waterfront, as seen in the image, strongly suggests an Outdoor & Adventure spirit, as the natural setting adds an exploratory and environmental aspect to the session. The music playlist, featuring tracks like \"The Nomad\" and \"So Easy,\" further supports a relaxing and immersive ambiance. Hence, the combination of outdoor setting and restorative intent leads to a high confidence classification of both Outdoor & Adventure and Soothing & Restorative spirits."
