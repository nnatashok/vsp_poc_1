  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short-duration warm-up (5:43 minutes), which typically implies low intensity, designed to get the body ready rather than be a full workout. The mention of alternating between running and walking suggests a Light effort difficulty, fit for beginners, with slight potential for Moderate fit due to the presence of running. Overall, the effort required is clearly targeted towards warming up, consistent with low energy expenditure.",
