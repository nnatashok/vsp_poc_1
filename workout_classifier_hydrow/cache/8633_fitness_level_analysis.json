  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The moderate duration of 46:14 suggests a longer workout session, which would generally require sustained effort, aligning with Moderate difficulty. The nature of 'journey' indicates a consistent rowing pace, which can be somewhat demanding over time for deconditioned users. Without specific intensity markers, it's primarily moderate, with elements of challenge due to its length. This embodies a light cardio workout, elevated by the duration to a potential challenge for those in poorer physical condition.",
