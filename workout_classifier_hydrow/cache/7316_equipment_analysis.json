  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Watts + Power Row,' and the description emphasizes establishing power at lower rhythms. Since the category includes 'row' and the workout type 'sweat' typically involves cardio equipment, a rowing machine is highly likely required. The focus on 'watts' and 'interval' format further suggests the use of a rowing machine, as these are common aspects of rowing workouts. Therefore, a very high confidence score of 1.0 is assigned for the rowing machine. The image also features a rower, reinforcing the need for this equipment."
