  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Mood Boosting Row' is classified primarily under 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe with a perfect score of 1.0 due to the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format combined with upbeat 80's and Global Hits music. The playlist features motivational and feel-good songs like 'I Want You Back' and 'Walking On Sunshine', which support the endorphin-boosting effect. Additionally, the workout's description emphasizes a positive and team-oriented atmosphere, aligning with typical characteristics of an elevating and energy-building session. \nThe second vibe, 'The Meditative Grind', receives a score of 0.6 as rowing often involves repetitive motion and endurance. Although this workout is more intense and less meditative, rowing as an activity can foster a state of rhythmic concentration, particularly with the steady 32-stroke maximum rhythm outlined. The score here is moderate due to the balance of intensity with the repetitive nature implicit in rowing.\nOther potential vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' were considered but the music choice and emphasis on positivity and team spirit shifted the classification towards 'The Endorphin Wave'."
