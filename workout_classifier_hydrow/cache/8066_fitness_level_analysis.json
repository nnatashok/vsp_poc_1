  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which limits the Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The workout involves rhythmic climbing, which requires adjusting pressure and maintaining rhythm at a maximum of 28 strokes per minute. While these do require some skill, they are typical for rowing workouts and not overly complex, hence why both Beginner and Intermediate scores are valid.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 11:27 minutes and 'climb' format suggests some moderate endurance demands. It is explicitly rated as intensity level 2 out of 3, indicating it is aimed at users with some fitness experience, thus aligning with moderate effort difficulty. The need to apply varying pressure adds a challenging aspect, but the overall intensity likely leans more towards moderate, making both Moderate and Challenging levels applicable.",
