  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout focuses on 'The Hundred,' a classical Pilates mat exercise, indicating a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit as it involves coordinated movement and mind-body connection typical of Pilates. The presence of dance and global hits music further supports rhythmic flow (confidence: 0.7). Additionally, the workout is conducted outdoors in Long Beach, California, with natural scenery visible, suggesting an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Despite being short, the setting provides an exploratory atmosphere (confidence: 0.6). The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit could also apply due to Pilates' precise nature, but it's not the primary focus here."
