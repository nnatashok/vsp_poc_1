  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive,' which in Hydrow terminology indicates it requires more advanced rowing techniques, suggesting an Intermediate level. The description also mentions 'high-intensity intervals,' which demand proper form and rhythm coordination, further justifying the Intermediate classification. Although it's not highly technical, executing it effectively still demands some coordination and skill.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with a max rhythm of 34, indicating significant physical demand. Combined with the workout's duration of over 30 minutes and an intensity level of 3 out of 3, it points towards being very taxing, thus landing between Challenging and Extreme effort difficulty levels. However, considering a user base that might be out of shape, it is safely classified primarily under Challenging, with a nod towards Extreme due to high tempo and sustained engagement.",
