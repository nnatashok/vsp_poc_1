  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Legs + Core Row' and the category 'row' both explicitly suggest that a rowing machine is required. The mention of 'legs-only progressions' indicates exercises typically performed on a rowing machine focusing on certain techniques. The row-specific metadata and the fact that 'row' is a part of the workout category further supports this classification, leading to a very high confidence score for the rowing machine. The lack of any additional equipment mentioned in the metadata suggests that the rowing machine is central to this workout."
