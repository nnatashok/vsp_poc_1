  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Vancouver HIIT Row' and is categorized under 'row', indicating a rowing session. The mention of 'HIIT' and 'max rhythm: 32' suggest intervals typically done on a rowing machine. The description mentions 'building in duration', a process often experienced on a rowing machine. The image of an athlete actively rowing further supports the inference that a rowing machine is necessary. Given these factors, the confidence for requiring a rowing machine is very high, at 1.0."
