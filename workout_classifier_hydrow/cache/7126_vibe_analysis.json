  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Mind + Body Warm-Up' features a short duration of 5 minutes 45 seconds with a focus on warming up, which fits the vibe of 'The Nightclub Workout' due to its use of dance and global hits music genres, including a club remix of a popular song, indicating an energetic and rhythmic experience (score 0.65). The 'Meditative Grind' vibe is also relevant given the name and description that suggest a focus on mind-body connection and the rowing format, which is typically repetitive and endurance-based, though it slightly diverges from the traditional meditative pace due to the higher rhythm bursts (score 0.5). The overall score reflects moderate confidence in these vibes, with elements supporting both energetic and meditative experiences."
