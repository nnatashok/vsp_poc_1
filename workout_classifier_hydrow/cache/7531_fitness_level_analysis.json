  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive' and category is 'row', which typically narrow the Technique Difficulty classification to either Beginner or Intermediate due to the nature of rowing. However, given the description focuses on high-intensity efforts and the max rhythm of 30 strokes per minute, it suggests a more nuanced understanding of rowing techniques, therefore it is classified at the Intermediate level rather than Beginner.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes three 5-minute max pace intervals in a 22-minute session, labeled with an intensity level of 3 out of 3. This indicates a high energy expenditure similar to high-intensity training. While the intervals make it slightly more manageable than constant extreme effort, the session's structure and intensity suggest a Challenging effort difficulty suitable for moderately fit individuals and an Extreme difficulty suggestion for casual users.",
