  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Club 30 Row' and the description mentions performing high-intensity intervals ('crush 30 and 60-second high-intensity intervals') explicitly on a 'row'. Additionally, the category includes 'row', making it clear that a rowing machine is central to this workout. The confidence level is very high (1.0) for the requirement of a rowing machine. Other equipment is not mentioned or implied in the metadata, hence only the rowing machine is listed as necessary."
