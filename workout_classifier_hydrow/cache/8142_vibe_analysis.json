  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Pressure Pyramid Warm-Up' is designed as a warm-up session, with a steady rhythm of 20 strokes per minute which aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. This vibe focuses on repetition and steady pacing, making it a strong match with a score of 0.7. The use of pop music ('Love Shack' by The B-52's) adds a feel-good element, reminiscent of 'The Endorphin Wave', a vibe centered around elevated energy and enjoyment, scoring 0.6. The short duration and steady format also align with 'The Reboot Workout,' which is about low-stress, refreshing movement; thus, it receives a score of 0.5. Lack of intense elements or high variation rules out more vigorous or exploratory vibes."
