  "vibesExplanation": "The workout \"Power + Speed Row\" predominantly fits \"The Meditative Grind\" vibe due to its repetitive interval structure focusing on power and speed, which aligns with the aspects of zoning in and locking down, particularly under a moderate intensity level (1 out of 3). The rhythmic nature of rowing with a focus on stroke intervals and maintaining a max rhythm of 26 also introduces \"The Rhythmic Powerhouse\" vibe, which emphasizes beat-driven and fluid motions, reflected in the interval format and music choice. The incorporation of Indie Alternative and Global Hits further supports a rhythmic and strong vibe. Lastly, \"The Endorphin Wave\" is included as the steady pace and endurance focus can lead to a feel-good build of energy throughout the workout. The focus on breathing and rowing durations adds to this elevation in energy. The overall confidence in these classifications is high, given the specific emphasis on power, rhythm, and breath in the workout metadata provided."
