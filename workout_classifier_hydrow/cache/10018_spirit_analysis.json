  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Lower Body with Mini-Band Circuit', focusing on bodyweight exercises with a mini-band. This indicates a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.8, as it involves a circuit format, which is methodical and progressive. The mention of a max rhythm of 26 suggests an underlying musical component, influencing the choice of 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.6. The music elements ('80's, Global Hits') further support this spirit by implying a rhythmic component, although it's secondary to the circuit format. The workout takes place 'on the mat' and in a controlled environment, which aligns with the structured approach rather than adventure or high intensity. There's moderate confidence in this assessment, with clear evidence for 'Structured & Disciplined' and reasonable indications for 'Flow & Rhythm.'"
