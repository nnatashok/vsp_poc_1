The use of intervals at max rhythm 32 and categorized under 'Sweat' indicates a level of endurance and repetitive movement, making \"The Meditative Grind\" a strong match (score: 0.75). The pop music genre and songs like 'Love Shack' and 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' add a playful and rhythmic element, supporting \"The Groove Session\" (score: 0.7). The workout's focus on sustaining energy through intervals with enjoyable music aligns with \"The Endorphin Wave\" (score: 0.6), providing a feel-good and steady build experience. The holiday theme adds a layer of light-heartedness and community, reinforcing these vibes, yet, specific strength or explosive intensity indicated in other vibes is missing."
