  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Steady Cool-Down' with a duration of under 6 minutes is fundamentally aimed at decreasing heart rate, as per the description. The term 'cool down' and 'steady' are indicative of a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, and the inclusion of music genres like Indie Alternative adds to a calming atmosphere, justifying a score of 0.9. The presence of a '22 rhythm' and playlist details suggest a smooth continuity that aligns with 'Flow & Rhythm', warranting a score of 0.7. The image depicts the session occurring on water, which places it in an outdoor setting, indicative of an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, granted a score of 0.8. Other potential spirits were excluded due to the explicit focus on recovery and rhythm rather than intensity or structured training."
