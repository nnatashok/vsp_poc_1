  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'Drive' and 'Row', which according to Hydrow's guidelines implies at least Intermediate level. Given the workout type, 'Drive', and the category 'standard,row', this aligns with the 'Intermediate' technique level due to its emphasis on consistent rowing form. The high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format requires a level of rhythm and coordination which is typical of Intermediate, but not Advanced, rowing. The metadata also does not mention any exercises outside of rowing that would increase complexity beyond Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 11:11 and format of 1-minute intervals ('HIIT') suggest high energy expenditure over a relatively short period, indicative of significant effort. The intensity level is rated 3 out of 3, which suggests substantial exertion, aligning with the 'Challenging' to 'Extreme' levels. The max rhythm of 32 strokes per minute in rowing is also physically demanding. However, since the workout is under 15 minutes and in short intervals, it suggests the higher end of 'Challenging' rather than purely 'Extreme'.",
