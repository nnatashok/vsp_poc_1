  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Transitions Down Row' workout is categorized under 'Drive', which typically involves systematic and regimented rowing techniques. For rowing workouts, the technique difficulty is usually rated as Beginner or Intermediate. Despite the 'Drive' categorization, which suggests an advanced structured path, rowing itself remains within the Intermediate difficulty due to consistent repetitive rowing motions. Hence, this workout is rated as Intermediate for technique due to its complexity in rhythm transitions, but still accessible for developing skills.",
