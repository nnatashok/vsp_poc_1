  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Lake Las Vegas Stern View,\" and the description highlights rowing on Lake Las Vegas with mountain vistas in Nevada. This strongly suggests an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit due to the emphasis on the natural environment and the outdoor setting. The use of terms like 'lake', 'mountain views', and the indication that it involves rowing in nature align with activities that are typically classified within this spirit. Furthermore, since the workout type is listed as 'journey' and categorized under 'Journeys', it reinforces the exploration and nature-based aspect of the workout. The high score of 0.9 is assigned because the workout description and context clearly place it within the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" category. Other spirits were considered, but none matched the evident focus on the natural, exploratory, and outdoor experience."
