  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Yoga Flow' suggests a slow, intentional practice typical of a 'Zen Flow' vibe. The description 'Gently move your body' emphasizes a relaxed, breath-centered approach, aligning with 'Zen Flow.' The playlist includes chill and downtempo tracks, such as 'Sundream' by R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL and 'So Good To Me' by Chris Malinchak, enhancing the calming and grounding experience. These music choices, along with the outdoor setting in Long Beach, add to the tranquil and mindful quality, supporting a strong score of 0.8 for 'The Zen Flow.' Additionally, the use of a flowing style in the workout type and the nature of music supports a 'Groove Session' vibe, focusing on fun and expressive movement. This vibe, however, is less pronounced, resulting in a moderate score of 0.6. Other vibes were excluded due to a lack of indicators for intensity or competitiveness."
