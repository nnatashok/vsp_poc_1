Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout's length of 20:50 without mention of high-intensity elements, the effort difficulty aligns between Light and Moderate. Pilates generally involves sustained muscular engagement but without the high cardiovascular demands. The instructor's holistic approach suggests a lower intensity pacing aimed at mindfulness rather than endurance. Additionally, the absence of strenuous equipment hints at light to moderate energy expenditure.",
