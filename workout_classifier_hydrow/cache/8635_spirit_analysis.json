  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Newport Harbor Bow View' emphasizes an exploratory and nature-based experience, as it involves rowing along the shores of Newport Beach, California. The phrase 'Explore the shores' and the mention of Newport Beach highlight a connection to nature, suggesting the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, which is supported by the spatial and scenic aspect of the session. This aspect is given a strong score of 0.9 due to explicit indicators of an outdoor, exploratory journey.\n\nAdditionally, given that rowing often involves a smooth and rhythmic movement pattern and the workout type is categorized as a 'journey,' there is an element of continuous movement that aligns with 'Flow & Rhythm'. This flow-like quality is assigned a score of 0.4 due to its potential presence implied by the nature of the activity and the term 'journey', despite the lack of explicit focus on music or pacing cues.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to the absence of indications of intensity, structure, direct sports focus, or restorative goals in the metadata provided."
