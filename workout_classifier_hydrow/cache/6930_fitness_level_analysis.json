  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 10-minute duration, combined with a mostly lying-down position, suggests a workout with relatively low physical demand. The lack of equipment and Pilates' controlled nature typically require less immediate energy expenditure, supporting a Light effort categorization. The potential for engaging core muscles and maintaining poses gives it a slight edge towards Moderate difficulty, though the workout primarily aligns with Light effort demands, suitable for deconditioned users.",
