  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description explicitly mentions the use of a 'long resistance band', which is recommended for building upper body strength. This provides a very high confidence score of 1.0 for the inclusion of resistance bands. Additionally, the category 'On The Mat' strongly suggests the use of a mat for on-the-floor exercises, correlating with the image that shows a mat. This supports a high confidence score of 0.8 for a mat, as it is likely used for comfort and stability during the exercises performed on the ground. No other equipment is hinted at or visible in the metadata or image."
