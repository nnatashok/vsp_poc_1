  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's name and description emphasize foot and ankle movement and strength, suggesting a focus on recovery and gentle strengthening rather than high intensity, aligning with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The use of phrases like 'align' and 'focused yoga' also supports this classification, as these terms are associated with healing and mindful practice. The music playlist with 'chill low' and 'cool/downtempo' genres creates a calm atmosphere, further supporting a restful and soothing energy, justifying a strong score of 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nSecondly, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is relevant due to the setting overlooking the Boston Harbor, indicating an outdoor component that immerses participants in nature, earning a supporting score of 0.7. The description emphasizes the natural environment, reinforcing this spirit. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the absence of intense or athletic language in the metadata."
