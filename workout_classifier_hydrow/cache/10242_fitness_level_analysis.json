  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive', and the category includes 'row'. In Hydrow-specific rules, 'drive' implies an advanced rowing session, but since rowing exercises, in general, are either Beginner or Intermediate in technique, this aligns most closely with Intermediate. The use of steady rhythms, progressing from 26 s/m to 30 s/m, suggests moderate complexity, which fits Intermediate well. The emphasis on correct movement form and maintaining speed indicates some technique instruction, supporting intermediate classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 21 minutes long with increasing stroke rates reaching up to 30 s/m, indicating a high-intensity, cardiovascular workout that will be demanding for most deconditioned users. The 'drive' type and max rhythm at 30 s/m suggest a strenuous and continuous effort level. This intensity level is marked as 3 out of 3, which typically requires a significant energy output, justifying the 'Challenging' classification. The focus on pushing limits within an 'endurance' format further supports this classification.",
