  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Feeling Rhythm 22 Cool-Down' predominantly embodies 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The steady rhythm and cool-down focus, along with the instruction to keep eyes closed, suggest a repetitive and calming experience typical of endurance exercises like rowing, which is even more meditative when combined with a soft music backdrop. The use of Ray Lamontagne\u2019s softer, more calming rock pieces further supports this classification, with a 0.75 score.\n\n'Feeling Rhythm with eyes closed' implies a mindfulness approach, aligning well with 'The Zen Flow,' focused on breath and intentional movement, scored at 0.7.\n\nFinally, as a cool-down workout, it fits 'The Reboot Workout' where gentle movement and relaxation are key, scored at 0.6. The less intense music and a focus on cooling down confirm this more restorative vibe."
