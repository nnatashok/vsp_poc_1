  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Power Climb Row' primarily suggests endurance building and rhythmic climbing at a moderate rhythm pace (max rhythm: 28). This aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind,' which involves a zoning in and repetitive effort, earning a score of 0.7. The use of varying pressure levels and the goal of building endurance also support this vibe.\n\nThe presence of rhythm and endurance elements combined with the playlist featuring indie and global hits suggests a steady, feel-good movement that fits 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, scoring 0.6. The provided music genre and song choices like Dave Matthews Band augment the steady build of feel-good energy typical in an 'Endorphin Wave.'\n\nA slight 'Groove Session' vibe is inferred due to the playlist and rhythmic component, scoring 0.4, as the indie alternative music alongside global hits may invoke a fun, engaging atmosphere. The rhythmic and musical elements lend a playful aspect to the workout, justifying its inclusion with a lower score."
