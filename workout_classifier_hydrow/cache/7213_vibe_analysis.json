  "vibesExplanation": "The workout \"Quick Shifts Warm-Up\" primarily involves shifting between run and walk paces, making it a warm-up with a rhythmic and repetitious element, indicative of \"The Meditative Grind\" vibe. This vibe aligns with the consistent pace seen in warm-ups and endurance-based sessions, earning a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nThe presence of mid-intensity rock and global hits, along with the quick shifts, could also invoke \"The Endorphin Wave,\" which is characterized by elevated energy and feel-good movement. This is supported by the music selection that might elevate the mood, leading to a more energetic warm-up experience. However, since this is a short warm-up rather than a sustained session, the score for \"The Endorphin Wave\" is moderately set at 0.4.\n\nThe workout does not fit high-intensity or competitive categories like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Competitor,\" based on its gentle warm-up focus and lack of intense elements."
