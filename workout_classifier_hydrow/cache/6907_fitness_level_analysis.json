Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort exerted in this workout is predominantly aligned with a Light level. The short duration (5:47) and the 'cool down' category indicate very low energy expenditure, suitable for complete beginners or those needing recovery. Although the guidance from an expert rower implies a potential to introduce slightly more exertion through technique improvement, the intent ('cool down') strongly supports a Light effort requirement. Minimal Moderate consideration is included given the rowing element, which can inherently demand some physicality even when relaxed.",
