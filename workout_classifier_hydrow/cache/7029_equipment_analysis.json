  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Post-Row Stretch' with a focus on stretching, indicated by the workout type 'On The Mat' and category 'stretching'. This implies exercises performed on the floor, typically requiring a mat for comfort and support. The image clearly shows participants on mats, further confirming its necessity. No other equipment is mentioned or implied, as the workout is short and focused on stretching rather than strength or cardio exercises."
