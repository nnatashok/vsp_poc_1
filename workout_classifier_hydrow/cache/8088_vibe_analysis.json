  "vibesExplanation": "The workout named 'Core Focused Row' emphasizes pacing and rhythm with 2 and 3-minute efforts, which aligns well with the \"The Meditative Grind\" vibe, marked by consistent repetition and endurance. The description mentions locking in your pace, which further supports this classification. The hip hop/R&B music genre adds a rhythmic element, supporting a moderate score for \"The Rhythmic Powerhouse,\" which combines beat-driven fluidity with strength. The workout's intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicates substantial effort but not maximal, fitting these vibes. Through the music and the focus on rhythm, the vibe classification excludes explosive or competitive vibes like \"The Firestarter\" or \"The Competitor.\" The confidence in this categorization is high due to these explicit indicators in both the workout's rhythm focus and music selection."
