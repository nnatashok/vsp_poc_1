This is reinforced by the gentle nature of a rowing cool-down.\n\nFinally, the slow rhythm and technique reinforcement suggest aspects of 'The Zen Flow,' with grounding movements appropriate for this vibe, though less emphasized, reflected in the score of 0.5.\n\nPop and global hits like 'All Too Well' by Taylor Swift may contribute to a relaxed and reflective atmosphere, supporting these vibe choices.
