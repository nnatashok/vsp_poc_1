  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily focused on stretching after a rowing session, indicated by the title 'Post-Row Stretch' and the description emphasizing stretching the hips and glutes. This aligns well with 'The Reboot Workout' because it suggests a low-stress, refreshing routine. The mention of 'yoga blocks recommended' and the involvement of mild, intentional stretching points to 'The Zen Flow,' focusing on grounding and breath-centered activity. The short duration and gentle nature of the session, alongside the calming track 'Cirrus' by Bonobo, suggest elements of 'The Deep Recharge,' aimed at resetting and rejuvenating the nervous system. The absence of high energy elements or intense music aligns less with high-intensity vibes, reinforcing the selected classifications."
