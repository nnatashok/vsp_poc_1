  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Breathe through Emotions Row' features elements that align with 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The title and description emphasize reflection on emotions, and the workout type includes 'breathe,' suggesting a focus on relaxation and mindfulness, reinforcing the restorative aspect (Score: 0.75). The low intensity level (1 out of 3) further supports this classification.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is relevant due to the image provided, which shows rowing in a natural outdoor setting on a river. This setting inherently adds an adventurous element, aligning with the spirit's definition (Score: 0.65).\n\nLastly, the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is indicated by the structured intervals (3', 2', 1') and the music-driven playlist, although it's less prominent due to the primary focus on breathing and emotional reflection (Score: 0.4). The pyramid format and music selection provide some rhythm and pacing that fit this spirit. Overall, these elements collectively shape the workout's fundamental energy and approach."
