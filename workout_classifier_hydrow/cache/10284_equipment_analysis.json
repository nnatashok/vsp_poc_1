  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Conquer Your Fears Row' with a strong emphasis on rowing throughout the description, as evidenced by phrases such as 'push through your limits on the Charles River' and 'dynamic workouts that make you feel great inside and out'. The repeated mention of rowing-related activities, including 'rhythm climb paired with shorter intervals', clearly indicates that a rowing machine is essential for this workout. Additionally, the instructor, Aisyah Rafaee, is a former Olympic rower, further underlining the role of rowing in the workout. The category also includes 'row', which ensures the inclusion of a rowing machine with very high confidence."
