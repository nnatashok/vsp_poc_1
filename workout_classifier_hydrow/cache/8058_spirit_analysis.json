  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the workout is 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the rowing session being recorded on a river. The title 'Norwegian Sports Row' and the imagery of rowing in a natural setting strongly emphasize this environmental aspect, hence a high score of 0.9 is assigned.\n\n'Sport & Agility' is also relevant as the workout includes 'climbing intervals,' which suggest an emphasis on athletic skills and performance. The focus on sports culture in Norway supports this interpretation, adding a dimension of sports specificity. Given the intensity level and sports focus, a score of 0.7 reflects the workout's athletic nature.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Flow & Rhythm' were considered but not selected due to the moderate intensity level and absence of explicit cues highlighting extreme energy or music-driven pacing."
