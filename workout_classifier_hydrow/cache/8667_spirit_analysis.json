  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Pyramid Row' includes indicators such as \"patience and resiliency\" and a \"jog pace,\" which align with a more rhythmic and flowing style. This pacing and focus fit well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, meriting a score of 0.6. The description mentions \"efforts,\" a structured format typical of rowing workouts tracking rhythm and coordination.\n\nThe image shows rowing on open water, a clear indicator of an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, deserving a high score of 0.8. The setting highlights environmental factors and exploration, strongly supporting this classification.\n\nThe workout has low intensity, hinting at a controlled pace, excluding 'High-Energy & Intense.' The absence of high precision or structured progression revealed in the metadata does not favor 'Structured & Disciplined.' 'Soothing & Restorative' is unlikely due to the inclusion of pyramid efforts. Lastly, the outdoor aspect and moderate flow indicate a high-confidence classification of 'Outdoor & Adventure' as well."
