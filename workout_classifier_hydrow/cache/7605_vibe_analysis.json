  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Power Flow' strongly embodies 'The Zen Flow' vibe as it emphasizes a grounding and breath-centered practice, consistent with the \"flow\" and \"on the mat\" categories. The setting overlooking Pete's hometown and the optional use of yoga blocks enhance the sense of a meditative, intentional movement. The music, featuring chill and downtempo tracks, supports a relaxed and unhurried environment, justifying a score of 0.9 for this vibe. \n\nAdditionally, the music selection, including upbeat tracks by artists like Kygo and R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL, suggests an element of rhythm and expressiveness, aligning with 'The Groove Session' vibe. The focus on building heat and fluid movement supports a fun and fluid workout experience, warranting a score of 0.7. The moderate match here adds a dynamic element but doesn't overshadow the primary 'Zen Flow' vibe. The short duration of 21 minutes also suggests a focused yet unhurried intensity, fitting both chosen vibes."
