  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Starting Line Row' and the description refers to intervals involving jog and run paces, typically related to a rowing format in indoor workouts. The category includes 'row,' strongly indicating that a rowing machine is central to this workout. Thus, the confidence score for requiring a rowing machine is very high at 1.0. Additionally, the image provided shows rowing on water, although this is likely illustrative rather than literal for the indoor workout setting, further aligning with the use of a rowing machine."
