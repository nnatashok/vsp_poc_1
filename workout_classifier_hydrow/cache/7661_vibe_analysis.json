  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Feel Good Row' is characterized by a steady pace and low intensity, aligning well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The metadata explicitly describes the rowing pattern ('steady pace with a rhythm between 20 and 24'), and the playlist includes feel-good pop songs by artists like Eric Hutchinson and OneRepublic, enhancing the repetitive, calming experience. Thus, this vibe receives a very high confidence score of 0.9. Additionally, the feel-good music and rhythmic elements of the workout also fit 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, as the upbeat music can generate a happy, elevated energy, though it's not as intense. This is supported by the low intensity level (1 out of 3), which facilitates a pleasant, steady build. 'The Endorphin Wave' is assigned a score of 0.7 due to the emotional uplift from the music rather than the physical exertion."
