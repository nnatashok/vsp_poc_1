  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Upper Body Strength with Bands' is primarily classified under 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a high score of 0.9. This is due to the outdoor environment evident in the image, with snow-covered terrain and a natural backdrop, aligning with the Outdoor aspect. The use of resistance bands and a focus on specific muscle groups suggest a structured approach, justifying a 'Structured & Disciplined' classification with a score of 0.7.\n\nThe description mentions strengthening the upper body, indicative of a structured workout aimed at skill development and muscle building, hence supporting the second classification. The music playlist featuring 'Craving You' and 'Thunder' adds an energetic backdrop, which complements the structured regimen but does not strongly indicate high intensity or flow.\n\nThe outdoor setting is a strong determinant, positioning the workout within nature, thereby aligning with the adventure and exploration spirit. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' are less applicable due to the seemingly calm and focused nature of the routine."
