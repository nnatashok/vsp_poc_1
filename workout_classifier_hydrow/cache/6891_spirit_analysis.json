  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the description emphasizing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with phrases like 'give it all you've got' and '15-seconds at a time.' The maximum rhythm of 32 and the intensity level of 3 out of 3 further support this spirit, resulting in a strong score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, since the session is conducted outdoors in downtown Miami and involves rowing on a river, it naturally aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This aspect is verified by the image and the mention of 'explore downtown Miami,' warranting a score of 0.7.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is somewhat relevant given the music-driven playlist including upbeat tracks like 'Shape Of You' and 'Downtown,' which suggest a focus on rhythmic coordination. This connection is less explicit, so it receives a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nOther spirits were less applicable due to the clear emphasis on high intensity and the outdoor setting. The overall confidence is high at 0.85, reflecting strong indicators. "
