  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout clearly embodies the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit, as indicated by the title 'Beginner Yoga Flow' and the use of smooth, downtempo music, which suggests a continuous, music-driven session focused on coordination and fluidity (score: 0.8). The picturesque outdoor setting overlooking Achill Island, referenced in the description, strongly aligns with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit by connecting the activity to nature and exploration (score: 0.7). The playlist comprises calming, atmospheric tracks, and the presence in a scenic setting implies elements of relaxation and tranquility, supporting the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit (score: 0.6). There is minimal indication of high intensity, structured protocols, or sport-specific skills, hence other spirits were excluded."
