  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row' which typically indicates a range from Beginner to Intermediate in Technique Difficulty. The workout format involves a '4-minute on, 1-minute off' pattern, which suggests more about effort than technique. The presence of the term 'Sweat' aligns with workouts that are physically engaging but not highly technical, supporting a Beginner to Intermediate level classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The '4-minute on, 1-minute off' rowing pattern, combined with a workout duration of 16 minutes, indicates a considerable, yet accessible, physical challenge. The 'intensity level: 2 out of 3' suggests a higher effort expectation. The 'Climb' format, which usually involves increased intensity, supports a classification between Moderate and Challenging. Music designed to maintain high energy levels also indicates sustained effort throughout.",
