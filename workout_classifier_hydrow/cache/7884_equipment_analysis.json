  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Whole Body Stretch,' specifically focusing on stretching exercises. It falls under the 'On The Mat' category, which strongly implies the use of a mat. The description mentions stretching hips, hamstrings, back, and glutes, activities typically performed on a mat to provide comfort and stability. The image shows participants on mats, reinforcing the necessity of this equipment.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 0.9 due to the explicit category mention and visual confirmation in the image. Although no other equipment is mentioned, the context strongly suggests that a mat is essential for a comfortable stretching routine."
