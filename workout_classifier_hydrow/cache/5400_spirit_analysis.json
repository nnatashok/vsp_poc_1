  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is characterized as a 'Heat Building Flow,' indicating a continuous and dynamic sequence, likely focusing on rhythm and coordination, which aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The mention of 'fast-paced flow' reinforces this by suggesting a focus on smooth, ongoing movements that build intensity gradually. The playlist with chill and downtempo music supports this relaxed yet energetic flow.\n\nThe outdoor beach setting seen in the image suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit as well. Performing the workout on a natural environment adds an exploratory and adventurous element. \n\nGiven the flowing nature of the session paired with an outdoor setting, the primary spirits are 'Flow & Rhythm' (0.8) and 'Outdoor & Adventure' (0.7), with high confidence considering the clear indicators in the metadata and visuals."
