  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Twists Flow' workout features a slow, flow-based yoga practice led by Owen in the scenic setting of Florence. The use of yoga blocks and the description indicating a focus on feeling 'more spacious' and 'opening up' suggest a grounded and intentional vibe. The chill and downtempo music genre, including artists like Bonobo and Glass Animals, supports a relaxed, immersive experience conducive to mindfulness. Therefore, 'The Zen Flow' is the primary vibe due to the breath-centered and unhurried nature of the practice, assigning it a high score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Meditative Grind' is relevant with a moderate score of 0.7, as the workout emphasizes repetition and mental focus. 'The Reboot Workout' is also slightly applicable with a score of 0.6, focusing on gentle, refreshing movements. Other vibes, such as high-intensity or competitive styles, are excluded due to the absence of energetic or performance-driven elements in the metadata."
