  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which can only be rated Beginner or Intermediate for technique difficulty. Since the User Fitness Level Requirement is Beginner, it aligns with the Beginner level. The rowing format 'Climb' suggests some variability but isn't enough to warrant more than a slight increase towards Intermediate. The max rhythm of 24 strokes per minute indicates a manageable pace for beginners.",
