  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Meditative Grind' is highly suitable with a score of 0.8 because the workout emphasizes maintaining a consistent pace over intervals, suggesting endurance and focus. The steady, rhythmic aspect of rowing along with the long duration of 31 minutes further supports this classification.\n\n'The Endorphin Wave' comes in strong with a score of 0.7 due to the gradual build of energy over the session. The playlist featuring pop and upbeat tracks like 'The Middle' and 'Never Give Up' by Sia supports an elevated, feel-good movement vibe, consistent with this category.\n\n'Groove Session' receives a score of 0.4 as it might be inferred from the dance and global hits stations and lively playlist, although the primary focus remains endurance rather than dance or expressive movement.\n\nThe intensity level is low, steering away from high-energy vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter.' The absence of explosive intervals excludes 'The Firestarter' and 'The Speed & Power Sprint' vibes."
