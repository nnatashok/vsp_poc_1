  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, named 'Steady Cool-Down,' primarily embodies a Soothing & Restorative spirit, scoring 0.9. This is strongly supported by the focus on recovery, the description's emphasis on 'steadily rowing at low rhythms,' and the categorization as a 'cool down.' The max rhythm of 22 also suggests a gentle pace that aligns with relaxation and recovery.\n\nFlow & Rhythm is assigned a score of 0.6, as there is an emphasis on maintaining a consistent low rhythm, suggesting an element of flow and coordination. The integration of music from 'Pop low, Global Hits,' known for their melodic qualities, further enhances this spirit.\n\nThe visual evidence of an outdoor setting by a body of water suggests the Outdoor & Adventure spirit, scoring 0.7. This fits the environment-based aspect of the workout, despite the lack of explicit adventure elements in the metadata. This outdoor setting provides a calming and natural backdrop, resonating with both restorative and rhythmic aspects."
