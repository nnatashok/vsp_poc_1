  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 21:22 implies moderate to challenging exertion, typical for 'sweat' workouts. The 'interval' format with a max rhythm of 28 suggests periods of intensified effort. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 denotes a Moderate effort overall, scoring 0.7. Given the interval nature which includes higher intensity periods, it justifies a Challenging score of 0.5.",
