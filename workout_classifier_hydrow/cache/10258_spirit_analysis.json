  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's title and description prominently mention rowing on the Charles River, which strongly indicates an Outdoor & Adventure spirit, especially given the natural setting. This spirit is awarded a score of 1.0 for being a perfect match. The session is described as 'celebratory' and 'heartwarming', with a focus on enjoyment and shared memories, suggesting elements of Soothing & Restorative, but taking into account the lively and upbeat atmosphere typically associated with the music genres provided, a Flow & Rhythm spirit is more appropriate here due to the rhythmic and coordination aspects of rowing, thus given a score of 0.7. Also, the 'steady' format with a focus on sharing experiences suggests some restorative elements at play, contributing a low score (0.3) for Soothing & Restorative, given its gentle nature implied by the 'breathe' category and low workout intensity level. Other potential spirits like High-Energy & Intense or Sport & Agility were excluded due to the low intensity and focus on memories and celebration, not performance."
