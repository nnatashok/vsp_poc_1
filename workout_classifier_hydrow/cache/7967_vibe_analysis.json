  "vibesExplanation": "The chosen vibes were based on multiple factors: \n\n1. **The Meditative Grind (Score: 0.75):** The workout primarily involves rowing intervals, a repetitive and endurance-focused activity. The interval format and the \"sweat\" category both reinforce the meditative and endurance-driven nature, where zoning in becomes essential.\n\n2. **The Endorphin Wave (Score: 0.7):** The workout aims to raise rhythm and effort, suggesting a steady build-up of intensity typical of an endorphin-releasing session. The inclusion of 'sweat' as a descriptor, along with moderate intensity, contributes to a feel-good, energetic vibe.\n\n3. **The Nightclub Workout (Score: 0.4):** The use of pop music and global hits adds a rhythmic and lively element reminiscent of a nightclub atmosphere. However, the workout lacks explicit dance or rhythm-based movements, resulting in a lower score.\n\nThe intensity level and music genre provide strong evidence but there is some ambiguity due to lack of instructor-led motivation or more explicit rhythmic elements."
