  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is named 'Steady Cool-Down', indicating a focus on relaxation and recovery, which aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The description emphasizes a cool down with technique tips, further supporting this classification with a score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is suggested by the 'steady' pace and rhythmic elements in the music selection, such as 'Hip Hop/R&B Mid, Global Hits', which encourage a smooth and coordinated movement, scoring 0.7.\n\nFinally, the image and the outdoor setting on a river emphasize the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, which is highly relevant as the rowing activity is conducted in nature, scoring 0.8. The inclusion of this spirit is supported by the imagery of rowing in a natural environment. Other spirits weren't considered as the workout's focus on cooling down and its gentle nature are more restorative and explorative rather than intense or structured."
