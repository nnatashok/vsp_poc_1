  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as a 'core specific pilates mat workout,' indicating that a mat is central to performing the exercises comfortably and effectively. The category 'On The Mat' further supports the need for a mat. Given these explicit mentions, the confidence level for requiring a mat is very high at 0.9. No other equipment is suggested or implied in the metadata, reinforcing the focus on mat-based exercises."
