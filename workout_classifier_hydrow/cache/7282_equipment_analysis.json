  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "Given the metadata, the workout is categorized under 'row', which strongly indicates the central use of a rowing machine. The category 'row' mandates including a 'Rowing machine' with a very high confidence level, as it explicitly states that rowing is an essential part of the workout. Furthermore, the mention of 'Newport Harbor' and 'explore' suggests a simulated rowing journey often performed on a rowing machine. There is no mention of any other equipment being necessary or suggested. Thus, the only required equipment with very high confidence is the rowing machine."
