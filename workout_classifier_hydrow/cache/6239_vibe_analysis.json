  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Sleep Prep' is assigned a high score of 0.9 because the workout is explicitly described as 'restorative yoga perfect for before bed,' emphasizing relaxation and preparation for sleep. The playlist featuring chill and downtempo music by artists like RY X and Maggie Rogers supports this calming, restful atmosphere.\n\n'The Zen Flow' is scored at 0.75 due to the intentionality and grounding nature of restorative yoga, combined with the soothing music genre that aligns well with flow and calmness.\n\n'The Deep Recharge' receives a 0.7 score as the workout focuses on low-intensity, ultra-gentle movement aimed at winding down and resetting before bedtime. This matches the description of promoting a nervous system reset through restful activity."
