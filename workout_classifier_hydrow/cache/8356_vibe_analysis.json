  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is a 'Whole Body Stretch,' suggesting a focus on releasing tension and improving flexibility. This aligns well with 'The Reboot Workout' which involves low stress, total-body refresh activities, given the intention to release and enhance flow. The 'Zen Flow' vibe is also fitting due to its grounding, intentional qualities present in stretching routines. The music playlist, featuring songs from indie and global hits, implies a relaxing yet uplifting atmosphere, supporting these vibes. The inclusion of resistance bands and the mention of 'On The Mat' suggests a calming, stability-focused session, further backing a moderate confidence for both 'The Reboot Workout' and 'The Zen Flow.' No high-intensity or competitive elements are present to consider other vibes."
