  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Need for Speed Row\" embodies several spirits. The title and high intensity level (3 out of 3) suggest a strong \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit, supported by classic rock songs like 'Born To Be Wild', which are known for their energetic vibe. The interval format and max rhythm of 32 also contribute to this classification, resulting in a score of 0.75.\n\nThe inclusion of phrases like \"varying rhythms\" indicates a \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit as the session emphasizes rhythmic coordination and stroke technique, scoring it at 0.7.\n\nThe image shows rowing on a river in an outdoor setting, which typically indicates an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. The natural environment and rowing activity strongly align with exploration and nature-based experiences, receiving a score of 0.8.\n\nOther spirits like \"Soothing & Restorative\" are excluded due to the absence of recovery or relaxation elements, and the lack of a specific sport focus rules out \"Sport & Agility\" as primary spirits. \"Structured & Disciplined\" was considered but the emphasis on rhythm and adventure was more significant."
