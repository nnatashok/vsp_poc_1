  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description specifies that it is a 'runners-focused Pilates session,' and the category is 'On The Mat,' which strongly implies the use of a mat for floor exercises typical in Pilates. The image shows a person on a mat, confirming this as the main equipment needed. Thus, the confidence for a mat being required is very high at 0.9."
