Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of approximately 20 minutes and the format of moving for 45 seconds with a 15-second rest suggests a moderate intensity level. The inclusion of exercises like planks and prone push-ups increases the energy expenditure but remains manageable for most users who are not completely detrained, classifying it primarily as 'Moderate'. However, for less fit users, it might feel 'Challenging' due to continuous activity with short rest periods.",
