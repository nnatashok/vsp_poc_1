  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Climbing Intervals Row' and the category 'row' along with the description 'Challenge yourself with Aisyah as you embrace difficulty' strongly indicate the use of a rowing machine, as the workout is focused on climbing intervals and rhythm typically associated with rowing exercises. The metadata clearly places this workout within the 'row' category, which further supports the requirement of a rowing machine. Despite the image suggesting an outdoor rowing context, the context of indoor workout classes typically implies the use of a rowing machine rather than an actual boat, confirming a high confidence score of 0.95 for the necessity of a 'Rowing machine'."
