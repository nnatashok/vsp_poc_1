Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 20-minute duration suggests a moderate effort level for less fit users, especially as it's a guided, steady-paced row. Steady rhythm at 24 indicates a consistent effort without intense bursts, common in heart rate-increasing, moderate workouts. The emphasis on a journey implies a calming, less strenuous intensity compared to High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). Thus, the effort difficulty aligns with Light for those very new to exercise, and Moderate for others requiring a bit more exertion.",
