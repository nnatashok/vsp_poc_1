  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Beginner Yoga Flow\" primarily aligns with the *Flow & Rhythm* spirit. The title and description emphasize a yoga session characterized by flow and relaxation, suggesting a smooth, coordinated movement practice, typical of a flow-centric workout. The description's use of words like \"relax\" and \"fun\" further supports this classification. The playlist, featuring downtempo and chill music like \"Dream\" by Autograf, complements the flow aspect, indicating a rhythmic and paced session.\n\n*Soothing & Restorative* is another spirit present due to the relaxing nature and beginner-friendly approach mentioned in the description. This suggests a gentle, restorative intention within the workout.\n\nThe location in Miami and the workout being conducted outdoors on a mat suggest an *Outdoor & Adventure* element, albeit to a lesser degree. The natural setting provides an adventurous backdrop, enhancing this spirit's presence.\n\nThe high confidence level in identifying these spirits arises from the strong alignment of the description, music, and setting with the spirits identified."
