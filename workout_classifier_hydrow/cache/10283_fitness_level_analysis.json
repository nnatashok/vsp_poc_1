  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which limits it to Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty. The description mentions 'complex techniques' and 'precision,' suggesting a moderate level of complexity in the movements, aligning with Intermediate difficulty. However, given the focus on rowing and the simple rhythm (30 strokes per minute), there's a partial alignment with Beginner due to basic rowing techniques being involved.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session runs for 16 minutes at a moderate rhythm of 30 strokes per minute, but is rated as 1 out of 3 for intensity by the platform, indicating a light workout. The short duration and low intensity suggest low energy expenditure, making it light but slightly leaning into moderate given the interval format which adds a bit of challenge for deconditioned users.",
