  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe classification for this workout is based on several key elements from the metadata. The description emphasizes 'Full body focus' with '1 and 2-minute intervals' using EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute) format, suggesting high-intensity and structured workout elements. This aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' due to its circuit-like and challenging nature, making this a strong match (score: 0.7).\n\nThe presence of high-energy hip-hop and R&B tracks contributes to 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe, as these music genres are known to elevate energy and intensity, earning it a score of 0.65.\n\n'Rhythmic Powerhouse' is also considered due to the beat-driven music and the flow enabled by the rhythmic intervals, giving it a moderate score of 0.6. The workout's structured repetition within intervals and explicit lyrics also enhance this energy.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Competitor' were excluded due to lack of gamified elements, and 'The Meditative Grind' was not selected due to the higher intensity and short duration of the workout."
