  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized by high intensity interval training (HIIT) with \"sprint\" and \"max pace\" intervals, closely aligning it with \"The Firestarter\" vibe due to its explosive, high-intensity nature. The use of intervals and high intensity level (3 out of 3) further reinforces this vibe, leading to a high score of 0.95.\n\nCombined with hip hop and R&B music like tracks from N.W.A. and YG, this workout also captures \"The Adrenaline Rush\" vibe with heart-racing and exhilarating elements. The presence of intense music and unpredictable interval formats contribute to this classification, resulting in a score of 0.75.\n\nConsidering the rowing aspect and prolonged intervals, \"The Meditative Grind\" is appropriate as the repetitive rowing strokes require focus and endurance, albeit less prominently than the other vibes. This supports a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nOther potential vibes like \"The Nightclub Workout\" were excluded due to a lack of emphasis on dance or nightclub-style elements. Overall, the classification confidence is high at 0.85 due to clear indicators of intensity and music style."
