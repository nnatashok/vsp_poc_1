  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'Drive', which is traditionally Hydrow-specific and implies a higher technique requirement. However, since it is a rowing workout, technique complexity is generally not higher than 'Intermediate'. Although 'Drive' would typically suggest advanced elements, rowing is directly defined as a maximum of 'Intermediate' technique complexity. Additionally, being a HIIT format suggests some intensity in execution, which could subtly increase the technical demand.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is marked with maximum intensity ('3 out of 3') and utilizes a HIIT format, which involves high-intensity intervals known for extreme energy expenditure. The session lasts over 21 minutes, requiring sustained effort. The high-stroke rhythm and music playlist (dance and global hits) further imply a demanding pace, reinforcing an 'Extreme' difficulty level. However, considering users in poor physical shape, achieving the high demand may still classify at the 'Challenging' level for most.",
