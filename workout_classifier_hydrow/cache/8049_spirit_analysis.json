  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified with high confidence as 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to several key elements. The title 'Prince William Sound Bow View' and the description, which mentions 'Explore the waters in Alaska,' strongly imply an outdoor and adventure-oriented experience, as participants row virtually through a natural setting. The use of location-specific language, such as Alaska and sound, suggests an emphasis on exploration and environment that characterizes the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The category 'journeys' further supports this classification by indicating a movement-focused exploration rather than skill development or recovery. The absence of an instructor or music genre specification implies the focus is on the immersive outdoor experience rather than musical rhythm or technical instruction, ruling out spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined.' Therefore, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is the most suitable fit, with a score of 0.9, reflecting strong alignment with the spirit's characteristics."
