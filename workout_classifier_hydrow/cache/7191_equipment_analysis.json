  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. This is reinforced by both the workout type 'journey' and the description, which suggest a rowing-based workout exploring the 'bridges and sights around the Port of LA'. In indoor rowing workouts, machines are central to the experience. The explicit mention of category 'row' mandates identifying 'Rowing machine' as essential with very high confidence. No other equipment is mentioned or implied, so no additional equipment is needed for this workout."
