  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'To the Max Row' and the category includes 'row', indicating that a rowing machine is central to the workout. The description mentions '45-second intervals climbing in rhythm', which is a common format for rowing workouts focusing on maintaining a rowing pace. The exercise is marked with 'drive', further implying a focus on rowing intensity. All this strongly suggests that a rowing machine is the primary equipment needed for this workout, justifying a very high confidence level of 0.9."
