  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Steady Cool-Down\" and the description mentions rowing steadily down the Charles River, which implies the use of rowing equipment. Additionally, the category includes 'row', a keyword strongly indicating that a rowing machine is necessary. These factors lead to a very high confidence score of 1.0 for including a rowing machine as required equipment. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata."
