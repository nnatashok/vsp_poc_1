  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing session categorized as 'row', indicating fundamental rowing techniques, which align with beginner to intermediate difficulty levels. The mention of focusing on 'foundations of speed and power' suggests an emphasis on basic mechanics, but the 'interval' format introduces slight complexity, nudging the technique difficulty towards intermediate. Therefore, I assign a stronger score to Beginner (0.6) and a moderate score to Intermediate (0.4). The rowing category precludes Advanced or Expert classification.",
