  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for this workout is skewed towards beginner due to its classification as a 'row' workout, which limits Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The metadata indicates a 'breathe' workout with a steady format, suggesting simple and easy-to-follow rowing movements. The Beginner score is high because the intensity level is 1 out of 3, designed to maintain a consistent effort, aligning with basic rowing technique.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is primarily Light given the workout's short duration (11 minutes) and low intensity level (1 out of 3). The goal is to maintain a steady rhythm with a max stroke rate of 22, suitable for those with low fitness levels. While it's slightly more than minimal physical demand, it's still considered beginner-friendly with some light energetic components, thus Light is strongly aligned and Moderate somewhat aligned.",
