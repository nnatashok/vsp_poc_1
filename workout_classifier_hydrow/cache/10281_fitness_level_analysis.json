  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically limits the technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate according to platform-specific rules. The presence of the 'Drive' tag indicates a more focused and dynamic rowing session, suggesting an Intermediate technique due to the need for good coordination and body awareness. The mention of Olympic rower Aisyah also implies a higher level of precision and skill, aligning with Intermediate technique difficulty.",
