  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is best classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the 'circuit' and 'EMOM' (Every Minute On the Minute) nature of the session, which suggests a fast-paced and demanding routine. The inclusion of dynamic music tracks, such as those from the Hip Hop/R&B and Global Hits genres, further supports an energetic and engaging atmosphere, aligning with a score of 0.75 for this spirit.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is also fitting given the meticulous nature of circuit training and the specified 'upper body focus'. The use of equipment like dumbbells further indicates a structured approach, earning a score of 0.7 for this spirit.\n\nFinally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is somewhat applicable with a score of 0.4. While the circuit format emphasizes precision, the music-driven environment hints at an underlying rhythmic component.\n\nThe imagery and metadata do not support 'Outdoor & Adventure', 'Sport & Agility', or 'Soothing & Restorative', leading to their exclusion in this analysis."
