  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'On The Mat,' indicating that a mat is central to performing the exercises, resulting in a very high confidence score of 1.0 for needing a mat. The workout name 'Post-Row Mobility' suggests it follows a rowing session, which implies the use of a rowing machine. The rowing machine observed in the image further supports this inference, justifying a high confidence score of 0.9 for its necessity. Although the mobility exercises may not directly require the rowing machine, it is relevant to the context of the workout."
