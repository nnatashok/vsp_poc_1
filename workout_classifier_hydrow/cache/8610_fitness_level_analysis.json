  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is 15 minutes long and involves 'opening and strengthening' exercises. Being yoga-focused and described as 'align,' it likely involves slow, controlled movements that don't demand high energy. The availability of chill, downtempo music supports a relaxed session atmosphere. Though some strengthening elements might require moderate effort, overall, the effort difficulty is Light to Moderate.",
