  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as 'Light' with a strong score of 1.0. Given the workout is a 10-minute warm-up with an emphasis on technique and quickness, it is designed to prepare the body gently without excessive exertion. The standard and row categories suggest low intensity suitable for beginners, with potential for slight challenge typical of a warm-up, warranting a lower score in the 'Moderate' range at 0.3.",
