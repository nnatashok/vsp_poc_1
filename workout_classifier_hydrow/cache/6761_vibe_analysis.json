  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Welcome to Tampa Row' is a HIIT-style rowing session, suggesting high intensity and heart-pumping activity, aligning well with 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe. The short duration of 11 minutes and 23 seconds further supports this classification. The music from genres like 'Dance high' and 'Global Hits,' along with tracks that include remixes and upbeat artists like Yolanda Be Cool and CamelPhat, contribute to the 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe, indicating an energetic and rhythm-driven experience. The scenic element of rowing down Hillsborough River adds a dynamic and immersive aspect. Overall, despite the absence of an instructor, the indicators are strong for these vibes, with a very high intensity level and the specified music genre supporting the classification."
