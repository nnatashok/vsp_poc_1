  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title 'Core Focused Row' and category 'row' strongly imply the use of a rowing machine, especially as the workout type involves focus on rhythm and pacing, which are key aspects of rowing workouts. The image shows outdoor rowing, but for indoor equivalent, a rowing machine would be required. The confidence score for 'Rowing machine' is set at 0.9 due to the clear alignment with a rowing-focused workout."
