  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is primarily classified under the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit due to several explicit indicators in the metadata. The circuit format and 'EMOM' (Every Minute on the Minute) structure suggest a methodical and organized approach to the workout, emphasizing technical precision and progressive training methods. The involvement of an experienced coach with an Olympic background reinforces the disciplined nature of the workout. This spirit is assigned a score of 0.75 due to the strong compliance with structured training principles.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant, though to a slightly lesser degree (0.6 score), as the workout aims to improve both strength and cardio, suggesting a rhythmic interplay between exercises. While the exact music genre isn't specified, the mention of '80's, Global Hits' implies a music-driven pacing that may enhance the workout's flow, although this inference is less explicit than the structural elements. The absence of intense, soothing, or outdoor indicators justifies the exclusion of other spirits."
