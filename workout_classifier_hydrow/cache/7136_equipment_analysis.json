  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Finding Breath and Stillness Restore' along with the description 'Feel your breath in each pose' suggest a restorative yoga practice. The category 'On The Mat' implies that a Mat is likely needed for this workout, aimed at comfort and stability during poses. As restorative practices typically involve seated or lying down positions, a Mat would be essential. Therefore, a high confidence score of 0.9 is assigned to the Mat."
