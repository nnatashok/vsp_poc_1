  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified with a primary spirit of 'Outdoor & Adventure' (score: 0.8) due to its setting in Long Beach, California, and the emphasis on an outdoor environment, as visible in the image with natural surroundings by the water. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (score: 0.6) is relevant given the focus on 'strengthen your core' in a prescribed manner, characteristic of structured workouts. The added music elements suggest some level of integration into the flow of the session, but without explicit rhythm coaching, it yields a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a moderate score (0.4). The workout doesn't heavily emphasize high intensity, soothing elements, or sports-specific skills, hence those spirits are not chosen."
