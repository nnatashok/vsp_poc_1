  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'False Creek Stern View' is strongly aligned with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to its setting in the waters of False Creek in downtown Vancouver. The mention of 'Explore' and the use of a real-world location emphasize the exploration and nature-based components typical of Outdoor & Adventure workouts, hence a high score of 0.95. The mention of 'journey' in both the workout description and category further supports this classification. 'Flow & Rhythm' is considered mildly relevant with a score of 0.35, as rowing often involves rhythmic, smooth motions, but the lack of explicit emphasis on music or coordination in the metadata suggests it is not the primary focus. No strong indicators for 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Structured & Disciplined,' 'Soothing & Restorative,' or 'Sport & Agility' are evident, thus these spirits were excluded."
