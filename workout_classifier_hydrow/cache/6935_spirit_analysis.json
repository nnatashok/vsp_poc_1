  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's title and description indicate a high-intensity interval training session (HIIT), specifically with 'high intensity 1-minute intervals,' which aligns with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The mention of a 'max rhythm: 30' and an intensity level of 3 out of 3 further supports this classification, emphasizing a vigorous and demanding workout. The playlist, featuring upbeat and motivational tracks like 'Don't Stop Movin'' and 'Everybody Everybody,' adds to the energetic vibe.\n\nThe image provided shows rowing on a river, suggesting an outdoor setting. Therefore, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is relevant, with a score of 0.7. The nature-based environment enhances the adventurous aspect, but the primary focus of the video remains on intensity, justifying a higher score for 'High-Energy & Intense.' The collaboration between Mike and Mac and the rowing setting\u2019s natural elements slightly underscore the adventurous feel without being the main workout focus."
