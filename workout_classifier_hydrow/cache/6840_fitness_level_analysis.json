Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 20 minutes, which indicates a low to moderate effort requirement, aligning with both 'Light' and 'Moderate' levels. As the workout is a 'journey' rather than high intensity or interval-based, it likely involves a steady, low-intensity pace suitable for deconditioned users. Without high-paced elements or intense cues in the description, the energy expenditure is expected to be low to moderate, thus placing the effort difficulty primarily at a Light level, with some potential for moderate intensity during the duration.",
