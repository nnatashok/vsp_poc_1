  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout has strong elements of 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the rowing being conducted on a river, as seen in the image where the participant is rowing outdoors. This environment inherently provides the sense of exploration and connection with nature typical of the Outdoor & Adventure spirit, warranting a high score of 0.9. Additionally, the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is reflected in the 'steady pace' and 'max rhythm: 26', suggesting a focus on maintaining a smooth, continuous movement pattern, along with music-driven pacing, supported by the playlist consisting of rhythmic pop songs. This gives it a score of 0.7. With an intensity level of 1 out of 3 and the descriptor 'breathe', this workout embodies a more relaxed and rhythmic essence, rather than high intensity or challenging adventure."
