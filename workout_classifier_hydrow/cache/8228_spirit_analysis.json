  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title \"Glacier View Cool-Down\" and description suggest a gentle physical activity focused on relaxation, aligning with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The word 'cool-down' indicates a session intended for calming and recovery, earning it a perfect score of 1.0 in this category. Additionally, the descriptor 'Glacier View' implies an outdoor connection, which typically matches the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, hence it is scored at 0.8 due to the strong environmental component. The \"format: steady\" and maximum rhythm indicate a consistent, smooth pacing that corresponds with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, thus scoring 0.7, as the workout involves row-based rhythm and music. Excluding the 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' spirits is reasonable since the workout focuses on cooling down rather than energizing or performance-based activities. The choice of radio stations playing \"Pop low, Global Hits\" could contribute to a rhythmic flow, but not enough to compete with the dominant restorative and outdoor aspects."
