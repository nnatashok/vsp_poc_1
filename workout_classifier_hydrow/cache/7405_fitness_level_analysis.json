  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described under the 'row' category, which typically aligns with beginner or intermediate technique difficulty. The intervals and rhythm adjustments may require some coordination and rowing technique understanding, hence a minor consideration for intermediate. However, given that it's primarily rowing with the intent of building rhythm, the overall movements are likely beginner-friendly.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes two 4-minute intervals with a max rhythm of 28, indicating a focus on sustained effort. The intensity level is marked as 2 out of 3, suggesting a medium-to-high level of exertion. Given the duration of 11:29, this aligns partially with moderate effort but the interval format and the intermediate rhythm indicate a possibility of higher intensity, thus challenging for less fit users.",
