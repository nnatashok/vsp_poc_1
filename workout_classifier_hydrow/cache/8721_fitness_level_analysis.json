Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of only 5:39, the workout is brief, indicating minimal physical demand. The focus is on mobility and stretching after rowing, which inherently has a low energy expenditure. Typically, such workouts are designed to aid recovery rather than increase physical exertion. Therefore, the effort difficulty is best aligned with a 'Light' level, suitable for all fitness levels, with a slight consideration of 'Moderate' due to potential effort in maintaining some stretches, though this is minor.",
