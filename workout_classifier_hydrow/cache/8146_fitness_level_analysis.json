  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing session categorized as 'breathe', which suggests a focus on steady effort and breathing rather than complexity of movement. With a rhythm of 20 to 24 strokes per minute and a 'Steady' format, it implies a simple rowing technique without intricate or advanced movements, fitting a Beginner level. However, rowing requires some coordination, justifying a slight score for Intermediate.",

The duration of 16 minutes is relatively short for cardiovascular workouts, reinforcing a Light level. The 'Steady' format and 'breathe' type aim for consistent, low-intensity effort. However, as the workout is continuous without breaks, it merits a slight consideration for Moderate difficulty.",
