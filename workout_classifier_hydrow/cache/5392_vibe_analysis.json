  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Master Your Chaturanga' features poses that emphasize core and upper body activation, which aligns with a slow and controlled approach found in 'The Zen Flow.' The chill music genre with tracks by AlunaGeorge and Empire Of The Sun further supports a calm and breath-centered vibe. The categorization as an 'On The Mat' workout and the emphasis on 'align' indicates a focus on precision and intentional movement, which are characteristics of 'The Zen Flow.'\n\nThe vibe 'The Meditative Grind' is also applicable due to the repetitive nature of practicing specific poses like plank and chaturanga, allowing for a zone-in experience. The absence of specified high-energy, explosive movements downplays the likelihood of more intense vibes, supporting a focus on a calm, focused mindset. The music provides a mellow backdrop, further justifying the chosen vibes with high confidence."
