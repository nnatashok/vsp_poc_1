  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title 'Chicago River Stern View' and the description 'Navigate down the Chicago River on a sunny day' explicitly suggest an outdoor rowing experience, aligning perfectly with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The mention of the 'Chicago River' indicates a natural setting, reinforcing this classification. The 'journey' workout type and categorization further support this as an adventure-based training session. The absence of specific intensity or structure details precludes classification into spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined'. Thus, 'Outdoor & Adventure' receives a perfect score of 1.0, with high confidence at 0.9, as there's strong evidence pointing towards this spirit."
