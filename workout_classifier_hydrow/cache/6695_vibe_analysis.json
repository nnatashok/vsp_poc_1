  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Steady Cool-Down' and described as a way to 'decrease your heart rate' which clearly indicates a focus on relaxation and recovery. The use of 'steady' and 'cool down' aligns strongly with the Reboot Workout vibe, scoring 0.8, as it suggests a total-body refresh and low stress. The inclusion of a steady 22 rhythm and calming music from 'Indie Alternative, Global Hits' suggests elements of The Zen Flow, focusing on grounding and intentional movement, hence a score of 0.7. Lastly, the repetitive nature of the rowing and steady pace matches The Meditative Grind, scoring 0.6, as it involves zoning in and locking down the rhythm. The absence of high intensity and the short duration clarifies the exclusion of other high-intensity vibes."
