  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "This workout requires a 'Rowing machine' as evident from the category 'row', which strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. The description mentions a 'rate capped race' and 'maximum meter', both of which are consistent with rowing workouts. Therefore, the confidence for including a rowing machine is very high (1.0), as it is central to executing the specified type of workout."
