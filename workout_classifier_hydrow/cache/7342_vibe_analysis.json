  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Reboot Workout', with a score of 0.9, due to its focus on releasing tension and refreshing the body post-rowing. The description highlighting the gentle release of the lower back and shoulders aligns with the total-body refresh characteristic of this vibe. The 'Foam Roller' indicated in the title and description supports this theme of gentle recovery.\n\nA secondary vibe, 'The Zen Flow', with a score of 0.6, is selected as the session seems to be grounding and intentional, emphasized by the setting on the mat and gentle music choice of Indie Alternative/Global Hits.\n\nLastly, 'The Deep Recharge', with a score of 0.5, is appropriate as the workout is likely to contribute to a nervous system reset through ultra-gentle movement, indicated by the short duration and slow, mindful pace.\n\nThe absence of intense music or high-energy elements excludes other high-intensity vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter'."
