  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is strongly categorized as 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the setting on a river with views of castles and swans, supported by the image showing outdoor rowing. These elements create an adventurous and explorative atmosphere, earning a high score of 1.0. The focus on technique implies a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, as it involves methodical training and precision, reflected in the 'technique-focused session' description, scoring 0.7. The 'breathe' category and low intensity level suggest a 'Soothing & Restorative' element, encouraging relaxation and recovery, thus meriting a score of 0.6. The interval format adds structure but is not intense enough to fit a high-energy classification, and the focus on nature veers away from sports specificity or high performance."
