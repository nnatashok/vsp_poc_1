  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 1.0 due to its setting and approach. The description, 'Row through Downtown Chicago with Mike as you see and learn about each of the 21 bridges on the river,' indicates the workout is taking place in a natural outdoor setting, specifically on a river, which fits perfectly into the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. Additionally, the mention of learning and exploring an environment contributes to this classification.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also a relevant spirit, assigned with a score of 0.6. The workout's format 'Climb' and maximum rhythm of 24 suggests a smooth pace, and the Indie Alternative, Global Hits playlist supports a rhythmic and continuous movement style. The music selection and pacing are likely to enhance the mind-body connection, aligning well with Flow & Rhythm. Although the intensity level is 1 out of 3, which is quite moderate, it complements the rhythmic nature rather than an intense or structured setup.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are not considered because of the low intensity and lack of strict protocols or technical precision."
