  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is named 'Peppy Warm-Up,' suggesting a rhythmic, energetic session intended to prepare the body for further exercise. The description mentions following in rhythm, aligning with a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the emphasis on synchronization with music and movements (score: 0.7). The interval format supports aspects of structure but is more aligned with rhythm due to the warm-up nature. \n\nMoreover, the setting is 'on the shores of Seward,' evident from the image showing an outdoor rowing environment, which classifies the session under the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.8). The natural setting and the rowing on water emphasize exploration and connection with nature.\n\nMusic from 'Country' and 'Global Hits' radio stations complements the lively and engaging atmosphere typical of a Flow & Rhythm spirit. No indicators suggest an intensely structured, high-energy, or soothing focus, hence these spirits were not selected."
