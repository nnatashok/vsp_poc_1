  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description specifically mentions intervals on the \"Hydrow,\" which is an indoor rowing machine. This leads to a very high confidence score of 0.9 for the inclusion of a rowing machine. Additionally, dumbbells are explicitly listed in the metadata equipment tag and visible in the image. The workout description also confirms the use of dumbbells, warranting a high confidence score of 0.8. The category 'On The Mat' does not strongly imply significant use of a mat in this context, given the focus on rowing and dumbbells."
