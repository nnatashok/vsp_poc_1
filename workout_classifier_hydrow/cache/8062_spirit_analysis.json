  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified predominantly as \"High-Energy & Intense\" due to the description mentioning \"high-intensity intervals\" and a maximum rhythm of 32, suggesting a fast-paced rowing session meant to push physical and mental limits. This is reinforced by the workout\u2019s classification as a drive and having a maximum intensity level of 3 out of 3. The selection of music, featuring upbeat tracks like \"Take My Breath\" and \"Stronger,\" further supports this intensity classification, matching a high-energy environment.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is also significant, as the image shows rowing on a river. Although typically associated with outdoor space, the spirit is enhanced by the visual setting, even though emphasis remains slightly lower compared to the intensity focus.\n\nThe \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit receives moderate attention because of the continuity implied by a structured workout sequence and the rhythmic nature of rowing along with pop and global hits music that supports a musical paced session. However, it is less dominant than the intense and outdoor aspects."
