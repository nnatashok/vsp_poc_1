Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's short duration of 5 minutes and focus on being light ('cool down') indicates low energy expenditure, appropriate for a Light effort difficulty classification. There is some mention of '10 stroke accelerations,' which might add slight intensity, placing a weak link to Moderate difficulty. However, the primary focus of a cool-down is relaxation and recovery, strongly supporting a Light effort rating.",
