  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Flow' is primarily classified under 'The Zen Flow' vibe with a score of 0.8. This classification is supported by the focus on breath-centered, core-focused poses, and the use of yoga blocks, aligning with a grounding and intentional practice. The playlist features downtempo and chill music, which complements a calm and smooth flow, reinforcing the zen aspect. There is no intense or high-energy element in the metadata, making it a strong match for a relaxed and nurturing vibe.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Meditative Grind' scores 0.6. The description's emphasis on following the breath and the repetitive nature of the flow movements suggest a meditative, endurance-focused experience. However, the concise duration of just over 21 minutes slightly limits the strength of this vibe, resulting in a lower score compared to 'The Zen Flow.'\n\nBoth classifications resonate with the relaxing and methodical nature of the workout, while other vibes like 'The Groove Session' or 'The Nightclub Workout' were excluded due to the absence of high energy or expressive dance elements."
