  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is categorized as 'Drive', which on Hydrow typically indicates a more complex execution within the rowing domain. However, being a rowing workout, the technique difficulty is inherently capped at Intermediate for non-distance categories. The presence of intervals and maximized rhythm further suggests a higher level of coordination and rhythm execution requirement, substantiating the Intermediate classification with strong confidence.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 21 minutes long and features a series of 45-second maximum effort intervals with a high rhythm rate of up to 34 SPM, indicating a significant energy expenditure. Labelled as 'Drive' with an intensity level of 3 out of 3, and led by a competitive Olympian coach, this suggests a demanding physical output, thus aligning strongly with a Challenging effort difficulty rating.",
