  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Two Stroke Cool-Down' primarily fits 'The Reboot Workout' vibe with a score of 0.7. The description indicates a focus on cooling down and alternating effort, which aligns with a relaxing total-body refresh. The presence of 'cool down' in both the title and description, alongside music from soft Indie Alternative genres, reinforces this vibe. \n\n'\"The Meditative Grind' is also relevant, scoring 0.6, as the repetitive rowing strokes and focus on rhythm (max rhythm: 22) create a monotonous, calming environment typical of meditative sessions.\n\nFinally, 'The Deep Recharge' scores 0.5, suggesting some elements of nervous system reset through gentle movement. While the playlist features calming music, this aligns with a peaceful vibe.\n\nNo intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' apply due to the nature of the workout. Confidence in the vibe assignment is relatively high due to clear indicators in both the format and music selection."
