  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Meditative Grind.' The metadata mentions a focus on power, endurance, and speed through '10-minute segments,' which aligns with the repetitive and endurance-based nature of this vibe. The workout is a 31-minute rowing session, reinforcing sustained effort. The high-intensity level (3 out of 3) and max rhythm of 32 support this choice, indicating a structured, endurance-driven experience.\n\n'Endorphin Wave' is also a strong fit due to the duration and music selection. Dance high and Global Hits radio stations suggest a high-energy, feel-good atmosphere, particularly with tracks by artists like Calvin Harris and Avicii.\n\n'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' is a moderate match owing to the beat-driven nature of the playlist, contrasting dance and electronic elements that enhance the rowing experience. While intensity and music fit, the structured segments lean more towards 'Meditative Grind.' Confidence in these vibes is high due to explicit references to power, endurance, and rhythmic music."
