  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified mainly as 'The Meditative Grind,' with moderate confidence and a score of 0.7, due to its steady, rhythmic nature indicated by the term 'Climb in rhythm' and the sustained rowing format over 16 minutes. The focus on breathing and a moderate rhythm further supports this vibe, as it suggests a repetitive, zoning-in experience.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is also applicable with a score of 0.6, as the workout includes music playlists featuring artists like Richard Ashcroft and Wayne Coyne, which might contribute to a feel-good, elevated energy experience. The described intensity at level 1 suggests a manageable pace that gradually builds up positive energy, aligning with elements of this vibe.\n\nOther vibes, such as 'The Adrenaline Rush' or 'The Competitor,' were excluded due to the low intensity level and absence of competitive or high-adrenaline features in the metadata, focusing instead on rhythmic and steady attributes."
