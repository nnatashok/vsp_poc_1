  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Climbing HIIT Row' primarily matches 'The Firestarter' vibe. The description emphasizes '1-minute sprints' and 'intervals at max pace,' typical of explosive and intense HIIT formats, supporting a score of 0.8 for this vibe. The presence of songs like 'Don't Start Now' and 'Yeah!' from high-energy and dance genres suggests a party-like atmosphere, aligning it with 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe, scoring 0.7 due to the playlist's energetic nature and radio stations like 'Dance high.' Lastly, a score of 0.6 for 'The Adrenaline Rush' is justified by the intense 3/3 intensity level and unpredictable shifts in rhythm during segments, indicating a thrilling and heart-pounding experience. Other vibes, such as 'The Warrior Workout,' are less applicable due to the workout's specific focus on rhythm and pacing rather than raw power and primal energy. Overall, the metadata strongly points to a fast-paced, music-infused explosive workout experience."
