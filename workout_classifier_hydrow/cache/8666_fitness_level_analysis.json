  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Drive' which mandates an advanced classification. However, since it involves rowing-based HIIT with a focus on intervals, the exercises typically involve repetitive rowing motions rather than intricate movements, which correspond to Beginner to Intermediate technique levels. As per Hydrow's guidance, Technique Difficulty in rowing activities remains within these levels even if there's a high intensity.",
