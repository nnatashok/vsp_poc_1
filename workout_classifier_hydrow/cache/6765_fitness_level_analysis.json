  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'Drive' which implies an advanced technique due to its potential complexity. However, row workouts are typically capped at an 'Intermediate' level for Technique Difficulty, as rowing movements, while potentially demanding, are generally not considered expert-level in terms of form complexity. The categorization as a 'row' aligns with an Intermediate level with a high confidence score of 0.9 due to the structured format and controlled environment.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's short HIIT format with 'quick recovery' cycles and the maximum rhythm of 30 suggest a physically demanding session. The Duration is 21 minutes, which, combined with a HIIT structure, implies a high intensity. The workout intensity level is marked 3 out of 3, suggesting it is very demanding for users, pushing it near 'Extreme.' However, we score it 0.7 Challenging due to potential for rapid transitions and high energy exertion indicative of HIIT.",
