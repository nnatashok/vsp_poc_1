  "spiritsExplanation": "The WIN Row workout displays a strong High-Energy & Intense spirit due to several clear indicators. The description mentions a focus on channeling energy and sharpening focus, coupled with a maximum rhythm of 32 and a HIIT format, which suggests a fast-paced, challenging session. The inclusion of pop punk and global hits supports the energetic nature of the workout. A score of 0.8 reflects this strong alignment.\n\nThere is also a Structured & Disciplined element present, as indicated by the focus on 'what's important now' for refocusing and prioritization, along with the methodical nature implied by the HIIT structure. These aspects align with a strong, disciplined approach, meriting a score of 0.7.\n\nAdditionally, there is a Flow & Rhythm component, highlighted by the emphasis on moving through each stroke and the mention of dynamic workouts that might enhance coordination and mind-body connection. However, these elements are less pronounced, resulting in a score of 0.4.\n\nOther spirits, such as Soothing & Restorative or Outdoor & Adventure, were excluded due to the emphasis on intensity and structure rather than relaxation or nature."
