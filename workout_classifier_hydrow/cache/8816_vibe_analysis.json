  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Climbing Warm-Up' with a focus on waking up the body and reducing stiffness aligns well with the 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, particularly due to the rhythmic, repetitive nature of rowing and the inclusion of a climbing format. The description highlights rowing in sync, suggesting a repetitive, zone-in approach characteristic of endurance workouts. The moderate score of 0.6 indicates a noticeable alignment with this vibe.\n\nThe 'Reboot Workout' vibe is also relevant given the workout's aim to reduce stiffness and the use of chill, downtempo music which typically accompanies low-stress, gentle movement sessions suited for refreshing the body. The score of 0.5 reflects moderate alignment due to the warm-up nature of the session.\n\nLastly, 'The Endorphin Wave' is considered with a score of 0.4 due to the instructor's high-energy background and the potential for a feel-good movement experience, especially as the session is designed to wake up the body. However, the warm-up context limits its intensity compared to typical Endorphin Wave experiences.\n\nThe absence of specific music details limits the confidence in precise vibe classification, leading to a moderate confidence level of 0.65 for these assignments."
