  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Mind Over Matter Row' and is categorized under 'row,' explicitly indicating a focus on rowing. The workout type is also labeled as 'drive,' which is commonly associated with rowing activities. Given the emphasis on mental and physical challenges in a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format, a rowing machine is critical for the workout. The image provided further reinforces the requirement of rowing equipment, showing a person engaged in rowing. Therefore, the confidence level for the rowing machine is very high at 1.0, as it is central to the workout."
