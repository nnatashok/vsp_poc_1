  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Philly Climb Row' fits 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its focus on rhythmic rowing, reflected in the title and description ('climb in rhythm'). This suggests a repetitive, endurance-based workout typical of 'The Meditative Grind.' The assigned score is 0.8, indicating a strong match since rowing often fits this vibe by allowing participants to zone in and maintain repetitive motion.\n\n'Endorphin Wave' is also relevant. The upbeat pop music playlist featuring songs by Olivia Rodrigo, combined with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, implies a feel-good movement experience that builds energy steadily. The workout's short duration of 11 minutes and 'sweat' type further support this vibe, as they suggest an invigorating session. The score for this vibe is 0.7, denoting a strong presence of elevated energy and feel-good movement.\n\nThe 'Warrior Workout' and 'Firestarter' vibes were not chosen due to the moderate intensity and absence of high-intensity indicators, such as sprint intervals or explosive movements."
