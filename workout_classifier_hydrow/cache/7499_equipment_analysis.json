  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description emphasizes stretching, with a specific mention of yoga blocks as recommended equipment. This gives a very high confidence score of 0.9 for Blocks, as they are explicitly mentioned. The category is 'On The Mat,' indicating the strong likelihood of a mat being necessary for comfort and support during floor exercises, hence a confidence score of 0.95 for Mat. The workout focuses on stretching 'hips, legs, and ankles,' which are typically performed on a mat, further justifying the inclusion of a Mat as required equipment."
