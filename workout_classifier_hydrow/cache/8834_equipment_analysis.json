  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is a rowing-focused session titled 'Big Climb Row', which clearly indicates the necessity of a rowing machine. The description emphasizes working on endurance and climbing in rhythm and effort, typical of rowing workouts. Furthermore, the category type includes 'row', reinforcing the requirement for a rowing machine with very high confidence (1.0). The instructor's background as Singapore\u2019s first Olympian in rowing confirms this focus. Hence, the rowing machine's central role in the workout is evident, warranting a very high confidence score. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata."
