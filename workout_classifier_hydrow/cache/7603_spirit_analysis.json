  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as \"High-Energy & Intense\" due to the description mentioning \"max pace\" and \"ability to work hard,\" and the intensity level is marked as 3 out of 3. Additionally, the playlist features high-energy tracks, notably from dance and global hits genres, which support a vigorous and dynamic workout environment.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is relevant as the rowing session appears to be conducted in a natural, outdoor setting, as evidenced by the image showing rowing on a river, leveraging the environment as part of the workout.\n\n\"Flow & Rhythm\" is given a moderate score as the workout involves rhythm and musical elements, suggested by the playlist's focus on hit tracks, enhancing the synchronized movement often associated with rowing.\n\nOther spirits like \"Structured & Disciplined\" or \"Soothing & Restorative\" were not applicable due to the emphasis on high energy, pace, and interval training without explicit cues for recovery or technical progression focus."
