  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout 'Lower Body + Core Strength' is part of the 'On The Mat' category, which strongly suggests the use of a mat for floor exercises, contributing to a very high confidence score of 0.9 for 'Mat'. The description mentions 'core exercises, squats, and lunges,' which are often part of mat-based workouts. \n\nAdditionally, 'Yoga blocks optional' implies that blocks may be used to aid or modify exercises, thus receiving a low confidence score of 0.3. The image confirms the presence of both a mat and blocks, supporting these classifications. No other equipment is mentioned or implied, making the mat and optional blocks the only likely requirements."
