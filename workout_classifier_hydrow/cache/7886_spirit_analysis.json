  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Rage Row\" with a description emphasizing high intensity and 60-second intervals strongly suggests a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The format is explicitly described as HIIT, and the rhythm maxing at 32+ supports the notion of a vigorous, effort-intensive session. The music selection from genres such as Hip Hop/R&B with energetic artists like Flo Rida and Nelly further enhances this energetic atmosphere. The image shows rowing on a river, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The natural setting and rowing activity are clear indicators. There is very high confidence in the \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit due to explicit mentions of intensity, while the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" classification is also very strong due to the visual and environmental context. Other spirits are excluded due to the absence of elements indicating rhythm, structure, or relaxation."
