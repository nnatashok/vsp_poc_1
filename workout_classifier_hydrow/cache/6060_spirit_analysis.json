  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Steady Cool-Down' and is explicitly described as a 'cool down' with a focus on 'recovery,' indicating a primary Soothing & Restorative spirit. The use of terms like 'steady' and 'cool down' emphasize a gentle and reparative session. The playlist includes mellow tracks from genres like Indie Alternative, supporting a calming and soothing atmosphere, justifying the high score (0.9) for this spirit. \n\nAdditionally, the workout takes place while rowing down the Charles River. This outdoor setting, especially being recorded on a river, strongly supports the inclusion of an Outdoor & Adventure spirit. The visual evidence displayed in the image further supports this classification, indicating an enjoyment of the environment and natural setting. Consequently, this spirit is scored at 0.8 due to the natural rowing environment. No indicators suggest the presence of the other spirits like High-Energy & Intense or Structured & Disciplined, as the session is focused on recovery and steady pacing."
