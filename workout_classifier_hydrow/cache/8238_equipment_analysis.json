  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, indicating a rowing-related exercise. Though the image depicts outdoor rowing on water, the metadata consistently refers to a rowing context, suggesting the indoor equivalent for workout purposes. The metadata categories 'Cool Down' and 'Technique' further imply that a rowing machine is used to focus on rowing rhythm and form. Given these associations, a rowing machine is necessary to replicate the experience and achieve the workout objectives indoors, thus a high confidence score of 0.9 is assigned to the equipment."
