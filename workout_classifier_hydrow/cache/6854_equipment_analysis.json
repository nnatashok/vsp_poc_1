  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled \"Short Slide Row\" and is categorized under \"row,\" indicating a focus on rowing exercises. The description mentions emphasizing the connection between legs and core during a technique-focused session led by an instructor named Dani. This reinforces the use of a rowing machine since the workout is recorded in the 'sweat' and 'standard' category, commonly associated with high-intensity rowing sessions. \n\nMoreover, the use of terms like \"Max rhythm: 30\" aligns with rowing metrics. The explicit labeling of the workout under the 'row' category confirms the central role of a rowing machine with very high confidence (0.9). Therefore, it is highly likely that a rowing machine is required for this workout session."
