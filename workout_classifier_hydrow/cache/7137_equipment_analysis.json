  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title 'Learn and Burn Row' and metadata category 'row' strongly suggest the use of a rowing machine. Rowing is the central focus, supported by terms like 'cruise down the Rio Guadalquivir' which imply a rowing activity. Given the workout type 'sweat' and its format 'interval', which usually involves intense rowing sessions, a rowing machine is likely required. The image provided reinforces this by showing a person rowing. Due to these factors, a high confidence (0.9) is assigned to the need for a rowing machine."
