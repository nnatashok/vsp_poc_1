  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing session categorized as 'breathe' and 'standard', with a steady pace and max rhythm of 22, which indicates a practice session focusing on consistency rather than complex maneuvers. The metadata describes intervals with a consistent pace, making it accessible for beginners but slightly challenging for those with some rowing experience. Therefore, it strongly aligns with a Beginner technique difficulty, with minor elements suggesting it could be slightly challenging for intermediate users, hence the score of 0.3 for Intermediate.",
