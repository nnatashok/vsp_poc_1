  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Reverse Climb Cool-Down' and the category 'row' strongly imply the use of a rowing machine. The description mentions activities along the Charles River, which aligns with rowing exercises. Furthermore, the term 'Reverse Climb' suggests a rowing format typically executed on rowing machines, reinforcing this requirement. Given the metadata specifies 'row' and features an image with a rower, I assigned a very high confidence score of 1.0 for the rowing machine as essential equipment for this workout."
