  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"All in One + Club 26 Row\" prioritizes rhythm, as highlighted by the focus on \"rhythm 26\" and the structured segments of warm-up, main workout, and cool down. The emphasis on rhythm and steady format, along with pop and global hits music, indicates a strong \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit (score: 0.8). The setting of the workout on water, clearly in a city river environment, aligns with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit (score: 0.8), emphasizing exploration in an urban natural setting. The description also mentions a sweat intensity, but with a level limiting at 2 out of 3, the intensity is not as high as a \"High-Energy & Intense\" classification would require. Additionally, the focused intensity does not align with a primarily soothing or restorative session, confirming the primary spirits selected."
