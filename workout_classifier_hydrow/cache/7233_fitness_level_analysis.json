Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 5-minute stretch session after a rowing activity. Stretching exercises are generally low-intensity, focusing on flexibility rather than stamina or strength, which aligns with the Light effort difficulty. The short duration and the lack of emphasis on energetic or strength-demanding movements corroborate this classification. Therefore, this workout requires minimal energy expenditure, hence a strong alignment with the Light level.",
