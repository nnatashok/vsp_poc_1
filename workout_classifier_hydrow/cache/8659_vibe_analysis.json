  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled \"Hamstring Stretch\" with a brief duration of about five minutes focuses on simple hamstring stretches. The descriptors like 'gain flexibility' and the emphasis on using a resistance band suggest a calming and restorative nature intended to relieve tension and improve mobility. This aligns with \"The Reboot Workout\" vibe, characterized by deep stretching and low stress, earning a score of 0.75.\n\nThe use of a towel or strap as alternative equipment implies inclusivity and ease, which supports the \"The Comfort Moves\" vibe, suitable for safe and feel-good movements, scoring 0.65.\n\nThe music includes reggae and dancehall elements, promoting a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere. However, due to the short time and simple exercise focus, \"The Reboot Workout\" and \"The Comfort Moves\" are a better fit than an energetic vibe."
