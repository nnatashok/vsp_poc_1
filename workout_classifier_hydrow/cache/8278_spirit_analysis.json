  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Lower Body Strength with Bands\" is best classified under the \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit due to its focus on strength-building with the use of a mini band, indicating methodical and technique-focused exercises. The description emphasizes 'building strength,' showcasing a disciplined approach typical of resistance training, earning it a score of 0.7.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is also applicable, as the image depicts a workout setting on a dock by a river, aligning with nature-based and exploratory environments. This visual aspect, combined with the \"on-the-mat\" categorization, suggests an outdoor component, warranting a score of 0.6.\n\nThe music playlist, featuring upbeat pop tracks, supports a rhythmic flow but does not distinctly indicate a \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit due to the structured nature of the workout. Other spirits, such as \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Soothing & Restorative,\" are excluded due to the workout's focus on strength rather than high-intensity cardio or relaxation."
