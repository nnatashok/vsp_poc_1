  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled \"Racing Strength\" with a description emphasizing building strength and preparing for life's stresses aligns with the vibe of \"The Progression Quest.\" This choice is supported by its focus on strength-building, which is methodical and aims for long-term improvement. The inclusion of Indie Alternative and Global Hits music provides a motivating background, typical for incremental strength gains.\n\nAdditionally, \"The Meditative Grind\" is appropriate due to the descriptor \"On The Mat,\" suggesting a repetitive, focused, and concentration-oriented workout experience, perfect for zoning in on the mat. The absence of specified equipment and the short duration (10 minutes 43 seconds) further suggests a straightforward, repetition-based workout flow.\n\nThe vibes have moderate to high confidence levels, given the lack of explicit motivational language typical of \"The Warrior Workout\" or competitive gamification elements of \"The Competitor.\" However, both selected vibes capture the workout's core characteristics effectively."
