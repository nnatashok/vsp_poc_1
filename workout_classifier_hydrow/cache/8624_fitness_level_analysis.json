  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "At 20 minutes and including a variety of dynamic bodyweight exercises like lunges and push-ups, the workout is demanding enough to be rated between Moderate and Challenging. The exercises induce medium energy expenditure due to the involvement of multiple muscle groups and the requirement for continuous movement. The intensity is amplified by the lack of lengthy rest periods and the overall flow from one exercise to another, justifying a Moderate score of 0.7 and a Challenging score of 0.6.",
