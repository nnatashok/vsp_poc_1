  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row' and is explicitly named 'Climbing HIIT Row,' indicating that a rowing machine is integral to the workout. Additionally, the workout description mentions intervals at various rhythms, a format typical for rowing machine exercises. The emphasis on rhythms of 24, 26, and 28 further supports the use of a rowing machine, as these specify stroke rates commonly used in rowing workouts. Therefore, the confidence level for needing a rowing machine is very high at 1.0."
