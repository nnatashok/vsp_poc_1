  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, '1-Minute Sprints Row', strongly aligns with 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its HIIT format, indicated by '1' on, 1' off', and the high-intensity nature with a 'Max rhythm: 32+'. This suggests fast-paced, explosive bursts of effort. The playlist further supports this with high-energy songs like 'Wake Me Up' and 'Block Rockin' Beats', which create an electrifying atmosphere. The inclusion of categories like 'Drive, standard, row', and the intensity level of 3 out of 3, enhance the perception of a sweat-dripping session, thus assigning a score of 0.8.\n\n'Adrenaline Rush' is also relevant as it involves heart-racing activity with unpredictable challenges stemming from the interval nature of the workout (1' on, 1' off') and high music energy, giving it a score of 0.7.\n\nThe moderate score for 'The Meditative Grind' (0.6) reflects the rhythmic and repetitive rowing element, which naturally encourages zoning in during longer sessions, even with intervals, albeit less dominant than the explosive elements. The balanced endurance and interval structure support this vibe."
