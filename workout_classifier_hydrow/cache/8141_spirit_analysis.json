  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Relax and Reflect Cool-Down' is primarily characterized by two key spirits: 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Soothing & Restorative'. The inclusion of a rowing session in Alaska, as indicated by the imagery and description, strongly suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, earning a score of 0.95. The natural setting and environment are integral to this classification.\n\nAdditionally, the workout type is explicitly a 'cool down', combined with the music selection featuring calm and reflective tracks like 'Where Is My Mind' and 'Blank Pages', contributes significantly to a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, scoring 0.9. The focus on reflection and steady pace further supports this classification.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Flow & Rhythm' were excluded due to the calming nature and purpose of the session, which is oriented towards relaxing and cooling down rather than high intensity."
