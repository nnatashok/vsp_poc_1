  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Power HIIT Row', and the description mentions 'sprint and max pace' during high-intensity intervals, indicating a focus on rowing. The category \"row\" confirms that a rowing machine is essential. Although the metadata does not explicitly list equipment, the emphasis on rhythm and high-intensity intervals typical of rowing workouts further supports this. The image shows outdoor rowing, but given the indoor workout context, a rowing machine indoors is implied with high confidence."
