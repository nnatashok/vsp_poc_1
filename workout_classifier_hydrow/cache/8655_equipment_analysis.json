  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Technique Cool-Down' and the description emphasize the focus on rowing technique, mentioning 'pausing at body over' to improve stroke. The category explicitly mentions 'row'. Therefore, a rowing machine is required with very high confidence. The image also depicts rowing, supporting this conclusion. No other equipment is suggested."
