  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Meditative Grind' is chosen with a score of 0.7 because the workout involves climbing in rhythm and intensity, suggesting a focus on endurance and repetition, which aligns with the characteristic of zoning in and letting repetition take over. The duration of 16 minutes and rhythm climbing also indicate a steady and consistent effort. \n\nThe 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe receives a score of 0.6 due to the format and music selection. The use of global pop hits contributes to an elevated, feel-good energy throughout the workout.\n\n'Rhythmic Powerhouse' is also considered with a score of 0.4 as the rhythmic element and pop music suggest a beat-driven session, though the maximum rhythm level indicates a less intense drive compared to more powerful vibes.\n\nThere is high confidence in 'The Meditative Grind,' moderate in 'The Endorphin Wave,' and some elements fit 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse,' though it is not the main focus. Other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded due to the moderate intensity level of 2 out of 3, hinting at a less explosive nature."
