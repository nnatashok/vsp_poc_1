  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Introducing Buffy Row' suggests a focus on rowing with Buffy Williams, known for her athletic background. The use of 'Interval' in the format and 'sweat' in the workout type indicates a moderate intensity, while the 21-minute duration aligns with endurance. The 'standard' and 'row' category suggests steady, focused repetition, fitting 'The Meditative Grind' (score: 0.75) due to the zone-in, repetitive nature of rowing. Inclusion of music genres 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits' adds an uplifting element, pointing to 'The Endorphin Wave' (score: 0.65), portraying a feel-good, steady energy build-up. Confidence is high due to strong implicit cues, although the absence of more specific rhythm indicators introduces moderate uncertainty."
