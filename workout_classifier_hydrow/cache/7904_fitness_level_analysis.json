  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout category is 'row', which limits the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. The instructor emphasizes proper form, suggesting a need for some technical awareness, but the overall workout design 'Breathe' and focus on elevation implies a more accessible workout. Beginner classification is substantial given the user fitness level requirement reinforces this.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of over 11 minutes and the 'breathe' type emphasize a lighter intensity. The intensity level is marked as 1 out of 3, further confirming it is not very demanding physically. While rhythm suggests some energy expenditure, indicators such as 'elevate your rhythm gently' align better with a Light to Moderate categorization.",
