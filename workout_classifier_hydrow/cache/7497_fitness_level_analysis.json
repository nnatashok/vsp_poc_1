  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a short duration of 10:44 and the nature of pilates exercises typically focusing on controlled and low-impact movements, the workout should be relatively easy on effort. The playlist includes motivational pop songs, hinting at a slight intensity increase. However, without high-intensity cues, the effort remains mostly Light, with a partial case for Moderate due to potential steady engagement of core muscles.",
