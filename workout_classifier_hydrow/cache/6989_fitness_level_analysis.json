Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a warm-up, lasting only 5 minutes and 53 seconds, which typically requires low energy expenditure. The focus on rhythm and control suggests light effort is predominant, as warm-ups are not intended to exhaust but prepare the body. However, terms like 'power' and 'control' indicate a moderate challenge for less fit users, particularly in terms of heart rate and energy engaged during rhythmical activity.",
