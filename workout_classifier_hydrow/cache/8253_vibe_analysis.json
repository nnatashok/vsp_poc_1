  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled '60-Second Intervals Row' primarily embodies 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its HIIT format and short, explosive interval nature, capturing the vibe's essence with high intensity and heart rate elevation. This workout scores a 0.9 because it encourages rapid bursts of energy within a limited timeframe, as indicated by the '60-second intervals' and 'max rhythm: 28'. \n\n'Endorphin Wave' is also relevant, with a score of 0.7, due to the feel-good, elevated energy described by phrases such as 'Ready to rev your engine?' The use of popular, upbeat songs like 'Burned By The Love (James Carter Remix)' enhances this vibe by maintaining a motivational and energizing atmosphere throughout the workout.\n\nThe 'Nightclub Workout' vibe also applies with a score of 0.6, influenced by the music selection, which features remixes and pop hits, simulating a high-energy, radio-style playlist often found in social, music-driven environments. While 'Nightclub Workout' isn't a perfect fit due to the intensity and interval structure, the music consistency provides enough basis for this vibe."
