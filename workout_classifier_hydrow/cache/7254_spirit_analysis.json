  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Contemplative Cool-Down' is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.9. This is strongly indicated by the 'cool down' type, the emphasis on 'mentally scanning your body,' and the gradual reduction in rhythm, all suggesting a focus on relaxation and recovery. The reverse climb format and low rhythms further support a soothing session, especially against the backdrop of calming Grateful Dead music.\n\nA secondary classification of 'Flow & Rhythm' is given a score of 0.6 because the session involves continuous movement with rhythmic adjustments, starting at rhythm 24 and working down. Although the main focus is not flow, there is a clear element of rhythmic pacing.\n\nThe image and setting suggest a potential for 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.6, as the rowing appears to take place on a river, aligning with the outdoor classification. However, the soothing and contemplative nature remains dominant in the workout's spirit."
