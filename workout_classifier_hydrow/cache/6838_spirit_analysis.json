  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Cardio Clean Up Row' suggests a mix of 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits. The title and description emphasize building cardio in a rhythmic environment with an interval format ('make small adjustments to your stroke'), which aligns with 'Flow & Rhythm' (score: 0.7). The inclusion of popular and global hit music supports this rhythmic focus. However, the context of rowing in downtown Miami and the image depicting an outdoor setting heavily supports the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.8). The workout is labeled under \"breathe\" with a mild intensity level of 1 out of 3, indicating it's not very intense or competitive, thus leaning away from 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' spirits. There is also less emphasis on methodical structure or recovery, so 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded."
