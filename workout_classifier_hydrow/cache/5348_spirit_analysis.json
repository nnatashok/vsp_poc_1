  "spiritsExplanation": "1. **Outdoor & Adventure (Score: 0.9):** The workout is conducted \"on the Charles River,\" a natural outdoor setting, hence aligning strongly with the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. The rowing experience in a river setting is a hallmark of this spirit.\n\n2. **Flow & Rhythm (Score: 0.6):** The workout involves alternating between a \"22 and 26 rhythm,\" which suggests an emphasis on smooth, continuous movement patterns. The playlist, featuring songs like \"Wake Me Up\" and \"There For You,\" supports a rhythmic pacing indicative of this spirit.\n\n3. **Soothing & Restorative (Score: 0.5):** With a workout intensity level of \"1 out of 3\" and the use of \"breathe\" in the description and category, there is an implication of a gentle, beginner-friendly session that focuses on a calming and restorative experience.\n\nThe title \"Beginner Camp\" suggests a structured approach, but the intuitive and gentle nature of the workout does not strongly align with the Structured & Disciplined spirit. Likewise, the intensity level suggests the session is not highly demanding, ruling out High-Energy & Intense and Sport & Agility spirits."
