  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout takes place on the Charles River, which suggests an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit due to the natural setting and potential engagement with the environment. This is supported by the image showing rowing on open water. The description speaks of challenging \"new speeds\" with \"2-minute intervals,\" indicative of a \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit, further reinforced by the workout's intensity level being marked 3 out of 3. The playlist features energetic tracks like 'Let's Go' by Calvin Harris and 'X Gon' Give It To Ya' by DMX, aligning with high-intensity themes. The presence of structured intervals also adds a competitive and driven edge. The combination of high-intensity music and the natural rowing setting strongly supports these two spirits, with outdoor adventure taking precedence due to the open water rowing context."
