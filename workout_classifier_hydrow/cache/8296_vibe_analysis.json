  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily a hamstring stretch session, which indicates a focus on flexibility, low intensity, and relaxation, aligning well with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, scored at 0.8 for its total-body refresh and low-stress nature. The short duration of 5 minutes and 40 seconds suggests a quick refresh, further supporting this classification. Additionally, the mention of yoga blocks and a towel or blanket suggests elements of yoga or meditative stretching, leading to the inclusion of 'The Zen Flow' vibe, scored at 0.6, for its grounding and intentional movements. The music genre is upbeat ('Dance mid, Global Hits') but still allows for a relaxed and enjoyable session without detracting from the calm focus of stretching. The chosen location at the waterfront in Boston contributes to a tranquil setting, enhancing these vibes. Other vibes were not selected due to the lack of intensity, competition, or high energy."
