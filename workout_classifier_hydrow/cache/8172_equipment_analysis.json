  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata clearly indicates that this workout falls under the 'row' category, which implies the use of a rowing machine as essential equipment with very high confidence (1.0). Although the description suggests that the workout might involve on-water rowing, based on the context of the platform and typical use in such workouts, a rowing machine would be necessary for replication or alternative indoor activities. Additionally, no other equipment is mentioned in the workout metadata or description, reinforcing the centrality of the rowing machine."
