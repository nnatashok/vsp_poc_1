  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Post-Row Core Pilates' has a strong connection to the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The emphasis on Pilates and core support suggests smooth and coordinated movements, aligning with this category. The short duration and music choices like 'The Fray' also contribute to a gentle, rhythmical vibe, earning a score of 0.7.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant due to the session's focus on core support and posture enhancement post-rowing. These elements often carry a calming, restorative intent, though less pronounced, justifying a score of 0.6.\n\nFinally, the photo showing an outdoor setting on a mat introduces elements of 'Outdoor & Adventure.' While not the primary theme, being in nature adds a mild sense of this spirit, scoring 0.5. The use of a wooden platform in a natural setting contributes to this classification. Overall, these spirits capture the core intentions and environment of the workout accurately."
