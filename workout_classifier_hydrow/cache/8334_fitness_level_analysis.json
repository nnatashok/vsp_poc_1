  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is termed as a 'row', which under Hydrow's system implies a Technique Difficulty of either Beginner or Intermediate. Given the focus on 'proper form' and the use of 'Intervals', there may be some additional form complexity, although not highly advanced. The exercise takes place under the 'Sweat' category, often appealing to those newer with some experience, hence aligning slightly more with Beginner level. The Intermediate rating is considered due to intervals requiring more attentiveness to detail and coordination. This is a conservative assessment as the presence of the instructor's emphasis on fun and form suggests inclusivity for less conditioned individuals.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Holiday Learn and Burn Row' is a 21-minute interval workout, suggesting a moderate energy output typical of a Sweat format. The interval nature and a max rhythm of 24 hints at short bursts of intensity within a controlled pace, contributing to a Moderate difficulty rating. Intensity level set at 2 out of 3 indicates moderate physical demand, suitable for users moving beyond complete beginner stages. The workout's focus on achieving specific results hints at potential challenges, hence a slight inclusion of Challenging level. The presence of a lighthearted theme and traditional holiday music further supports a moderate difficulty.",
