  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by its structured approach, given the description of timed intervals at specific rhythms ('10' at a rhythm 20 followed by 10' at a rhythm 22'), indicating a methodical and disciplined session, which secured a high score of 0.8 for the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The use of the word 'steady' and low intensity level suggest a focus on endurance and form.\n\nThe image of rowing on a river and the outdoor setting signify an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, as it leverages the natural environment, earning a score of 0.7.\n\nThe consistent rhythm levels and the inclusion of music with an emphasis on continuous motion and breathing align well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, leading to a score of 0.6. This aspect represents the smooth and rhythmic pacing of the workout.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the moderate intensity and endurance focus, rather than high-intensity bursts or relaxation."
