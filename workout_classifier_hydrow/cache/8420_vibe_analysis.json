  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Time Under Tension Row' primarily aligns with 'The Meditative Grind.' The interval format focused on building cardio and endurance suggests a repetitive, zoning-in experience typical of endurance work. This is reinforced by the strong connection to rowing along the Charles River, hinting at a steady, methodical rhythm. \n\nAdditional insights suggest a mild 'Endorphin Wave' vibe due to the music selections from genres like Indie Alternative and Global Hits, which tend to create an uplifting and steady energy build. \n\nFinally, there is a slight association with 'The Groove Session' vibe, due to the mix of music genres that could add an expressive, rhythmic feel, albeit less evident given the workout's primary endurance focus.\n\nThe absence of highly intense or explosive elements, alongside a moderate intensity level, excludes options like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter.' The confidence level is high due to explicit indicators in the metadata."
