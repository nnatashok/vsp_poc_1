  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Cool Down, standard, row,' and the description specifically mentions 'rowing at a walking pace,' which strongly implies that a rowing machine is the central equipment required for this session. Given the explicit mention of both the category type 'row' and the activity of 'rowing,' it is clear that a rowing machine is essential. The workout's focus on technique during a cool-down further supports the need for a rowing machine, as this would be consistent with refining rowing skills in a low-pressure environment. Therefore, the confidence level for the necessity of a rowing machine is very high at 1.0."
