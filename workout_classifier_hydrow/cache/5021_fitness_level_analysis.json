Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the 15:30 duration and the \u2018journey\u2019 nature of the workout, which typically involves sustained, constant movement rather than intervals or higher intensity, the effort required is primarily 'Light' with a moderate potential for energy expenditure due to the sustained nature of rowing. However, the continuous rowing can be moderately challenging for users who are not in shape, hence the 'Moderate' score exists but with a lighter primary classification.",
