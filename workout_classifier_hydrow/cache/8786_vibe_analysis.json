  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Power + Quickness Warm-Up' and is described as a session focused on increasing power and speed, suggesting elements of 'The Meditative Grind' with repetitive, rhythm-driven movement intrinsic to rowing. This is supported by the climb format and lack of an instructor, indicating zoning in during the workout. Rock mid-intensity music indicates potential for 'The Endorphin Wave' with its feel-good, energy-elevating properties, although it's a shorter warm-up, hence a moderate score. Other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor' were excluded due to the warm-up nature and absence of competitive elements."
