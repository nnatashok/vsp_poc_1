  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'On The Mat' and involves Pilates, suggesting the primary exercise surface is a mat. This is confirmed by the metadata 'Category: On The Mat, standard, on-the-mat' and the image showing use of a mat. The focus on core exercises also aligns with typical mat use in Pilates workouts.
