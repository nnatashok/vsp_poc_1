  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of only 5:47 and marked as a 'cool down' session, the physical demand is minimal. The rowing with eyes closed is more about technique focus than energy expenditure. Therefore, the effort stays light, aligning closely with the 'Light' level of effort difficulty. Short duration and low rhythm reinforce this classification.",
