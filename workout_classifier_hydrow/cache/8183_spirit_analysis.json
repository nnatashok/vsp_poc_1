  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is a Pilates session focused on core activation, indicated by phrases like \"ignite your core\" and \"Pilates.\" This suggests a \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit as Pilates typically emphasizes smooth and controlled movements, mind-body connection, and coordination, supported by the energetic dance and global hits music playlist.\n\nThe image reveals the session taking place outdoors, enhancing a connection to nature, which justifies the inclusion of \"Outdoor & Adventure\" despite the technical Pilates format. This outdoor setting significantly reinforces the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit.\n\nThe 10-minute duration also aligns with these spirits, providing a concise session that prioritizes rhythm and flow without leaning into more structured, intense, or restorative categories. The absence of specific sports context or recovery focus excludes spirits like \"Sport & Agility\" or \"Soothing & Restorative.\""
