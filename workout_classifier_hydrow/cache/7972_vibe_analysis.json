  "vibesExplanation": "The workout \"Sibling Power Row\" is categorized as a rowing session with intervals, indicating a repetitive and endurance-focused activity, aligning well with \"The Meditative Grind.\" This is supported by the duration and the intensity level of 3 out of 3, suggesting a challenging but rhythmic exercise. The music genre is Indie Alternative and Global Hits, which typically support a sustained and engaging flow, reinforcing the meditative aspect with an emotional lift.\n\n\"The Endorphin Wave\" is also a suitable vibe due to the mix of interval types (30-second, 60-second, and 2-minute) which are likely to create a steady build in energy and endorphin release. The playlist containing motivational and upbeat tracks like \"Classic\" by MKTO and \"Geronimo\" by Sheppard further complements this vibe, providing a feel-good rhythm during the workout.\n\nWhile the workout could potentially relate to \"The Competitor\" due to the intervals and high intensity, the lack of explicit competitive or gamified elements makes it less fitting than the other chosen vibes."
