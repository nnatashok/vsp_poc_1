  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Lower Body Circuit\" emphasizes lower body training with a focus on interval-based movements and an EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute) format, which suggests a \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit. The playlist consisting of high-energy hip hop tracks like \"Slam\" by Onyx and \"Party Up\" by DMX supports this classification by providing a driving, motivational backdrop, further implying a vigorous and engaging session.\n\nThe \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit is also relevant due to the circuit nature of the workout and the EMOM format. These elements require precision and a systematic approach to complete each movement within a set timeframe, indicating a certain level of discipline and routine. The metadata mentions a max rhythm of 24, which aligns with a controlled, disciplined effort.\n\nThere is less emphasis on \"Flow & Rhythm\" due to the segmented, interval-based structure, and \"Soothing & Restorative\" is excluded as the session targets intense physical exertion rather than relaxation or recovery. The \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is not applicable, despite the outdoor-looking setting, as the workout is categorized as \"On The Mat.\" Overall, there is high confidence in the selected spirits due to clear evidence in the workout's description and music choices."
