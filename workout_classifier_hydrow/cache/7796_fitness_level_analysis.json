  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is classified under the 'row' category, where technique difficulty is typically Beginner to Intermediate. The exercises involve rowing, a simple movement pattern that newcomers can readily grasp, thus justifying a strong Beginner alignment. The mention of 'fundamentals' further supports this classification, indicating a focus on basic rowing form. While the mention of interval climbing suggests a slight increase in movement coordination, it's not significant enough to elevate beyond Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves intervals of varying intensity (3', 2', and 1' climbing from 22 to 26), leading to different effort levels. While the 21-minute duration and use of intervals introduce a moderate challenge, the overall intensity is rated as 1 out of 3, indicating a suitable level for less fit users. However, intervals and increased rhythm could present additional challenge, supporting moderate alignment and some elements of these classifications as moderately demanding for users with lower fitness.",
