  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' in the metadata. This strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine, as rowing is central to the workout. The image shows an outdoor rowing scenario, yet for an indoor workout setting, a rowing machine would be required to simulate this type of exercise. Thus, a high confidence score of 0.9 is assigned to the necessity of a rowing machine. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata."
