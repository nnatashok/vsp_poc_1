  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 1.0 due to its setting along the Charles River, as indicated by the description and the image showing rowing outdoors. The natural environment plays a significant role in defining this spirit category, making it strongly aligned with outdoor adventure.\n\nAdditionally, 'High-Energy & Intense' is also a relevant spirit with a score of 0.7. The use of intervals and the category 'Sweat' suggest a focus on pushing physical limits and cardiovascular effort, common in high-energy workouts. The playlist featuring energetic songs like 'Heading Home' by Gryffin adds to this vibe.\n\nThe emphasis on cardio and endurance through intervals underlines a dynamic and intense nature, but the outdoor setting is the most defining characteristic, supporting the 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification as primary."
