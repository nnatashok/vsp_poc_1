  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Port of LA Stern View' prominently features outdoor elements, as indicated by the description referencing 'explore the bridges and sights around the Port of LA on this sunny day'. This aligns strongly with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, suggesting a journey-based workout that showcases the natural environment. The use of 'journey' and 'sights' adds to the adventurous aspect, thereby justifying a high score of 0.9 for 'Outdoor & Adventure'. \n\nAdditionally, the categorization of the workout under 'Journeys' and 'row' indicates some continuous rowing action, which could involve a rhythmical pace, lending a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit to the workout. However, without specific musical or pacing cues, this is inferred at a moderate confidence level, meriting a score of 0.5. No explicit intense or structured elements are mentioned, nor is there a focus on restoration or athletic agility, leading to their exclusion."
