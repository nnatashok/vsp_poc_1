  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'St. Patrick's Day Strength' is a 10-minute session focusing on strengthening the abductors and adductors, suggesting a disciplined and focused workout. The use of the term 'strengthen' and 'on-the-mat' category points towards 'The Disciplined Grind' vibe, emphasizing no-frills execution and targeted muscle work. The celebration of St. Patrick's Day combined with music from Indie Alternative and Global Hits provides a festive and playful element, which aligns with 'The Groove Session' vibe, bringing fun and fluidity into the mix. The short duration and specific target of the workout limit its classification to these two vibes, with no high-intensity or deeply meditative elements noted."
