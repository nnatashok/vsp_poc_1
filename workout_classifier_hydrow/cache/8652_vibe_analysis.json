  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe \"The Masterclass Workout\" is assigned with a high score of 0.75 due to the focus on \"Technique\" and the instructive nature of the workout. The description emphasizes learning about rhythm and ratio, indicative of a skill-building session. The use of pop music suggests a light and engaging atmosphere.\n\n\"The Meditative Grind\" fits with a score of 0.7 as the workout involves maintaining 'low rhythms' and is categorized under 'warm-up,' suggesting a repetitive, steady activity that aligns with meditative qualities. The lack of intensity and short duration strengthen this classification.\n\nOther potential vibes like \"The Groove Session\" were considered due to the music genre but were excluded due to the lack of emphasis on expressive or dance-like qualities in the description."
