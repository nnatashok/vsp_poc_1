  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized by steady-state rowing, which is a hallmark of 'The Meditative Grind.' The use of repetition and focus on endurance is strong evidence of this vibe, reflected in the workout name and format. The moderate rhythm and low intensity reinforce the meditative, zone-in quality, thus warranting a high score of 0.8.\n\nThe music selection, featuring indie and global hits, contributes to maintaining a positive and uplifting atmosphere, which aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave.' The gradual buildup in rhythm (from 20 to 22) and indie alternative music add to a feel-good, steady energy, thus supporting a score of 0.6.\n\nThe absence of intense or explosive elements, as well as the categorization under 'Breathe,' also suggests exclusion of more high-intensity or dynamic vibes."
