  "spiritsExplanation": "The title \"Power HIIT Row\" and the format \"HIIT\" indicate a \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit, focusing on short, maximum-effort intervals. Descriptors such as \"sprint and max pace\" and an intensity level of 3 out of 3 further support this classification. The energetic playlist, with tracks like \"Party Rock Anthem,\" also contributes to a high-energy environment, justifying a score of 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of \"explore Miami\" and the image of rowing outdoors strongly suggest an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. This implies nature-based elements and environmental exploration, earning a score of 0.8. This classification is reinforced by the visual of rowing on water, which aligns with outdoor activities.\n\nThe presence of \"Drive\" and \"standard\" in the category indicates a focus on intensity and regular rowing practice but does not alter the main spirits identified. Other spirits, like \"Flow & Rhythm\" or \"Soothing & Restorative,\" were not applicable due to the high intensity and lack of focus on recovery or continuous, smooth movement."
