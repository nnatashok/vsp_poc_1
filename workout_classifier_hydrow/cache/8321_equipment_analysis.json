  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Control Your Rhythm Row,\" indicating a rowing-focused session. The category \"row\" strongly implies that a rowing machine is central to the exercise. Additionally, the description mentions finding power at varying rhythms, a concept typically practiced on rowing machines in indoor settings. Though the image shows outdoor rowing, the metadata suggests an indoor rowing workout, especially with the intensity and power focus, further justifying the high confidence level for a rowing machine."
