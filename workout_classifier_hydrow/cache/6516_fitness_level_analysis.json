  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration of 11 minutes and the restorative nature suggest a low energy expenditure typical of light effort. The description of the workout as 'restorative' and 'perfect for the end of your day' implies a calm, relaxing activity tailored for recuperation. Some slight engagement, akin to moderate effort, may involve holding poses for relaxation but overall remains very light.",
