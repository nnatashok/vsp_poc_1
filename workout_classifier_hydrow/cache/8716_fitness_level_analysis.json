  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row' and the provided user fitness level requirement is 'beginner'. The technique difficulty must align with this requirement. Rowing often involves straightforward, repeated movements and given the intensity of 1 out of 3, the signs point to a basic execution of form, suitable for beginners. The mention of Olympian Buffy provides some context for potential higher-level nuances, but given the metadata, the primary techniques are best suited to beginners. An Intermediate score is possible due to the interval format, which may introduce a variable element to the rowing rhythm, but overall, the workout is primarily beginner-oriented.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 11:25 and an intensity level of 1 indicate that this is not a particularly strenuous workout. The focus on 'breathe' suggests steadier pacing rather than high exertion. The alternate rhythm intervals may present a slight challenge, thus suggesting 'Moderate' is more appropriate for effort due to variations in rhythm that slightly elevate energy expenditure beyond a 'Light' categorization, suitable for beginners looking slightly above low effort levels.",
