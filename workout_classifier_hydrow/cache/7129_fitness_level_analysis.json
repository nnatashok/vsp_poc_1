  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically suggests Beginner or Intermediate level technique difficulty due to the rhythmic and repetitive nature of rowing exercises. Interval format might introduce some complexity as users have to adjust speed in different segments, thus supporting the Intermediate classification as a secondary fit. The primary movements in rowing do not typically demand high levels of coordination, thus strongly aligning with a Beginner technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video lasts for over 30 minutes with a focus on segments that build speed, power, and endurance which can be taxing, especially for deconditioned users. The 'sweat' workout type and an intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggest a physically demanding routine. The interval format with a max rhythm of 32 further indicates a varied and challenging session aligned with Moderate and Challenging effort levels for less fit users.",
