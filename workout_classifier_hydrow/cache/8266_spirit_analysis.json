  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Vltava River Stern View' strongly embodies the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This is inferred from the setting described as taking place along the Vltava River in downtown Prague, providing a scenic and natural outdoor environment. The mention of 'journey' and 'historic sites' further implies exploratory and adventurous elements, justifying a high score of 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is moderately present given the likely continuous and coordinated rowing pattern necessary to traverse a river, and is supported by the 'journey' characteristic, suggesting a rhythmic progression through the landscape. However, the absence of explicit musical elements and pacing factors results in a lower score of 0.4. \n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Soothing & Restorative' lack relevance as there are no indications of extreme physical exertion or recovery focus in the description. As a beginner-friendly workout with no specific intensity cues, these spirits are less applicable, thus not rated."
