  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title 'Breaking Barriers Row' implies pushing limits and overcoming challenges, aligning with a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The description mentions getting 'heart rate pumping' through 'intervals of varying durations', which are typical of intense, high-exertion workouts. Buffy's background as a three-time Olympian and the highest 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3' further reinforce the classification of a high-energy session focused on pushing physical boundaries. \n\nThe use of an Olympian instructor and emphasis on efficient, high-energy workouts with a love for sport suggests a 'Sport & Agility' spirit as well. However, due to the lack of explicit sports-specific skills training and a primary focus on rowing, the score for this spirit is slightly lower. \n\nThere is no indication in the metadata that suggests elements of 'Flow & Rhythm', 'Structured & Disciplined', or other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure', hence they were excluded."
