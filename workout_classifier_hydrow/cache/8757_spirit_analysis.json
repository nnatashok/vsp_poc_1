  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Outdoor & Adventure' (score: 0.9) because the rowing session takes place on a river, which aligns with the outdoor nature theme. The image supports this by showing the participant rowing on water surrounded by nature.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' (score: 0.7) is selected due to the 'steady state row' mentioned in the title and description, suggesting smooth, continuous motion at a consistent rhythm (20 to 22). The use of songs like 'Proud Mary' and 'Blowin' In The Wind' further supports a rhythmic, flowing interpretation.\n\n'\"Soothing & Restorative' (score: 0.6) fits because the workout is categorized under 'breathe' and 'standard', and the intensity level is low (1 out of 3), indicating a gentle, restorative session designed to build a cardio base without high exertion. The music selection, including 90's and Global Hits, suggests a relaxed and familiar ambiance, which can contribute to a soothing experience.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to the lack of indicators for high intensity, structured protocols, or sport-specific training."
