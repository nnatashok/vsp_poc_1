  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'row' and 'drive', which suggests a focus on rowing technique. As per Hydrow's workoutType rule for 'drive', it's classified as Advanced. However, because it's a rowing workout, the technique difficulty is limited to Intermediate as per platform guidelines. The instruction by a former U.S. National Triathlon Team member and focus on '400m repeats' may demand more technical precision than a basic rowing session, confirming this level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's effort is categorized as '3 out of 3' intensity, indicating it is physically demanding. Although the duration of 21 minutes isn't extensive, the format is interval-based, likening it to '400m repeats', which are typically high-intensity efforts with short rests, making the workout effort significant for users in poor physical shape. Given these factors, 'Challenging' is a fitting classification.",
