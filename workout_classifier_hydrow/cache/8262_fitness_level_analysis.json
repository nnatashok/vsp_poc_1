Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of just over 15 minutes and the lack of any mention of intensity or challenges imply an emphasis on sightseeing rather than physical exertion. This aligns closely with Light effort, suitable for beginners focusing on steady pacing rather than high intensity. The Moderate level is given a score as there could be some level of sustaining the pace on the rowing machine, making it somewhat challenging for complete beginners.",
