  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Enhance Your Endurance Row' features a 61-minute endurance rowing session incorporating intervals, which aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its endurance-focused and repetitive nature. The moderate intensity level also supports this classification, suggesting a steady, sustained effort. The high-energy dance and global hits playlist implies elements of 'The Endorphin Wave,' supporting a feel-good, elevated energy experience throughout. Finally, the inclusion of upbeat, dance-oriented music tracks like those from Martin Garrix and Calvin Harris brings in elements of 'The Nightclub Workout,' creating a lively, music-driven atmosphere. The outdoor, sunny setting further enhances the positive energy. These elements suggest a blend of both meditative endurance and energetic music experiences, with moderate confidence due to the lack of specific coaching cues or detailed intensity breakdown."
