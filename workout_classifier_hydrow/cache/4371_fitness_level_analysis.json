Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is designed as a 'cool down', typically involving low intensity and effort. With a short duration of 5 minutes and 48 seconds, and a focus on a steady rhythm, the energy expenditure is very low and consistent with the purpose of helping the body return to a resting state. Thus, this aligns perfectly with a Light effort difficulty classification. The metadata confirms this with strong indicators, resulting in very high confidence.",
