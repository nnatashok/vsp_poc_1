  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Mobility + 10 Min Breathe Combo' predominantly aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, scoring 0.8. The description emphasizes 'opening up and activating your body,' which suggests a focus on mobility and breath work, fitting the restorative spirit. The low intensity level (1 out of 3) further supports this classification as a gentle and recovery-focused session.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant, with a score of 0.6. The use of music genres like Rock low and Global Hits indicates a potential emphasis on rhythm and continuous movement during the workout.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is moderately applicable, with a score of 0.4, due to the visuals showing outdoor settings. However, it's less strongly fitting due to lack of explicit adventure or exploration elements.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the low intensity and absence of sports-specific or high-intensity elements. The structured approach implied by a \u2018combo\u2019 is not dominant enough to classify it as 'Structured & Disciplined.'"
