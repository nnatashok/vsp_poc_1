Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is only 5 minutes and 40 seconds, a typical length for a cool-down session, suggesting very low physical demand. The purpose of cooling down is to reduce heart rate and recover, not to exert significant physical effort. Additionally, the description emphasizes gradually decreasing rhythm and heart rate, verifying that the activity is low-intensity. This aligns well with a Light effort difficulty classification, suitable for lightly engaging the body post-exercise.",
