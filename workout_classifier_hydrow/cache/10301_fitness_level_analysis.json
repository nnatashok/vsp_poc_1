  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique for this 'row' workout can range from Beginner to Intermediate. The rowing strokes are straightforward and align well with beginner-level movements. However, the inclusion of interval sprints and the pacing between 22 and 28 strokes per minute requires some coordination, justifying a partial score for Intermediate. Row categories generally allow for Beginner or Intermediate Technique Difficulty classifications, fitting the user requirement for Intermediate fitness levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a mid-level intensity rowing session (2 out of 3), lasting about 16 minutes. The session includes intervals with 'steady jogs and sprinting runs' which add intensity and increase effort. This format indicates moderate energy expenditure with intervals contributing to its challenging aspects. Thus, it mostly aligns with a Moderate effort difficulty with a partial match for Challenging due to the inclusion of sprint intervals.",
