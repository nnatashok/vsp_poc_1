  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, \"Earth Day: Whole Body Pilates,\" carries a distinct \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit due to the outdoor setting in Seville and the focus on appreciating natural spaces, as indicated by the description mentioning favorite places on Earth. This is strongly supported by the image showing an open natural environment, yielding a high score of 0.85 for this spirit. \"Flow & Rhythm\" is also relevant because Pilates typically involves smooth, continuous movements and a focus on coordination, evidenced by the description mentioning Pilates circuits and the playlist featuring rhythm-driven dance and global hits. This spirit receives a score of 0.75. Lastly, there is a \"Soothing & Restorative\" element, as Pilates is often associated with mindfulness and relaxation, fitting the Earth Day theme of harmony and peace, but with lesser emphasis compared to the other two spirits, garnering a score of 0.55."
