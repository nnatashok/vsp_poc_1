  "vibesExplanation": "The workout features interval rowing with an emphasis on building 'power and endurance,' aligning well with 'The Meditative Grind' due to its repetitive nature and endurance focus. The use of interval formats and a mix of indie alternative to global hits suggests a 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, as these elements may drive the pacing and intensity of the workout. The session is 11 minutes and focuses on a moderate intensity (2 out of 3), indicative of a steady build in energy, which relates to 'The Endorphin Wave.' The playlist includes upbeat and engaging music, supporting these vibes by enhancing the experience without overwhelming, hence avoiding more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout.' Confidence is high due to clear cues in format and music."
