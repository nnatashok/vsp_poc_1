  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Instructional: Core Engagement' combined with the description 'ignite your core and feel it with every stroke' strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. The presence of the 'row' category further reinforces that a rowing machine is central to the workout. The image also shows a person using a rowing machine, confirming its necessary use. Given these factors, the confidence level for needing a rowing machine is very high, at 1.0."
