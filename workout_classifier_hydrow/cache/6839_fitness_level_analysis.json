  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of 01:00:10, which indicates a longer workout session. Although a journey rowing workout does not inherently push for high intensity, the extended duration suggests sustained effort, leading to a moderate energy expenditure. The potential for a slightly increased rowing pace or intensity contributes to a weaker presence of a challenging level. Thus, the effort is primarily Moderate with a secondary inclination towards Challenging.",
