  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which according to platform-specific rules can only have Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty levels. The description specifies a pace row, suggesting straightforward rowing mechanics with a rhythm focus, which does not involve complex movements, aligning closely with a Beginner level. Additionally, the workout's maximum rhythm suggests moderate deviation, supporting only a minor consideration for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of 21 minutes, which is relatively short and designed to accommodate intervals at a moderate rhythm pace. The intensity level is 1 out of 3, indicating it's easy. This aligns strongly with a Light effort difficulty, although interval pacing introduces a slight increase in effort, which could marginally align with Moderate in certain cases.",
