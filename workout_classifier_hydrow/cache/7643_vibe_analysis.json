  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Sweet Spot Row' primarily fits 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its focus on 'negative splitting' and the repetitive rowing format, which encourages zoning in and finding a rhythm. The workout is of moderate intensity with a duration of about 11 minutes, suggesting an endurance component. The score of 0.75 reflects the structured, rhythmic nature, influenced by rowing.\n\n'Endorphin Wave' is also relevant here as the playlist includes upbeat tracks from Dance and Global Hits radio stations, which likely elevate energy levels and sustain a feel-good momentum throughout the intervals. This is reinforced by the music tracks mentioned, warranting a score of 0.7.\n\n'Groove Session' is a lesser match but worth noting due to the dance and global hits music, which may add an element of fun and fluidity to the workout. However, the structure as an interval-based rowing session leans more towards endurance and rhythm, resulting in a lower score of 0.4 for this vibe."
