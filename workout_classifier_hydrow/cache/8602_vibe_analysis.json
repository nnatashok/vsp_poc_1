  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'The Endorphin Wave' due to its high-energy, feel-good nature, suggested by both the presence of motivational music like 'On Top Of The World' and Dani\u2019s reputation for delivering such workouts. The interval format and settings hint at a steady build in energy, typical for an 'Endorphin Wave'. This vibe is rated at 0.78, indicating a strong match due to the explicit description and playlist nature. 'The Competitor' is also a fit due to the high-intensity level (2 out of 3), competitive setting of rowing, and Dani\u2019s medals backing a competitor vibe; score of 0.65 reflects clear intensity but falls short of a full gamified experience. 'The Meditative Grind' receives a score of 0.4, as the repetitive rowing is meditative but is not the focal mood due to upbeat music and workout pacing, thus being a moderate fit. The lack of competition-specific elements reduces the fit for any gamified or tactical vibes."
