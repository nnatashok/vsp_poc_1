  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the descriptors like 'high rhythms' and the focus on rowing at a consistent rhythm of 32+. These elements emphasize the smooth, music-driven pacing typical of this spirit, reinforced by the use of specific radio stations like 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits'.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' is also appropriate with a moderate score, given the 'interval' format and the goal of reaching high rhythms, which implies a level of intensity suitable for warming up for a drive workout.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is included because the image strongly suggests that the workout takes place on water, corresponding with outdoor rowing.\n\nConfidence in these classifications is high, based on clear cues in the workout description and visual context. Other spirits were excluded due to the specific focus on rhythm and outdoor elements without significant emphasis on technical precision or recovery."
