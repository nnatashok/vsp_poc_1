  "vibesExplanation": "The workout '80's Fun Summer Row' presents a distinct vibe blend characterized by elements of fun, rhythm, and endurance. \n\n1. **The Groove Session (0.7):** The use of 80's music with energetic tracks like 'You Give Love A Bad Name' and 'Never Gonna Give You Up' suggests a fun, rhythm-driven exercise, fitting the expressive and fluid nature of a Groove Session. The description emphasizes 'fun with Dani,' which aligns with this vibe.\n\n2. **The Meditative Grind (0.6):** Given the interval format and the relatively moderate intensity level, the workout encourages a rhythmic, repetitive focus foundational to rowing. This vibe is supported by the workout's 31-minute duration, allowing participants to settle into the experience.\n\n3. **The Nightclub Workout (0.5):** Although less intense than some nightclub-style workouts, the presence of 80's hits provides an upbeat, party-like atmosphere, potentially offering a full-body euphoria typical of these sessions. \n\nOverall, loud music and fun intervals support these selected vibes, though the mild intensity lowers the strength of the Nightclub vibe."
