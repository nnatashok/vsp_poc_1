  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'The Meditative Grind' with high confidence due to its focus on maintaining a 'consistent effort' and the steady rowing format. The ambiance of rowing along with a classic 80s playlist creates a repetitive and somewhat meditative experience, which suits this vibe. It scores 0.8 because it perfectly fits the description with the steady rhythm and low intensity.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is also relevant, attributed to the feel-good, energetic nature of the 80s music, especially with tracks like 'Jack & Diane' and 'Pink Houses' by John Mellencamp. This vibe scores 0.6, as the workout incorporates elements like music that elevate energy and mood."
