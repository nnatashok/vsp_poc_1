  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Reboot Workout' is assigned with high confidence (score 0.9) as the workout is explicitly a cool-down session, supported by the title and description emphasizing a steady cool-down approach. This indicates a focus on resetting and refreshing the body, which aligns strongly with the 'Reboot' concept. \n\n'Zen Flow' is also present (score 0.7) due to the calm pace (max rhythm 22) and the nature of tips on making cool-downs a routine part, indicating a grounding and intentional practice. \n\n'Meditative Grind' is considered as well (score 0.6) given the steady rowing and focus on repetitive, calming movements that align with the meditative aspect. \n\nOther energetic or intense vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' are excluded due to the calm and purposeful nature of the session."
