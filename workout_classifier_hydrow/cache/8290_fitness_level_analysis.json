  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout falls under the Hydrow-specific category 'Drive', which is classified as Advanced, overriding the typical rowing classification. However, since the User Fitness Level Requirement is 'Advanced' aligning with the drive conditions, we apply an adjustment considering basic to intermediate rowing skill requirements for less experienced users. The rowing technique utilized likely requires moderate skill in maintaining form and rhythm, justifying a strong rating for Beginner and Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is of short duration (1 minute and 56 seconds), but part of the 'Drive' category designed to test power output, indicated by max rhythm of 32 in a Power format. This implies high-intensity intervals, predicted to be demanding despite short duration, aligning with a rating of 3 out of 3 for intensity. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign a moderately strong Challenging rating and a moderate Extreme level rating given the intensity cues.",
