  "spiritsExplanation": "The core focus on 'core engagement' and the term 'instructional' strongly suggest a \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit, highlighting a methodical approach aimed at technical precision and learning, which is supported by the warm-up category. The mention of 'ignite your core and feel it with every stroke' implies a focus on technique rather than intensity or rhythm. Thus, a score of 0.7 is assigned for this spirit. The outdoor setting depicted in the image provides a connection to the environment, which influences the classification as \"Outdoor & Adventure\" with a score of 0.6, reinforcing the natural setting's contribution to the workout experience. Despite the upbeat music playlist, the instructional and warm-up focus does not align with \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Flow & Rhythm.\""
