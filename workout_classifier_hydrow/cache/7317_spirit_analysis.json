  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies the **Structured & Disciplined** spirit, as it focuses on building strength in a targeted area (lower body) using resistance bands, indicating a methodical and focused approach. The musical choice of dance and global hits might enhance rhythm and pacing, but the technical aspect of resistance band exercises suggests structured training (Score: 0.7). \n\nThe **Outdoor & Adventure** spirit is also relevant, as the image indicates the workout takes place on a rooftop terrace, providing an outdoor setting that might add an element of exploration or taking advantage of the environment (Score: 0.6). \n\nAdditionally, the choice of music like 'Automatic (Frost Remix)' suggests a potential **Flow & Rhythm** aspect, as such tracks typically help maintain a steady, rhythmic pace that could aid in synchronizing movement (Score: 0.5). The categorization as 'on-the-mat' excludes activities involving high-energy dynamics, favoring structured or rhythmic approaches instead."
