  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Power Transitions Row' indicates a high-intensity session with an intensity level of 3 out of 3 and a focus on maintaining power during rhythm shifts. The title and description suggest a demanding pace, fitting the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit (score: 0.79). The specific mention of rhythm shifts aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, with music-driven cues, evident in songs like Avicii's 'Wake Me Up,' supporting continuous movement patterns (score: 0.6).\\n\\nMoreover, the image depicting a rowing session on a river supports the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, as it leverages natural settings. Hence, a score of 0.8 is given here. The lack of specific structured protocol or recovery focus excludes the 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits. Overall, the session embodies characteristics of both 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Flow & Rhythm,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' through its intensity, rhythm elements, and outdoor environment. The confidence is high at 0.85 due to clear indicators in the metadata and visuals."
