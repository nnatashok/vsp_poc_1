  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Post-Row Stretch' and categorized under 'On The Mat', indicating that it involves stretching on the floor. This strongly suggests the use of a mat for comfort and support during the exercises. The image shows mats being used, confirming this inference. There is no mention of other equipment, and the description focuses on stretching, which typically requires a mat. Therefore, the confidence level for the mat is very high at 0.8."
