  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as 'On The Mat,' which explicitly indicates that a mat is required. This is reinforced by the image showing individuals on mats, confirming their necessity for the exercises performed. The high confidence score of 0.9 is justified because the mat is central to the workout, which involves movements performed on the ground. No other equipment is mentioned or shown, suggesting that the mat is the sole requirement for this workout."
