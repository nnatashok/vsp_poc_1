  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Nord\u00e5svannet Bay Stern View' strongly indicates an Outdoor & Adventure spirit. The description mentions an 'escape to the rolling hills of Norway on flat water,' suggesting a scenic and exploratory rowing journey on a natural body of water. This clearly aligns with the characteristics of an Outdoor & Adventure spirit, hence it receives a high score of 0.9. The 'journey' category further supports this classification, emphasizing the exploratory nature of the workout. Additionally, there is a moderate match with the Flow & Rhythm spirit, scoring 0.5, due to the implicit notion of smooth and continuous rowing across flat water, which aligns with maintaining rhythm and coordination as one rows on open water. The absence of explicit music-driven content or high-intensity indicators limits the classification to these spirits. The lack of specified music genre and instructor also suggest that the natural environment and the journey itself are the primary focus, thereby further solidifying the Outdoor & Adventure classification."
