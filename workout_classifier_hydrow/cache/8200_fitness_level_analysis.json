  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which typically involves basic rowing strokes that range between beginner and intermediate complexity. The description specifies '2-minute intervals,' indicating a need for some coordination to maintain rhythm, especially with a 'max rhythm: 32'. Overall, the involvement of interval training slightly increases the technique complexity to Intermediate, but it's predominantly Beginner-friendly due to its rowing nature.",

The engaging hip-hop music and the motivating instructor add to the workout's intensity, aligning with the 'Moderate' level, with a partial alignment to 'Challenging' due to the interval nature.",
