  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Instructional: Power at Low Rhythms,' which indicates a focus on technique and learning ('Instructional'), pointing towards a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The description further stresses learning how to generate power at lower rhythms, emphasizing methodical practice and technique refinement, aligning with structured training. The music choice, including remixes and dance hits, suggests a lively atmosphere even in a slow-paced workout, justifying the 'High-Energy & Intense' classification to some extent despite the low rhythm focus. The use of explicit lyrics, along with song choices like 'Take This Ride' by Vigiland, adds an intensity that may enhance the workout's energy levels, hence a moderate score for 'High-Energy & Intense.' The image shows the workout in an outdoor setting, but this does not fully indicate an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit as the focus remains on the technical skill of generating power in rowing."
