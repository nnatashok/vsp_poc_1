  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This 15-minute yoga workout is moderate in duration and the description indicates a heat-building focus, suggesting a slightly higher energy usage than purely relaxed yoga. The categorization as 'align' implies controlled movements and breathing focus rather than high intensity. The music and 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' setting further suggest a relaxed pace, fitting a Light to Moderate effort.",
