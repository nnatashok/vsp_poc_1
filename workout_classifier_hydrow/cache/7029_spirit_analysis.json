  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified with a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to its focus on stretching and recovery, as indicated by the title 'Post-Row Stretch' and description emphasizing gentle stretching after a rowing session. The use of music by R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL further supports a calm and restorative environment. This spirit receives a high score of 0.9, reflecting a strong alignment with relaxing and recovery-focused elements, despite a dance music influence, which may reduce the soothing aspect slightly.\n\nAn 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also evident because the workout is performed outdoors in New Hampshire, as confirmed by the image showing participants in a snowy landscape. This environmental context, coupled with the 'On The Mat' category, strongly aligns with nature-based exercise settings, earning this spirit a score of 0.85. Other spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility', are excluded due to the lack of intense or athletic indicators."
