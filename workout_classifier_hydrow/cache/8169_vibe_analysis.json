  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is predominantly a 'cool down,' emphasizing relaxation and gratitude, fitting 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which focuses on low-stress, total-body refreshment. The term 'gratitude-focused' indicates mindfulness and reflection, aligning with the calm and restorative nature of this vibe. The use of songs like 'The 1' by Taylor Swift and 'Retrograde' by James Blake, from genres such as Indie Alternative and Global Hits, further enhance the gentle and introspective atmosphere. 'The Zen Flow' vibe is also a fit due to the breath-centered elements, reflected in the calm and steady format with a max rhythm of 20. The short duration and absence of a high-intensity format contribute to the peaceful experience, supporting a moderate confidence score. More intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor' are less applicable due to the lack of intensity and competitive elements, reinforcing the focus on relaxation and recovery."
