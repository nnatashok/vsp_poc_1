  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout name \"Chicago Row\" and the description, \"high-intensity row along the Chicago River,\" strongly indicate that this is a rowing workout. Additionally, the category includes \"row,\" which further supports the need for a rowing machine. Although the equipment section is empty, the repeated emphasis on rowing in both the title and metadata justifies a very high confidence that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
