  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Strength with Bands' with on-the-mat exercises focuses on core strength and stabilization, which aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' due to its enduring and repetitive nature. The score of 0.78 reflects the strength and stabilization focus, intense concentration, and rhythm. The music described as Dance mid and Global Hits suggests a beat-driven environment, which adds a 'Groove Session' vibe to a moderate degree, as the music enhances the expressiveness of the workout. The score of 0.55 reflects this moderate presence of music influence. Furthermore, the playlist with remixes and upbeat tracks indicates an elevated energy contributing to 'The Endorphin Wave,' but not strongly enough as the workout is more stabilization-focused, thus the 0.48 score."
