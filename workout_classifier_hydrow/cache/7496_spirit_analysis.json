  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'High-Energy & Intense' with a very high confidence score of 0.95. This is due to the description detailing '1-minute high intensity intervals' and an intensity level of 3 out of 3, which indicates a fast-paced and demanding workout. The focus on 'attack this workout similarly to a sprint track workout' further emphasizes the intense nature of the session.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant with a score of 0.7. The visual element of rowing on a river fits this spirit, as does the implied environment, enhancing the adventure aspect of the workout. Additionally, the outdoor setting and the suggestion of exploration and challenge align well with the spirit definition.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are not applicable here due to the focus on high intensity intervals and the structured HIIT format. The choice of upbeat pop music supports the energetic and dynamic nature of the session, reinforcing the primary classification."
