  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with high confidence due to its focus on gentle mobility exercises and stretches, evident from the title 'Essential Stretches for Your Back' and the phrase 'Gently move through mobility exercises' in the description. The low-energy nature is supported by the chill and downtempo music genre. This spirit is scored high at 0.9 due to the explicit emphasis on relaxation and recovery.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also present, as the workout is conducted outdoors in Bergen, Norway, possibly near a scenic water or urban setting. This is supported by the category 'On The Mat' and the image depicting a natural outdoor environment. It receives a score of 0.7, indicating a noticeable but less dominant element compared to the restorative aspect.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'High-Energy & Intense' are excluded due to lack of rhythmic pacing or intensity indicators in the metadata."
