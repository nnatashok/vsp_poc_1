Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short, 5-minute warm-up segment, classified as such in the metadata. The focus on 30-second rhythm intervals indicates low energy expenditure typically associated with warming up rather than the actual exertional effort. Thus, it aligns strongly with the Light effort difficulty level. There is a slight Moderate alignment due to the inclusion of rhythm changes that might raise heart rate somewhat for deconditioned users.",
