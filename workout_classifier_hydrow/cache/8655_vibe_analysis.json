  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Technique Cool-Down,' clearly emphasizes technique and control. The key phrase 'improve your stroke' indicates a focus on skill-building, aligning well with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe, which involves technique-driven and focused training. This is further supported by the category tags 'Technique' and 'Cool Down.' The use of pausing also suggests careful skill practice, justifying a score of 0.75. Additionally, it embodies elements of 'The Reboot Workout' due to its classification as a 'cool down' and its relatively short duration (5 minutes and 50 seconds), which implies a low-stress, refreshing exercise aimed at recovery and reset. The music, featuring Hip Hop/R&B Mid and Global Hits, adds a calming yet engaging background, further supporting a relaxing vibe typical in cool downs. Thus, it scores 0.7 for 'The Reboot Workout.' Other vibes were excluded due to the explicit focus on technique improvement and cool down rather than high intensity or endurance."
