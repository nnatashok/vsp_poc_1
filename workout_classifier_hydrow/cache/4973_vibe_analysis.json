  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Cardio Control Row' is characterized by a focus on establishing a consistent pace and controlling power, aligning well with the 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The description emphasizes practicing control at lower rhythms, suggesting a more meditative approach to rowing. With a max rhythm of 24, the intention is to maintain a steady effort, typical of endurance or repetitive workouts. The overall intensity is rated 1 out of 3, confirming a moderate, sustainable effort rather than a high-intensity session.\n\nThe music playlist includes genres categorized under 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits', which introduce an upbeat and energizing element. Songs like 'Floating Through Space' by Sia and David Guetta suggest a feel-good and uplifting atmosphere, indicative of 'The Endorphin Wave'. This comes from the steady energy buildup facilitated by the music selection even though the workout remains moderate in nature.\n\nAdditionally, the use of popular tracks with a dance and global theme provides a subtle 'Groove Session' aspect, though it is not the primary focus, hence its lower score. The overall approach leans towards mindful endurance with a joyous undertone, appropriate for the beginner fitness level and the specified workout format."
