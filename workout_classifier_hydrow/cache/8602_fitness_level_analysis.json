  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout falls under the 'row' category, which allows for Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty classifications. Given the interval format and the high-energy focus described in Dani's style, the technique may involve slightly complex coordination. However, rowing itself is generally considered more beginner-friendly, leading to a stronger alignment with the Beginner technique difficulty. The 'Intermediate' fitness requirement suggests some complexity, justifying a partial fit for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'sweat' and 'high-energy', which indicates a notable intensity, yet the overall duration is relatively short at 11:26 minutes. Therefore, the effort required aligns strongly with Moderate difficulty, particularly for users with low fitness levels. The interval format and rowing at a max rhythm of 28 suggest bursts of higher intensity, contributing to a weaker Challenging difficulty rating.",
