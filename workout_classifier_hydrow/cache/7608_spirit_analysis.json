  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Outdoor & Adventure' because it is conducted on a river, which aligns with the spirit of leveraging environmental challenges and natural settings. The visual evidence strongly supports this classification.\n\nSecondly, 'High-Energy & Intense' is selected due to the description emphasizing 'sprint pace,' 'longer intervals,' and 'max effort,' all of which indicate a high-intensity and vigorous workout. The playlist featuring rock songs aligns with this energetic spirit, further supporting this categorization.\n\nFinally, 'Structured & Disciplined' is relevant as the workout follows an 'Interval' format with a clearly defined structure. The maximum rhythm and intensity level also suggest a disciplined approach to the session.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the lack of emphasis on smooth, continuous movement and recovery, respectively. The overall confidence in these classifications is high due to strong metadata indicators."
