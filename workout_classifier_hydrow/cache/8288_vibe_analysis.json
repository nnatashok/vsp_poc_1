  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified mainly as \"The Warrior Workout\" due to its high-intensity interval structure and maximum intensity rating of 3 out of 3, which suggests a demanding and sweat-dripping experience matching the warrior vibe. The accompanying rock music playlist with songs like 'Zombie' by The Cranberries and 'Paralyzer' by Finger Eleven aligns well with a strong, driving energy found in Warrior Workouts. \\n\n\"The Nightclub Workout\" is a secondary vibe because of the music-centric description, emphasizing 'jamming out' to rock, giving it an energetic and euphoric dance party feel, aligned with high-energy rock mid-intensity mixes. \\n\n\"The Rhythmic Powerhouse\" is considered to capture the beat-driven, music-infused aspect from the rock playlist, supporting the rhythmic and immersive experience. The confidence level is high given the strong alignment of the workout's characteristics with these vibes."
