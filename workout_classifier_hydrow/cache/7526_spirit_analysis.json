  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified with an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit primarily due to the visual of rowing on a river, which aligns with the classification requirement for outdoor water-based activities. This spirit was assigned a strong score of 0.8. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is supported by the music-driven elements, with songs like 'Small Town' and 'Simple Man' enhancing the rowing experience and contributing to a rhythmic atmosphere, hence a score of 0.65. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is highly relevant due to the intervals and the specified max rhythm of 26, suggesting a structured pacing technique, leading to a moderate score for 'Structured & Disciplined' at 0.55. The intervals contribute to a sense of rhythm and coordination, consistent with this spirit. \n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit was excluded due to the workout intensity level being marked as 2 out of 3, indicating it's not at the highest intensity level. The structured nature of the intervals also aligns better with 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' rather than pure high-energy exertion."
