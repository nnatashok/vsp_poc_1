  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Pick Drill + Power Warm-Up' is primarily a technique and power-focused warm-up, indicating a methodical and skill-building approach. This aligns well with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe due to its emphasis on refining technique, justifying a score of 0.75. The description highlights technical focus, common in masterclass vibes.\n\n'Pick Drill' suggests repetitive drills, similar to 'The Meditative Grind', which involves zoning in and focusing on repetitive actions. This is reflected in the second score of 0.6, indicating the presence of long, controlled movements typical of rowing.\n\nThe inclusion of music genres such as Indie Alternative and Global Hits introduces an element of rhythm and energy, albeit not very intense in nature, justifying a lighter influence of 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe with a score of 0.35. However, the workout is a short warm-up, making it less likely to fully embody the steady build of energy typical of an endorphin wave."
