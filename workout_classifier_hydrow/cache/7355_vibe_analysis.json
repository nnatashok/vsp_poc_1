  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Momentum Warm-Up' is primarily focused on preparing the body for further exercise, as suggested by the title and description. The term 'warm-up' indicates a meditative and repetitive nature, while the use of rowing aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, scoring a 0.6 for its repetitive and endurance-based qualities. Additionally, the reference to a 'drive through your legs' and the inclusion of rhythmic intervals suggests a steady energy build, which aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave,' scoring a 0.5 as the workout helps elevate energy levels moderately. The music genres mentioned, 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits,' add an upbeat element but do not significantly alter the primary warm-up nature. The overall confidence in these assessments is 0.75, based on the clear intent of the video to prepare the body with rhythm-based rowing movements."
