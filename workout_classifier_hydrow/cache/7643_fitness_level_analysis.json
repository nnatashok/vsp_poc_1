  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which typically suggests simple movements restricted to the rowing machine. According to our guideline, rowing workouts can be classified as either Beginner or Intermediate in technique difficulty. The presence of phrases like \"in-depth technical detail\" might suggest Intermediate techniques, but \"feel-good\" and high-energy cues skew these towards Beginner. Therefore, there's a stronger alignment with Beginner (0.7) while acknowledging possible complexities (0.3).",
