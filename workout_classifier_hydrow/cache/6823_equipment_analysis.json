  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Power HIIT Row' and the description featuring intervals with a max pace strongly indicate that a rowing machine is central to this workout. The category 'row' further supports that the workout is specifically designed for rowing. Additionally, the format being HIIT on a row implies using indoor rowing equipment for high-intensity interval training. Therefore, a rowing machine is required with high confidence (confidence score: 1.0). The image depicts rowing on water, but in the context of indoor exercise, a rowing machine would be used."
