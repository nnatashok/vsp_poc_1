  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'row' and 'drive,' which in Hydrow's schema typically indicates technical complexity. The workout also involves sprinting efforts, suggesting a need for precise control and power application. Although rowing is generally Beginner to Intermediate in terms of basic form, the 'drive' classification, high rhythm, and advanced fitness requirement suggest Advanced technique difficulty. Therefore, there's a strong alignment with the Advanced level (score: 0.9), supported by the intense sprint efforts.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity level is 3 out of 3, indicative of demanding physical exertion. The session involves 3-minute sprint intervals, necessitating high energy expenditure and limited recovery between efforts, typical of high-intensity workouts. The duration exceeds 17 minutes, aligning with sustained challenging or extreme effort demands. Consequently, there is a stronger fit with the Extreme (score: 0.8) classification, reflecting high energy and endurance requirements.",
