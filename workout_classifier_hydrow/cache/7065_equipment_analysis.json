  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Gradual Climb Row' and the category 'row' explicitly indicate that a rowing machine is required. The description mentions maintaining a fast run pace, likely referring to the rowing machine cadence. The metadata surrounds a climbing format, which is typical in rowing workouts. The image further confirms this as it shows a person on a rowing machine. Given these factors, there is very high confidence (0.9) that a rowing machine is needed for this workout."
