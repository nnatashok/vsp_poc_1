Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of just over 10 minutes suggests a moderate short-term effort level. The use of core stabilization exercises with bands increases energy expenditure beyond Light. Thus, Moderate effort difficulty is strongly supported especially since the exercises focus on strength, which while demanding, isn't extended over a lengthy period. Given that it is a core workout with intervals potentially indicated by music genre pacing, this supports a significant effort without extreme physical demand.",
