  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video, titled 'Power + Quickness Warm-Up,' is categorized under 'row,' indicating a strong emphasis on rowing-related exercises. The image attached also features a person holding rowing equipment, further suggesting the use of a rowing machine. Although the workout description is about prioritizing power and increasing speed, without explicit mention of specific equipment, the 'row' category provides very high confidence (0.9) that a rowing machine is central to the exercise. No other equipment is indicated in the metadata."
