  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 5 minutes and 35 seconds, which indicates a low overall demand in terms of energy expenditure. Mobility workouts typically focus on stretching and relaxation rather than intense physical effort. The absence of intense cardio or weightlifting components, combined with the calming nature of music genres like Latin and Global Hits, supports a classification of Light effort difficulty, perfectly suited for beginners or individuals looking for gentle physical activity.",
