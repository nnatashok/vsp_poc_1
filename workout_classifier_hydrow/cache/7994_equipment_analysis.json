  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata clearly indicates that this workout is a rowing journey titled \"Lake Tahoe Stern View.\" The category \"row\" strongly implies that a rowing machine is essential for performing the workout. The description mentions rowing along Lake Tahoe, which suggests that indoor rowing equipment is used to simulate this experience. Given these explicit cues, there is very high confidence (0.9) that a rowing machine is the core equipment needed for this workout. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata, confirming that the rowing machine is the only necessary gear."
