  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'On The Mat' category, which indicates exercises performed primarily on a mat. This is reinforced by the image showing participants using yoga mats, leading to a very high confidence level (0.9) for mats being required. Additionally, the image reveals the use of yoga blocks for alignment support during postures, justifying a high confidence score (0.9) for blocks. The focus on posture alignment in a yoga context further supports the necessity of these items to properly perform the exercises."
