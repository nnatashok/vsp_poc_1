  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'row' under Hydrow classifications, which restricts technique difficulty to either 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate'. Given the format is a 'Climb' and involves 'stroke-based intervals', there is an element of movement complexity, placing it somewhat between Beginner and Intermediate. Therefore, a moderate Beginner score with a lower Intermediate score is justified.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is marked with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, which indicates moderate intensity, suitable for a wide audience but possibly challenging for those less fit. The 11:20 minute duration and max rhythm of 30 suggest that while the session is relatively short, it is still designed to be physically demanding with stroke-based intervals, justifying a mix between Moderate and Challenging effort scores.",
