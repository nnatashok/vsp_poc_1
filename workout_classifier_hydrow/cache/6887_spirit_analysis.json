  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under 'Structured & Disciplined' due to its focus on technique as described in both the title and description. Phrases like 'Reinforce technique' and 'technique focused' suggest an emphasis on precision and methodical training, which aligns with this spirit.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant with a moderate score since this is a 'cool down' session. Cool-downs are generally aimed at recovery and relaxation, which aligns well with a soothing and restorative intent.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is included with moderate confidence because the image indicates the workout is conducted on water, reinforcing the outdoor element. This environment contributes to an adventurous feel, although it is a secondary aspect.\n\nThe pop and global hits music might suggest elements of 'Flow & Rhythm', but the focus on technique and cool-down shifts the primary classification away from this spirit. The image and lack of high intensity preclude 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' classifications."
