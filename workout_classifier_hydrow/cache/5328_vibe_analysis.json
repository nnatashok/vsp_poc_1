  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video \"Max HIIT Row\" is characterized by intense intervals with a focus on maximal intensity, aligning strongly with \"The Warrior Workout\" vibe, scoring 0.9. This classification is supported by the high intensity level (3 out of 3) and the format being HIIT, emphasizing sweat-dripping, heart-pounding energy. The progression to 30-second maximum intensity intervals also implies a high-energy and demanding session.\n\n\"The Firestarter\" vibe is also appropriate, with a score of 0.75, due to the explosive and electrifying nature of HIIT intervals, which are short and designed for maximum effort.\n\n\"The Competitor\" vibe scores 0.65 as this workout involves intervals progressing from moderate to maximal intensity, potentially appealing to those motivated by a gamified, challenge-focused approach, especially in a rowing context.\n\nIndie Alternative and Global Hits music suggest an engaging and possibly energizing backdrop, enhancing the competitive and exhilarating aspects of the workout. The uncertainty regarding music's direct impact leads to a small deduction in confidence."
