  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.8 due to its description of being a cardio and whole-body circuit. The use of 1 and 2-minute intervals on the Hydrow and the mention of music genres like Hip Hop/R&B High and Global Hits suggest a fast-paced, energetic session. \n\nSecondly, it fits the 'Structured & Disciplined' category with a score of 0.6. The format 'AMRAP' (as many rounds as possible) implies a structured routine focusing on specific goals. Both the duration (around 21 minutes) and the inclusion of dumbbells as equipment point to a well-organized workout session.\n\nThe setting 'On The Mat' suggests a more controlled environment, excluding 'Outdoor & Adventure'. The evident intensity and structure exclude 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Flow & Rhythm', as the workout is more focused on high energy and discipline rather than relaxation or continuous dance-like movement."
