  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Whole Body Circuit,' indicates a high-energy and intense spirit, primarily due to its format and use of circuit training which involves 60-second intervals. The mention of 'total body work' and the use of dumbbells suggest a comprehensive and demanding workout, consistent with high energy levels, which is supported further by a max rhythm of 26. The circuit and interval nature are clear indicators of a structured and disciplined spirit, with a score of 0.6 for following EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute) format, requiring precision and timing. The playlist features energetic Latin and Global Hits music, inferring a rhythmic flow to the exercise, hence a Flow & Rhythm spirit with a score of 0.65. While the primary spirits emphasize energy and rhythm, structured elements are also significant, fitting naturally into a disciplined regime. Soothing & Restorative, Sport & Agility, and Outdoor & Adventure were excluded due to a lack of explicit recovery focus, sports-specific drills, or outdoor/nature-based elements."
