  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'row' and 'sweat,' which typically involves straightforward rowing motions. Although the workout includes '90\" intervals,' it's described primarily as a rowing exercise, indicating basic rowing technique. However, the presence of rhythm intervals suggests some degree of coordination, aligning moderately with Intermediate. The instructor's focus on 'proper form' and reference to 'intervals that pop up in rhythm' further implies the need for some technique awareness beyond Beginner. Hence, a Beginner to Intermediate technique difficulty rating is appropriate, with higher confidence due to explicit metadata descriptions.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is 16:30, with '90\" intervals' suggesting a structured effort that can increase heart rate and energy expenditure, indicative of a Moderate Effort Difficulty. With an intensity marked as 2 out of 3 and rhythm adjustments in intervals, the workout may require significant effort, justifying a secondary Challenging effort level for less conditioned users. Therefore, both levels are appropriate, with moderate-to-high confidence based on workout duration, structure, and intensity indicators in the metadata.",
