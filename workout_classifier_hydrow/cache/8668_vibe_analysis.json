  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'The Warrior Workout' (score: 0.9) due to the high intensity indicated by the metadata: 'high-intensity intervals,' 'drive,' and intensity level 3 out of 3, which aligns with the primal, energy-fueled nature of warrior vibes. The Pop high and Global Hits music playlist, along with an interval rowing format, supports the inclusion of 'The Competitor' vibe (score: 0.7), reflecting a gamified and competitive energy, particularly emphasized by the Charles River rowing setting, implying a performance-oriented approach. 'The Endorphin Wave' (score: 0.7) is also relevant due to the steady building of energy throughout an 11-minute, rhythmic, music-driven activity that fosters feel-good movement and elevated energy, which is implicit in the rhythmic and endurance aspects of rowing. There is high confidence (0.85) in these classifications due to explicit intensity indicators and supportive rhythmic musical elements."
