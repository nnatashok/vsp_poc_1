  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit, 'High-Energy & Intense,' is evident from descriptors such as 'maximum pace,' 'rev your engine,' and a workout intensity level of 3 out of 3. The rhythm range of 28-32 further indicates a fast-paced and high-effort session, supported by the instructive 'drive' format. The playlist consisting of upbeat and energizing tracks suggests an environment aimed at maintaining high energy levels.\n\nThe second spirit, 'Outdoor & Adventure,' can be confidently assigned due to the image showing an outdoor rowing setting on a river, a classic indicator of this spirit. The natural setting alongside the thematic emphasis on adventure and exploration supports this classification.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined,' were considered but less relevant due to the workout's focus on high energy and outdoor environment rather than technical precision or mind-body connection."
