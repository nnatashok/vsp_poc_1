  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Race Intervals Row' and is categorized under 'row,' indicating a rowing-centric workout. The description mentions climbing in rhythm during sets, which is a typical activity performed on a rowing machine. The image also suggests rowing with the visible boats and oars, reinforcing the need for a rowing machine. Therefore, with this strong context, I assigned a very high confidence score to a rowing machine being the required equipment."
