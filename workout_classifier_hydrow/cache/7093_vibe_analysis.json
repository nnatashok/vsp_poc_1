  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Power Rock Row' combines intense rhythmic elements with high energy music. The description mentions a 'power-focused session,' aligning with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, driven by the beat-intense mix of pop-punk and global hits. The interval format and maximum rhythm of 32 suggest a structured yet energetic approach, supporting this vibe, with a strong score of 0.75 due to explicit beat-driven training hints.\n\nThe inclusion of rock tracks and the high-intensity level of 3/3 add elements of exertion and intensity, aligning with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe, which is characterized by primal energy and high exertion. The workout setting in Long Beach adds an open-air dynamic, similar to a warrior-like challenge, scoring 0.65 due to these explicit intensity signals.\n\n'Endorphin Wave' is also a potential match given the steady music build and focus on rhythm and movement, enhancing feel-good energy. The score of 0.55 reflects noticeable elements of energy elevation and continuous motion. The vibe is slightly weaker due to the more aggressive music and intensity level, indicating more of a powerhouse or warrior workout, but still relevant."
