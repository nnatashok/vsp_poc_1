  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, categorized under 'row', typically suggests a Beginner or Intermediate level for technique difficulty. The provided description highlights rhythm-based intervals with focus on self-challenge, suggesting some coordination, which could imply an Intermediate level. However, the Beginner user fitness requirement strongly suggests keeping the technique approachable for lower fitness users, supporting a Beginner classification with moderate confidence.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 16-minute duration of this rowing workout is relatively short, and the workout intensity level is labeled as 1 out of 3, indicating a low energy demand suitable for Light effort difficulty. The mention of 'challenge yourself' during the intervals slightly suggests room for a Moderate classification. However, as it is designed for beginners, we primarily classify this as Light with moderate confidence in accommodating a wider audience.",
