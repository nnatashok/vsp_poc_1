  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Climbing Warm-Up,' with rhythmic and power elements mentioned, suggesting a focus on steady, repeated motion, characteristic of 'The Meditative Grind.'

Additionally, the music genres like 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' suggest a feel-good and energetic atmosphere, aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave,' earning it a score of 0.6. While the presence of rhythm and power could point towards more intense vibes, the short duration and warm-up designation limit the likelihood of high-intensity classifications."
