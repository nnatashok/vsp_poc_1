  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is primarily categorized as Intermediate due to the structured interval format and the focus on maintaining a rhythm of 26, which requires some level of rowing proficiency and coordination. This aligns with the 'sweat' workout type that suggests a more intense focus than beginner exercises. However, since the workout category is 'row', the technique difficulty is logically limited to Beginner or Intermediate levels, with stronger alignment to Intermediate because of rhythm maintenance and interval engagement typical in rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's effort difficulty is classified as Challenging due to the interval nature of the workout (3' and 2' intervals), which inherently increases the intensity level. The duration of 21:30 and an intensity rating of 2 out of 3 also contribute to a higher demanding nature. However, with moderate rest periods between active rowing intervals, this workout remains approachable even for lower fit individuals but is likely taxing due to its interval-based structure, aligning more with Challenging.",
