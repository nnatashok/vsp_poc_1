  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the nature of the plyometric exercises and the circuit format, which implies a focus on high-intensity efforts (score 0.85). The explicit music playlist featuring energetic Latin and Global Hits and the inclusion of a 2-minute interval on the Hydrow enhance this high-energy atmosphere. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also a relevant spirit, indicated by the choice of rhythmic, upbeat songs such as 'Mi Gente' and 'Shaky Shaky,' which suggest a focus on synchronizing movements to these dynamic beats (score 0.75). The AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) format typically supports this flow, allowing participants to get into a rhythm during the session.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is assigned a lower score (0.6) because the circuit format and specific interval on the Hydrow imply a degree of planned sequence and attention to form, although it's secondary to the intensity and rhythm components. The workout's outdoor context does not apply, and it lacks a focus on restorative or sport-specific techniques."
