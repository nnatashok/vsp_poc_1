  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video focuses on rowing technique, which generally aligns with Beginner to Intermediate levels due to the relative simplicity of rowing mechanics compared to more complex movements. The cross-reference with the 'Technique' format in the metadata suggests careful attention to proper form, elevating the potential difficulty slightly, but not above Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 21:30-minute duration combined with a maximum rhythm of 30 suggests Moderate effort, particularly given the aerobic nature of rowing. The 'sweat' workout type and an intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicate it requires more than Light effort, leaning towards Moderate to Challenging for less fit users, especially considering the continuous activity involved.",
