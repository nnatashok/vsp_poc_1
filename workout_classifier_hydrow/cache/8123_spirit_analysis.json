  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Whole Body Pilates' is classified primarily under 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.8. Pilates emphasizes smooth, continuous movements and mind-body connection, which matches the characteristics of this spirit. The playlist, featuring songs with a regular hip hop and R&B beat, supports this flow-oriented atmosphere. \n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant with a score of 0.7 due to the location, Achill Island, indicated in the description. The image provided confirms this outdoor setting, which aligns with the adventurous aspect of the workout spirit.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is applicable with a score of 0.6. As a foundational pilates workout, it likely follows a methodical and progressive structure, which matches this spirit. The presence of a structured routine is a key element of pilates.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to the lack of high-intensity elements, sport-specific agility training, or a focus on relaxation and restorative practices."
