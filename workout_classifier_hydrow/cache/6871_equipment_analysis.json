  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'On The Mat,' which strongly suggests the use of a yoga or exercise mat. Pilates typically involves exercises performed on the floor, and a mat provides cushioning and support for such movements, backing a very high confidence level of 0.9 for the necessity of a mat. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata, making a mat the primary required item for this workout."
