  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is named \"Cardio Intervals Row,\" and the category \"row\" is explicitly mentioned, which indicates the necessity of rowing equipment. Although the equipment section is empty, the consistent naming and categorization strongly suggest that a rowing machine is central to this workout. Additionally, the image provided aligns with the usage of rowing equipment. Hence, a very high confidence score of 0.9 is assigned to the rowing machine requirement."
