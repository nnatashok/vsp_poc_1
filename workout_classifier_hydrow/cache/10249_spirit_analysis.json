  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Total Body Circuit' primarily embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to its format described as an 'invigorating 20-minute total body circuit'. The use of terms like 'power through', 'energized', and 'motivated' alongside the AMRAP (as many rounds as possible) blocks indicate a session meant to push physical limits at a relatively high pace, justifying a score of 0.7. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also relevant, scoring 0.6, as the workout follows a clear circuit structure with specific exercises (banded side squats, walkout planks, uneven push-ups, and glute bridges) and time divisions (two six-minute AMRAP blocks), indicating a methodical approach. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, scoring 0.5, is supported by the description of dynamic movement and the rhythmic influence of '00s Hip Hop mid to high, Global Hits' music, suggesting a coordinated and music-driven experience. Equipment simplicity with a resistance band instead of dumbbells aligns with maintaining flow and rhythm."
