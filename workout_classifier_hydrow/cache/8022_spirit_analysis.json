  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Gulf of Alaska Bow View' strongly suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the emphasis on exploring a natural setting, the Gulf of Alaska, and rowing towards a glacier, which implies engagement with nature. The term 'journey' in the workout type and category further reinforces the adventurous aspect as it hints at exploration and movement through an outdoor environment. Due to these strong indicators, 'Outdoor & Adventure' receives a high score of 0.9.\n\nA secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm,' is suggested by the need for continuous rowing motion which often aligns with rhythmical pacing and coordination, essential in rowing activities. Although there is no specific mention of music, the flow required to maintain a steady rowing pace justifies a moderate score of 0.5 for 'Flow & Rhythm.'\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were not considered as there are no explicit mentions of intensity or relaxation in the metadata. The confidence level is relatively high at 0.85, given the explicit mentions of the natural environment correlating with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit."
