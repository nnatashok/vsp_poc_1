  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is designed to 'build heat' through a power flow yoga routine lasting over 21 minutes. The terms 'build heat' and 'power flow' suggest a moderate to high energy expenditure. Typically, yoga flows increase heart rate and require continuous movement without long breaks. These factors contribute to a moderate difficulty, with aspects drifting towards challenging due to the increased intensity from power movements sustained throughout the session.",
