  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled \"Finding Breath and Stillness Restore\" strongly indicates a focus on relaxation and mindfulness, which aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The mention of 'breath in each pose' suggests a grounding and breath-centered experience, typical of this vibe. This is reinforced by descriptors like 'restorative practice' and 'restore,' indicating an unhurried, calming approach, hence a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe use of soothing music genres, such as 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo,' complements the peaceful setting, which aligns with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe, known for its focus on nervous system reset and gentle movement. The short duration and restorative nature suggest a mild match with a score of 0.75.\n\nFinally, 'The Reboot Workout' involves low stress and refreshing movements, resonating with the restorative theme but less directly, earning a moderate score of 0.6. Aspects like the short duration and focus on breath align moderately with this vibe."
