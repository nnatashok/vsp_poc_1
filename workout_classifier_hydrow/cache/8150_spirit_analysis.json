  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Chicago River Bow View,\" which immediately suggests an outdoor setting on water. The description emphasizes navigating the Chicago River on a sunny day, reinforcing this activity as an outdoor adventure. The 'journey' type and the category tags, such as 'Journeys' and 'row', further indicate an experiential, exploratory nature typical of an Outdoor & Adventure spirit. As rowing is often rhythmic and flow-oriented, despite lacking specified music, the workout can also exhibit a Flow & Rhythm spirit, as the activity involves smooth, consistent motion inherent in the rowing process. The absence of an instructor and the lack of specific music genre may reduce confidence in any guided rhythmic flow but do not detract from the primary outdoor nature of the workout. The confidence level of 0.85 reflects strong certainty in these categorizations due to consistent evidence of an adventuring journey on the water."
