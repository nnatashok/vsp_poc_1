  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Arms Focused Cool-Down\" primarily embodies the Soothing & Restorative spirit. It is a cool-down session, as indicated by both the title and description, emphasizing recovery and relaxation. The emphasis on arm timing and technique suggests a calming focus on form and precision, further supporting this classification. The Outdoor & Adventure spirit is present due to the rowing setting on a river, as evidenced by the image, indicating a natural environment. This contributes to an exploratory feeling in the session. The Structured & Disciplined spirit is also evident from the focus on technique and timing, which follows a methodical approach. The combination of structured technical training with a serene setting characterizes the overall spirit of this session."
