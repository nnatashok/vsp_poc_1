  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive', which according to Hydrow-specific rules, corresponds to a high level of technical difficulty within rowing workouts. However, given the primary rowing-based focus of Hydrow, such difficulty often caps at the 'Intermediate' level. The sprint and max pace intervals require coordination and technical skill but still align with the 'Intermediate' category.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout comprises 90-second sprints and max pace pushes, indicating a high-intensity interval training format. The maximum rhythm of 28 increases the energy expenditure, making it physically demanding. While effort difficulty is seen as 'Challenging' primarily, the intense 30-second max push segments can push the effort difficulty towards 'Extreme'.",
