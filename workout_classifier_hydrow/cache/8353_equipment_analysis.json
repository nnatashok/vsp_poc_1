  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category and explicitly states 'row' in both the title 'Legends + Myths Row' and the 'Workout Type.' This indicates a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session using a rowing machine. The category and title strongly imply the centrality of rowing equipment, leading to a very high confidence score of 1.0 for the need of a rowing machine. The accompanying image also depicts a rowing scenario, further confirming the workout's focus on rowing."
