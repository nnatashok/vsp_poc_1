  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video, titled 'Whittier Challenge Row,' explicitly falls under the 'row' category, indicating it's centered around rowing. The description mentions a challenge for maximum meters, typical of rowing workouts focused on distance. Thus, a 'Rowing machine' is required. The very high confidence level (1.0) is due to the clear and explicit association with rowing in the metadata, consistent with both the workout title and the 'row' category classification."
