  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Feel Good Row' is characterized by a steady rhythm and feel-good music, suggesting a smooth and continuous movement experience, aligning well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The choice of a playlist with uplifting songs supports the emphasis on coordination and mind-body connection, leading to a strong score of 0.8 for this spirit. \n\nAdditionally, the workout takes place outdoors on a river, which is a clear indicator of the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The description does not highlight performance or competition but suggests a leisurely, enjoyable experience in a natural setting. This setting justifies a score of 0.7 since the outdoor environment contributes to the adventure aspect, yet the workout is not primarily focused on exploring or environmental challenges."
