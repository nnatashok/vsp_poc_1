  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' due to its emphasis on cooling down and reinforcing technique. The description mentions 'cooling your body down,' which suggests a focus on recovery and relaxation, fitting the restorative spirit very strongly, hence the score of 0.9.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' also applies, as the image shows the session taking place on a river. This aligns with the spirit of exploring outdoor environments, earning a score of 0.75 due to this explicit depiction.\n\nThe workout is not high-energy or intense, as indicated by the low max rhythm of 22 and the clear categorization as a 'cool down.' The focus on steady pacing and reinforcement of technique does not strongly connect to structured training protocols but rather complements the primary restorative emphasis. Likewise, there are no significant sports-specific skills or agility focus indicated, excluding 'Sport & Agility' from the classification. The music is popular and adds an ambient element but doesn't dominate the workout's energy."
