  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session, suggesting intense and short bursts of energy, which aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe. The description indicates a focus on fast-paced intervals, with a maximum rhythm of 32 strokes, supporting a strong, primal energy vibe, scoring a 0.75.\n\nThe use of rowing as the primary athletic focus also suggests 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, as the repetitive nature of rowing can create a zone-in experience that fits this vibe, but with less intensity due to the HIIT format. This results in a moderate vibe score of 0.6.\n\nThe playlist features upbeat, feel-good pop songs, typical in music for 'The Endorphin Wave', promoting elevated energy and a steady build throughout the workout, giving this vibe a score of 0.65.\n\nThe absence of any dance or euphoric elements in the metadata excludes 'The Nightclub Workout', while the lack of a slow, controlled focus on breath excludes 'The Zen Flow'. Overall, the metadata provides strong evidence for the selected vibes."
