  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'drive', which according to Hydrow's specifications, automatically requires advanced technique. The challenge involves sustaining a high rhythm (32+) with Power format, indicating a complex, structured effort that demands good coordination and body awareness. Despite being part of a rowing workout, which generally trends lower in technique difficulty, the 'drive' categorization and intensity adjustments place it between Intermediate and Advanced techniques.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's format mentions 'Power' and involves an intense one-minute challenge at a high rhythm (32+), which significantly increases the energy expenditure. Coupled with the intensity level rated as 3 out of 3, this signifies a demanding physical challenge suitable primarily for more fit individuals. The short duration does not lower the effort difficulty due to sustained high intensity throughout, making it Challenging to Extreme.",
