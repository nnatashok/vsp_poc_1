  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, scoring a 0.7 because the instructor, Rina Thomas, is described as bringing 'high energy' and a 'fast-paced, spicy style' to her sessions, indicating a vigorous and energetic approach. The presence of 90-second intervals on Hydrow and a max rhythm of 24 suggest a cardio-intensive style typical of high-energy workouts. The 'EMOM' (Every Minute On the Minute) format speaks to a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, scoring a 0.6, as it typically involves a disciplined structure where exercises are performed methodically at the start of each minute. Although classified as beginner-friendly, this format can still reflect a structured approach. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, scoring a 0.5, is considered due to the influence of music genres like Latin and Global Hits, which may emphasize movement accompanied by rhythm. Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to lack of emphasis on recovery or a nature-focused setting."
