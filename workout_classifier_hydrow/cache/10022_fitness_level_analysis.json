Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of over 30 minutes, incorporating both dumbbell exercises and cardio intervals, this workout is relatively demanding. The fast-paced style and circuit format suggest a consistent level of effort throughout, indicative of a 'Challenging' classification, particularly for less fit users. However, the availability for beginners implies that intensity may be scaled or moderated, allowing for a 'Moderate' intensity experience for those starting out, hence the scores span both levels.",
