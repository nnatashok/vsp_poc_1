  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Bodyweight Strength' is classified primarily as 'Structured & Disciplined' with a high score of 0.75. This is due to the interval structure of the exercises (30\u201d and 45\u201d intervals of bodyweight exercises), emphasizing methodical progression and clear protocol. The detailed focus on core, lower, and upper body also aligns with this spirit.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is also relevant with a score of 0.7 because the workout is conducted outdoors, as evident in the image provided, which features an outdoor setting with notable landmarks, enhancing the adventure aspect of the spirit.\n\nAdditionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' receives a moderate score of 0.6, as the workout includes music commonly associated with rhythmic movement (songs like 'Levitating' and 'Shivers'). The energetic music choices suggest an element of flow in the sequences.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were not selected as the focus on structured bodyweight exercises and the lack of intense or relaxing cues don't prominently align with those categories."
