  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to explicit references to nature and exploration in the title and description. The phrase 'Explore the Gulf of Alaska as you row towards the Aialik Glacier' indicates a rowing session in a natural setting, aligning well with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' category. This spirit is given a high score of 0.9, as the workout clearly involves outdoor scenery and an adventurous journey. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is moderately applicable, with a score of 0.4, due to the potential for rhythmic rowing, often present in journey-style workouts like this, which can feature continuous and smooth motions. The lack of specific intensity indicators and a focus on exploration rather than structured training excludes 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' categories from being suitable."
