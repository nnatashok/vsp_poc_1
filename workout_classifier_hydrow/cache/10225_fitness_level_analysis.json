  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is classified as a 'drive' workout, which is characterized by a challenging pace and technique demands. Despite a rowing category, the 'Drive' designation indicates a higher technical challenge due to the emphasis on maintaining precise form and control at higher intensity and split reduction. The metadata describes an 18-minute session focused on gradual intensity increases which aligns with advanced coordination and technique, warranting a strong advanced score.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is notably intense, labeled as a 'Drive' with maximal rhythm at 30 and an intensity rating of 3 out of 3, indicating significant physical exertion. The workout's duration of nearly 20 minutes further contributes to this demand. While 'Challenging' describes typical steady, vigorous workouts, the crescendo of intensity to a personal test matches elements of 'Extreme', though slightly less extreme due to its duration. Therefore, it fits challenging to extreme.",
