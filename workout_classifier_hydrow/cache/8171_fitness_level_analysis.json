Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session duration is just over 20 minutes, which suggests moderate duration. The descriptors focus on tension release, a likely slower-paced and less intense session with possibly restorative benefits typical of a 'flow'. The music is downtempo, supporting a more relaxed intensity. These circumstances align best with a Light effort difficulty, possibly challenging at higher durations or intensity levels, but not in this instance.",
