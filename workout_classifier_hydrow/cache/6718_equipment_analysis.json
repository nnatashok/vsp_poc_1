The high confidence score for the mat (0.9) is because mats are typically essential for yoga practices to provide comfort and support during poses. Additionally, the image shows yoga blocks next to the mat, which are often used in yoga for support and to achieve correct alignment, giving them a high confidence score of 0.8. Although the equipment field is empty, the context and image strongly suggest the use of these items."
