  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 15 minutes and being part of the 'journeys' type, the workout likely emphasizes endurance rather than high intensity, making it accessible. The lack of high-intensity cues or specified intensity in the description suggests a moderate energy expenditure, likely light for deconditioned individuals, but can edge into moderate during more sustained or faster rowing periods.",
