  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'The Power of Positivity Row' is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.9 due to the Workout intensity level being 3 out of 3, and the interval format featuring 2-minute and 1-minute intervals, which suggests a challenging and high-intensity session. The inclusion of rock and global hits further implies an energetic environment.\n\nThe second classification is 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.85, supported by the visual evidence of rowing being performed on a river, highlighting the outdoor and exploration aspect of the workout.\n\nLastly, 'Structured & Disciplined' is also relevant with a score of 0.7 due to the structured interval format (2-minute and 1-minute intervals) and the focus on consistency mentioned in the description. The clear organization of intervals indicates a disciplined approach.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the lack of emphasis on smoothness, relaxation, or recovery in the metadata."
