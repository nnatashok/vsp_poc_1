  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Technique Cool-Down\" clearly fits a \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit due to its focus on cooling down, indicated by 'cool down' in the workout name and description, and relaxed music genres like Blues/Jazz. The importance of reinforcing technique suggests a \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit, evident from the 'Format: Technique' and the methodical approach implied. The use of a rowing environment, as shown in the image, aligns with an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit, albeit less strongly, as it leverages a natural setting for the session. The title and description imply a controlled and gentle approach, positioning it as less intense and more reflective. Indicators supporting this include the low rhythm and cool music genre. While the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit is suggested by music and rowing, it is less emphasized. Thus, \"Soothing & Restorative\" leads with high confidence, complemented by structured elements and an outdoor component."
