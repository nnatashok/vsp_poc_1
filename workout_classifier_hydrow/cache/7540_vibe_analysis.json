  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Cardio Control Row' emphasizes controlling your split and maintaining rhythms, which suggests a focus on repetition and endurance, aligning well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The use of the terms 'cardio-focused' and 'steady format' support this, as it indicates a calmer, endurance-based session. The music played includes energetic tracks such as 'Mama (Club Mix)' and 'Slow Acid,' suggesting a rhythmic and engaging atmosphere, which partially fits 'The Groove Session' vibe. However, the low intensity and steady format limit how much it aligns with high-energy vibes. The confidence level is set to 0.75 because of clear indicators of steady cardio with rhythmic elements, supported by dance and global hits playlist."
