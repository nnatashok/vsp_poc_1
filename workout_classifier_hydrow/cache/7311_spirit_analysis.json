  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Proper Technique Cool-Down\" largely embodies the \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit with a score of 0.75. This is evident from the emphasis on proper technique and drills mentioned in the description, indicating methodical and precision-focused practices. Furthermore, the title and category 'Cool Down' suggest a structured approach to finishing a workout properly.\n\nAdditionally, the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit is relevant with a score of 0.65, as the workout type is a 'cool down', which inherently suggests a gentle, restorative phase at the end of a rigorous workout, aimed at aiding recovery and relaxation.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is moderately present with a score of 0.4. The rowing activity seems to occur outdoors, given the image of rowing in a natural setting, albeit it is not a significant aspect of the workout spirit's focus. The calming music playlist (Indie Alternative, Global Hits) further aligns with the soothing nature, not adventure.\n\nOther spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Sport & Agility\" were not applicable due to the mellow and technique-focused nature of the session, while \"Flow & Rhythm\" was not prominent as the focus is more on drills than seamless flow."
