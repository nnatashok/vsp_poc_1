  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video 'Heat Building Flow' has features that align well with 'The Groove Session' vibe. The description mentions a 'fast paced flow,' which suggests a fun, fluid, and expressive quality, scoring it a 0.7. The music playlist supports this vibe with tracks like 'waves - Tame Impala Remix,' known for its rhythmic and captivating beats. \n\n'Flow' in the workout type and the presence of songs characterized by chill and downtempo genres hint towards a meditative and repetitive nature, aligning with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, thus scoring a 0.6.\n\nFinally, the workout is done 'on the mat' without equipment, indicative of a calming and intentional practice, suitable for 'The Zen Flow.' However, due to the fast pace, this vibe is secondary, scoring a 0.4. The confidence in selecting these vibes is high due to clear indicators in the description and song selection."
