  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Core Burn Express' is classified primarily under 'Structured & Disciplined' due to its specific focus on strengthening the core and being described as a structured Pilates routine, which typically follows methodical movement patterns. The short duration emphasizes efficiency and precision, supporting a disciplined approach. This classification is given a score of 0.75 for its strong match to this spirit.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' also fits as the workout is visibly set in an outdoor location by the sea in Gloucester, MA. The scenic outdoor setting and the mat-based setup align with exploration and nature-based exercise principles, scoring it 0.7.\n\nLastly, 'Flow & Rhythm' is relevant since Pilates often incorporates smooth, connected movements. The music playlist featuring R&B and global hits likely enhances a sense of rhythm and connection in the session. This spirit, however, is less strongly represented, resulting in a score of 0.6.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded as the workout does not indicate extreme intensity or a focus on relaxation."
