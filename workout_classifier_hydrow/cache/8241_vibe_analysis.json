  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Side Body + Twists Align' involves gentle twists and is described as being suitable for a gloomy day, indicating a relaxing and mild session, characteristic of 'The Zen Flow'. The presence of soothing music genres like down-tempo complements this vibe, supporting a calm, grounding experience. This assigns a score of 0.8 for a strong match.\n\nThe short duration of 11 minutes and focus on lengthening and twists also aligns with 'The Reboot Workout', aiming for a gentle reset or refresh, suggesting elements of a re-energizing session. The optional use of yoga blocks suggests accessibility and ease. Therefore, this vibe is assigned a score of 0.6 for a good match.\n\nThe absence of intense music or workout challenges helps exclude more high-energy vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush'. The limited indicators result in a moderate confidence level of 0.75."
