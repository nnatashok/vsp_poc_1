  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'row' which, according to platform-specific rules, usually aligns with Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty. The description '4-minute intervals' and the use of the term 'dynamic workouts' suggest slightly more than basic rowing but nothing overly complex. The movements involved in rowing itself are generally straightforward, hence aligning with Beginner (0.8) and partly with Intermediate (0.7) levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 11:35 minutes and the format 'Interval' suggest some level of exertion, potentially challenging for deconditioned users. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 and use of 'sweat' indicates a moderate effort (0.7). The climb format suggests a progression that could make it feel partially Challenging (0.4) for lower fitness users. Additionally, upbeat music genres such as Rock Mid-intensity support a moderate to challenging effort level.",
