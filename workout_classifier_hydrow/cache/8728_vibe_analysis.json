  "vibesExplanation": "The workout features a fast-paced circuit format with a 2-minute row and a lunge and cardio circuit, indicating a competitive and intense environment, typical of 'The Competitor' vibe. The high-energy dance and global hits playlist suggest an upbeat, nightclub-like atmosphere, fitting 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe. The combination of dumbbells and rowing, along with the explosive nature of EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute) format, supports the competitive edge. The absence of a specified instructor allows the music to set a lively tone, reinforcing the nightclub ambience. Overall, the metadata supports a mix of competitive and rhythmic, party-like vibes."
