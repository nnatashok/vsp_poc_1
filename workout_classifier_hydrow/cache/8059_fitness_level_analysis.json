  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is classified as 'breathe', which suggests a focus on relaxation and breathing techniques rather than complex rowing drills. The category 'row' typically aligns with beginner or intermediate technique difficulty due to the straightforward nature of rowing. Given the interval format which can add some complexity, there is a minor alignment with Intermediate, but strong alignment (0.8) with Beginner given the relaxation theme indicated in 'Creating Space'.",
