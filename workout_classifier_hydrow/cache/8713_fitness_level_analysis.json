  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given that the workout primarily involves rowing with an interval format and a max rhythm of 28, the technique difficulty can be classified as either Beginner or Intermediate. Rowing itself is not complex, aligning closely with Beginner level, scoring 0.8, as it involves repetitive and straightforward movements. The Intermediate score of 0.7 aligns due to the interval format which requires more coordination, increasing technical difficulty slightly. The technique confidence is high at 0.9 because the straightforward nature of rowing aligns with the metadata indicators.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves a 31-minute session with an interval format, described with a workout intensity level of 2 out of 3. This suggests significant energy expenditure and sustained effort, making the effort difficulty score a 0.7 for Moderate and a 0.6 for Challenging. The use of music genres hints at maintaining a steady pace, but the interval workout type usually requires bursts of higher effort, hence the Challenging score. The confidence is relatively high at 0.85 given the clarity on intensity and format markers.",
