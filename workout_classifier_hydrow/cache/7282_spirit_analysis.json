  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Newport Harbor Stern View' with the description 'Explore Newport Harbor on a cloudy day' strongly suggests an Outdoor & Adventure spirit. The use of the word 'Explore' indicates an element of journeying and experiencing an outdoor environment. Additionally, the 'Workout Type' is listed as 'journey' and is categorized under 'Journeys', which further emphasizes the exploratory and environmental component. Since rowing sessions recorded on rivers are explicitly classified under Outdoor & Adventure, it's appropriate to assign a high score to this spirit. No indications point towards any intense, structured, or soothing components; therefore, those spirits are excluded. The confidence level is high due to multiple clear indicators of outdoor exploration in the metadata."
