  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Standing Posture Align\" emphasizes alignment and posture improvement, indicative of a \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit. The description specifically mentions conducting this yoga session in the \"snowy mountains in New Hampshire,\" a strong indicator for an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit due to the natural and unique setting. The absence of vigorous activity references and a focus on alignment suggests it is not a high-energy or structured session. Music genres like chill and downtempo support the restorative aspect, providing a relaxed atmosphere. The playful and popular nature of songs listed in the playlist may add a light-hearted element, further reinforcing the soothing vibe. Thus, \"Outdoor & Adventure\" is rated at 0.9, strongly evident from the outdoor snowy setting, and \"Soothing & Restorative\" at 0.7, due to the yoga alignment focus and music choice."
