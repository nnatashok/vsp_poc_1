  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Power Climb Row' workout primarily embodies the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the rowing session being conducted on the Charles River, as indicated by the description and the image showing an outdoor environment. This setting emphasizes nature-based exercise, which is a key aspect of the spirit, earning a score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the workout fits the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The description mentions 'stroke-based intervals' and categorizes the workout as 'sweat,' indicating a moderately intense session that aims to elevate heart rates and push physical limits, which aligns with the given intensity level of 2 out of 3. This warrants a score of 0.7 in this category.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit could be a mild fit due to the presence of a rhythmic element with rowing, but there is insufficient evidence to emphasize flow or rhythmic continuity strongly, so it's excluded from the primary classification. Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were not considered as they don't match the described dynamic and intensity level of the session."
