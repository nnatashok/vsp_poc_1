  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Reverse Climb Cool-Down' workout is characterized by a relaxed, low-intensity session, ideal for recovery and enjoyment. The focus on 'cool down' and 'steady cruise' indicates a vibe fitting 'The Reboot Workout,' which centers around easing tension and refreshing the body (score: 0.8). The 'Meditative Grind' is also represented, as the rowing format often involves repetitive, calming motions, especially with the scenic aspect of cruising in Los Angeles (score: 0.6). 'The Endorphin Wave' is considered due to the positive emotional music from popular and global hits providing a feel-good, elevated mood (score: 0.4). The absence of an instructor and specific structure leaned away from more guided or intense vibes."
