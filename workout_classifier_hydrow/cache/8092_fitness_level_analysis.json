  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 15 minutes long, focusing on postural and upper body strengthening. This indicates a Moderate level of effort difficulty. The use of resistance bands suggests low energy expenditure relative to free weights or advanced circuit training. Thus it fits a Light effort difficulty score of 0.4 and more strongly aligns with Moderate at 0.6 due to potential intensity from band tension.",
