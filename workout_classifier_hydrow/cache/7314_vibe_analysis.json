  "vibesExplanation": "The \"Progression Training Row\" suggests a focus on incremental improvement, aligning well with \"The Progression Quest\" vibe, which emphasizes methodical, long-term enhancement. The inclusion of interval training ('5 and 10-minute intervals') combined with a climb format indicates a structured, progression-oriented workout, justifying a 0.7 score here. \n\nThe vibe \"The Meditative Grind\" is supported by the workout's repetitive and steady nature ('row'), combined with moderate intensity (1 out of 3). The dance and global hits playlist featuring songs by artists like Dua Lipa and Calvin Harris adds a rhythmic element, reinforcing the meditative aspect, thus earning a 0.75 score.\n\n\"The Endorphin Wave\" is also applicable due to the feel-good music selection and steady build of energy from interval rowing. This vibe captures the elevated energy and positive movement experience described, meriting a score of 0.65. The confidence level is moderate to high (0.75) due to clear indicators in the workout's structure and music choices."
