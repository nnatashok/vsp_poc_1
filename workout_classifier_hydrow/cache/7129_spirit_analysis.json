  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a high score of 0.9. This is due to the description indicating the session takes place in downtown Seville, Spain, and the image confirms the outdoor rowing setting. \n\n'High-Energy & Intense' is assigned a score of 0.7, supported by terms like 'Energizing' and 'sweat,' along with pop and global hit music that typically accompanies vigorous activities. The format also includes interval training, pointing to a fast-paced and intense session.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' receives a score of 0.6 because the workout is broken into three 10-minute segments focusing on building speed, power, and endurance. This indicates a methodical approach and technical structure.\n\nOther spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Flow & Rhythm' are not applicable due to the focus on intensity and interval training, rather than gentle or continuous mind-body movement."
