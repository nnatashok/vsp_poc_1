  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'HIIT Row' is classified with high confidence as 'The Warrior Workout' due to several strong indicators of intensity and primal energy: the use of high-intensity interval training (\"HIIT\"), a maximum rhythm of 30+, and designating intensity level 3 out of 3. These elements align closely with a sweat-dripping, heart-pounding experience. The 'Nightclub Workout' vibe is moderately present, supported by the information that dance genres and upbeat, remix-heavy playlists are used in the session, inferring a lively and euphoric atmosphere. 'The Competitor' vibe is detected with moderate confidence; the presence of a competitive element is ambiguous but inferred from terms related to splits and sprints, which may suggest a performance-focused session. Overall, these elements point towards an engaging, energetic experience."
