  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Lake Las Vegas Stern View', description, and category explicitly indicate that this is a rowing session, as evidenced by phrases like 'row along Lake Las Vegas'. Additionally, the workout type is 'journey', and the category includes 'row', both of which further confirm the central role of rowing. The absence of any mention of other equipment or exercises suggests that a rowing machine is the primary or sole equipment needed. Given the strong emphasis and repeated references to rowing, a high confidence score of 0.9 is warranted for the inclusion of a rowing machine."
