  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which strongly indicates the need for a rowing machine, as confirmed by the guideline for such a category. The description 'Drive through your legs with Aisyah during intervals at low rhythms' also implies rowing motions commonly performed on a rowing machine. The inclusion of terms such as 'rhythm' and 'interval' further supports this inference, typical of rowing workouts. Therefore, a rowing machine is required with very high confidence."
