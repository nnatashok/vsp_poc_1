  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Stag Row' involves rowing intervals with a laid-back narrative involving bachelor party stories, suggesting a casual and engaging vibe. The interval format combined with classic hits like 'Everybody Wants To Rule The World' indicates a steady, rhythmic energy, aligning with 'The Meditative Grind' due to the repetitive nature of rowing (score: 0.7). \n\nThe upbeat and nostalgic playlist featuring 'Come On Eileen' and 'Jack & Diane' adds a fun and engaging element, aligning with 'The Groove Session' (score: 0.5). While not dance-oriented, the enjoyment from storytelling and music creates a similar expressive atmosphere.\n\nFinally, the music with rock and global hits, though not specified as high-intensity, combined with a social narrative could slightly evoke a 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe due to the casual social setting and engaging music (score: 0.3). The workout lacks extreme intensity, which is why it leans more towards relaxed and rhythmic vibes."
