  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Stay Steady Together Row' and category 'row' strongly indicate that a rowing machine is central to the workout, leading to a very high confidence score. The description emphasizes maintaining rowing rhythms, which is directly associated with using a rowing machine. Although the image shows outdoor rowing, the metadata, specifically the category and workout type ('row'), align with indoor rowing, typically requiring a rowing machine."
