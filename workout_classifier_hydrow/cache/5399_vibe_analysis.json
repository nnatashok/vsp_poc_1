  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Firestarter' with a high score of 0.8 due to the focus on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with short, explosive bursts of rowing at high rhythms (26-32). The intense nature and the maximal intensity level (3 out of 3) further support this vibe. The name 'Need for Speed Row' implies a fast-paced and powerful workout, characteristic of this vibe.\n\nThe secondary vibe of 'The Nightclub Workout' is also a strong fit with a score of 0.7 due to the music playlist including dance and hit tracks such as 'Levels' by Avicii and 'Flames' by R3HAB, which are upbeat and evocative of a nightclub atmosphere. The mention of radio stations like 'Dance high' aligns with this vibe, adding a music-infused and energetic feel to the workout session.\n\nThe confidence level for these classifications is high due to the clear indicators in both the workout description and music selection."
