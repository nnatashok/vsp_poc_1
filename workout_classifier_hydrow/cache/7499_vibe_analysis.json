  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily a stretching routine designed for after running, indicated by its title and description. This aligns it closely with 'The Reboot Workout,' which focuses on deep stretch and total-body refresh (score: 0.8). The absence of demanding physical intensity and the mention of yoga blocks suggest a grounding element, supporting 'The Zen Flow' vibe (score: 0.6). The music playlist featuring dance and global hits injects a feel-good energy typical of 'The Endorphin Wave' (score: 0.4), though this is less central given the workout's focus on stretching and recovery. The outdoor setting overlooking Dublin adds a refreshing and meditative quality, confirming these vibe selections."
