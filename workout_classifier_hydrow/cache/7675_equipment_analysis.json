  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and is a 'cool down' session, which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. While the description mentions a technical cool-down led by Sera Moon to perfect posture at the finish, it aligns with rowing techniques. The presence of the rowing machine is further affirmed by the image, which depicts rowing equipment in a natural setting, reinforcing the need for a rowing machine. The confidence score is high due to the explicit categorization and thematic emphasis on rowing."
