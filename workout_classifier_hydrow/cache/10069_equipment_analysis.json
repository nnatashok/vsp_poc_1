  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Big Effort Row,\" and falls under the category of \"row,\" making it explicit that a rowing machine is central to this workout. The description mentions rowing intervals and highlights the instructor's extensive rowing experience, further supporting that the primary activity involves a rowing machine. Given that it's a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) row workout, the rowing machine is essential to perform the workout effectively and aligns with the metadata categorization of 'row'. Therefore, the confidence score for including a rowing machine is very high at 1.0, as it is both explicitly required and central to the workout."
