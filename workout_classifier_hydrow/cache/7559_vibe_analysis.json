  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Masterclass Workout' with a score of 0.75. This is due to its focus on core engagement through Pilates, which is technique-driven and skill-building. The use of the term 'beginner' indicates a focus on foundational skills, typical of a masterclass vibe. Furthermore, the 15-minute duration suggests a session focused on learning and precision rather than endurance.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Groove Session' is also relevant, with a score of 0.7, as the playlist includes Hip Hop/R&B and Global Hits, creating a rhythmic and expressive atmosphere. Songs like 'In Da Club' and 'Sexy Love' contribute to a fun and expressive workout vibe. The upbeat music contrasts the typical serene Pilates session, adding an element of groove into the practice.\n\nOther vibes were considered but excluded, as the primary focus on technique and the specific music choice best matched these vibes. The vibe confidence is set at 0.75 due to the clear indicators in the workout type and music playlist."
