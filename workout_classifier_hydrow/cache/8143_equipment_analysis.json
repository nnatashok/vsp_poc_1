  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as 'Beginner Bodyweight Strength' with 'bodyweight exercises', indicating no additional equipment like weights or machines is needed. The category 'On The Mat' strongly suggests the use of a mat for comfort and support during exercises performed on the floor. Additionally, the image shows participants standing on mats. Therefore, a mat is identified as required with very high confidence (0.9). No other equipment is mentioned or implied, reinforcing the focus on bodyweight exercises."
