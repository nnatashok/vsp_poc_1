  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Just Go Row' with a format of HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) clearly indicates a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as it involves short bursts of high-intensity activity. The session is designed to challenge participants to hit new speeds, further reinforcing the intense, heart-pumping nature of the workout. This is scored at 0.85 due to strong explicit mentions of intensity and challenge in the metadata.\\n\\nAdditionally, the mention of max rhythm and structured format implies elements of 'Structured & Disciplined', as participants are following a specific protocol with an emphasis on technique and progression. This is supported by the instructor's professional background and the competitive pacing involves, assigning it a score of 0.7.\\n\\n'Flow & Rhythm' is considered due to the music element (90's and Global Hits radio) which may involve rhythm-based rowing sessions, important for connection in a workout. However, this aspect is less emphasized in the metadata, leading to a lower score of 0.3.\\n\\nOther spirits were not selected due to lack of emphasis on recovery, agility, outdoor settings, or a soothing nature in the description and context of the workout."
