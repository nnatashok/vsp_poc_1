  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the 30-minute duration and focus on a combination of flowing yoga and restorative poses, the workout is likely to be low in energy expenditure, aligning with the Light effort difficulty level (score: 0.6). The flow portion may increase heart rate slightly, suggesting some elements of Moderate effort (score: 0.4). The music playlist, described as chill and downtempo, matches a more relaxed session, reinforcing the light to moderate intensity. The restorative aspect usually involves minimal physical exertion, further supporting the primary alignment with Light intensity.",
