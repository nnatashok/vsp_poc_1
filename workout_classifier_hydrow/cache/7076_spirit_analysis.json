  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is characterized by elements of both 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure'. The term 'Cardio Climb Row' and the emphasis on rhythmic climbing every five minutes suggest a focus on smooth, coordinated movements, aligning with 'Flow & Rhythm' (score: 0.7). The specific mention of rhythm and music-driven playlists further supports this classification.\n\nThe workout's setting in Long Beach, California, along with the provided image depicting rowing on water, strongly indicates an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.8). The natural environment amplifies the exploration and enjoyment of nature, which is central to this spirit.\n\nThe intensity level of 1 supports a moderate flow and exploratory focus rather than high intensity or structure, reinforcing the chosen spirits. Other spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined', are excluded due to the low intensity and rhythmic, relaxed pacing outlined in the metadata."
