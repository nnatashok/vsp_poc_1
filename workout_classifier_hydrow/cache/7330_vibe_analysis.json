  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Get to Know Your Team Row' features elements that align with 'The Meditative Grind.' The format 'cardio' and the rowing duration of 16 minutes suggests a repetitive and rhythmic experience, earning a score of 0.7. The music playlist, which includes Latin tracks such as 'El Amante' and 'Morado,' indicates a lively, engaging environment, characteristic of 'The Groove Session,' thus warranting a 0.65 score. The inclusion of dynamic Latin tracks also contributes to a feel-good, elevated energy suitable for 'The Endorphin Wave,' albeit less prominently, hence a moderate score of 0.5. The low intensity level and focus on music and community learning suggest a meditative but engaging experience without the intense elements of other categories."
