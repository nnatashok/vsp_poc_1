  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Core Strength' is primarily focused on developing core muscles, indicative of a structured approach to fitness. The term 'strength' suggests methodical and disciplined exercises rather than spontaneous or high-intensity activity, aligning with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The presence of a mat and lack of specified equipment further supports this classification, as it likely involves controlled bodyweight exercises typical of a structured workout routine. This is given a strong score of 0.75.\n\nMusic from the 90's and Global Hits, although unspecified in its influence, typically supports rhythm and flow, hence a 'Flow & Rhythm' classification is also relevant, albeit with a moderate score of 0.6, due to potential music-driven pacing helping in maintaining consistent movement.\n\nThe lack of specific keywords related to high intensity, recovery, sports training, or outdoor elements weakens other spirits\u2019 relevance. The location indoors on a mat further excludes 'Outdoor & Adventure.' Overall, the structured and rhythmic nature of the workout leads to the chosen spirits."
