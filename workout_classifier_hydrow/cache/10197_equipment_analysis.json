  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description explicitly mentions rowing intervals, which necessitates the use of a rowing machine. Given the high importance of the rowing component in the workout (confidence 0.9), this equipment is essential. Additionally, the description highlights 'on-the-mat moves,' indicating the use of a mat with high confidence (0.8). Dumbbells are specifically mentioned in both the description and the equipment metadata, confirming their requirement for exercises like bicep curls and dumbbell press-outs, also with high confidence (0.8). The workout's structure and the presence of these exercises strongly suggest that all three pieces of equipment are central to completing the workout effectively."
