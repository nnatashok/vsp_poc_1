  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short, slightly over 10 minutes, which indicates a low energy expenditure session. As it is strength-focused with no mention of high-intensity intervals or heavy lifting, it leans towards light exertion. However, working on muscles like abductors and adductors may require some sustained, moderate effort, which elevates the difficulty to a potential moderate level for users with low fitness.",
