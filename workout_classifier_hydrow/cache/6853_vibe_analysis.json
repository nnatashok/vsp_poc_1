  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is a beginner-friendly Pilates session, which strongly aligns it with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe due to its focus on technique, skill-building, and foundational development. The score of 0.75 reflects the workout's emphasis on learning Pilates fundamentals. While the music genre isn't specified, the presence of remixes and popular dance tracks ('Wild Things (Young Bombs Remix)', 'What I Did For Love (Vinai Remix)'), support a 'Groove Session' vibe, involving fluid, expressive movements set to rhythmic sounds. This vibe is given a score of 0.6 because the musical elements suggest a fun and somewhat immersive experience, even though the primary focus is skill development."
