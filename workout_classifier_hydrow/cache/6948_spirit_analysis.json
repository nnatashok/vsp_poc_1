  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Steep Climb Row\" is classified primarily under the \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit with a strong score of 0.9. This is due to the use of HIIT format, mention of sprints (\"2', 1', and 30\" sprints\"), and maximum rhythm of 34, combined with a high intensity level setting of 3 out of 3. The playlist, featuring upbeat and energetic tracks like \"You & Me (Flume Remix)\" and \"Don't Let Me Down (W&W Remix),\" further emphasizes this high-intensity characteristic.\n\nThe spirit \"Outdoor & Adventure\" scores 0.8, supported by the imagery depicting rowing on a river and the natural outdoor setting. This aligns with the metadata, providing a sense of exploration and engagement with the environment.\n\nThe \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit has a moderate score of 0.5, inferred from the concept of reaching high rhythms and the role of dance music tracks which suggest coordination and a music-driven pace.\n\n\"Structured & Disciplined\" and \"Soothing & Restorative\" were excluded due to the focus on intensity and high energy. \"Sport & Agility\" is not emphasized, though present indirectly through the athletic nature of the activity."
