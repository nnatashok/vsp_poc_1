  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Ready to Race Warm-Up', and the description mentions it takes place on the Charles River, which suggests a rowing-themed routine. Moreover, the category includes 'row', which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine, particularly given that the instructor is described as Singapore\u2019s first Olympic rower, emphasizing her rowing expertise. These indicators provide a very high confidence (0.9) that a rowing machine is required equipment for this workout. No other equipment is suggested by the metadata."
