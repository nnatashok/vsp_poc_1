The \"Introducing Buffy Row\" title indicates an introductory nature, which suggests a simplicity suitable for Beginners. The description emphasizes a practical and relatable approach, supporting a score towards Beginner. However, the involvement of a high-energy workout as led by an Olympian adds a slight Intermediate aspect, leading to scores of 0.7 for Beginner and 0.5 for Intermediate.",
