Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 'HIIT Strength' workout is described as raising your heart rate, which implies a significant level of physical exertion typical for HIIT routines. The duration of 20:38 suggests a sustained effort, especially with typical HIIT short rest periods and high intensity sets. Even for a user with lower fitness capabilities, the combination of strength focus and HIIT design positions this as particularly demanding, hence aligning strongly with a Challenging effort level (0.8). Moderate level (0.2) could apply for users already at the upper Beginner to Intermediate transition.",
