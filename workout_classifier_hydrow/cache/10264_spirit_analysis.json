  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout strongly matches the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as indicated by phrases like 'competitive spirit,' 'pushing your limits,' 'bring your everything,' and 'leave it all on the water.' The workout is described as a 'drive' with an intensity level of 3 out of 3, reinforcing this spirit. The metadata mentions racing, strategic moves, and a high rhythm, further supporting an intense nature. The 'Sport & Agility' spirit is highly relevant due to the focus on racing, competition, and strategic moves associated with sport-specific skills, confirmed by the background of the instructor as an Olympian. Lastly, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is appropriate given the session takes place on the Charles River, classifying it as a nature-based workout, though it scores slightly lower due to the primarily competitive focus rather than exploration. The exclusion of 'Flow & Rhythm' is due to the race's emphasis on competition rather than smooth continuity, and 'Soothing & Restorative' is not relevant due to its high intensity and competitive nature."
