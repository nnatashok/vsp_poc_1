  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Steady Speed Row' has strong indicators of 'The Meditative Grind' as it involves a rhythmic, steady rowing activity. The keywords 'steady' and 'standard' suggest a repetitive and consistent motion that encourages focus and endurance over time, fitting the description of zoning in and locking down into a repetitive activity. The low intensity level (1 out of 3) reinforces this vibe.\n\n'Zen Flow' is supported by the elements of breath and a relaxed, low-intensity workout. The description emphasizes 'breathe' and 'exploring,' which implies a mindful and grounding experience, albeit slightly less dominant than the meditative aspect.\n\nThe 'Explorer's Workout' vibe is indicated by the mention of 'exploring Bergen' and the scenic rowing image, which suggests an adventure or outdoor challenge. The global music adds an immersive, world-traveling element, although this is less pronounced compared to the other vibes."
