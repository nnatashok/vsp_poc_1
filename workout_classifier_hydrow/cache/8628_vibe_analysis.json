Additionally, the 'Endorphin Wave' is a moderate match, considering the feel-good energy from the pop hits in the playlist, which could elevate the mood during the workout. The overall combination of elements provides a reflective yet enjoyable experience, conducive to engendering a positive mindset and gradual endurance building, justifying the chosen vibe scores."
