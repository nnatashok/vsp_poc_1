  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is aptly classified under \"Flow & Rhythm\" due to the title \"Core Flow\" and description mentioning a \"heat-building flow,\" which indicates a continuous, coordinated movement routine. The presence of a yoga block also suggests an emphasis on controlled and harmonious exercises. The music playlist, featuring chill and downtempo tracks, further emphasizes a rhythmic and flowing workout environment with scores like 'Nightcall (Breakbot Remix)' and 'I Got U'. Consequently, this spirit is rated at 0.9 due to these strong indicators.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is relevant because the image shows an outdoor setting by the water. Although it's primarily a mat-based workout, the environment enhances the adventurous aspect, which is rare for an on-the-mat session, thus a score of 0.75 signifies this connection. Other spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Soothing & Restorative\" were less applicable due to the indicated balanced and flowing nature of the workout without an explicit high-energy or calming focus."
