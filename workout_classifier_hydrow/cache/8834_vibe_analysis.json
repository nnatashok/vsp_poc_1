  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled \"Big Climb Row\" is a 31-minute rowing session designed to build endurance, moving towards a big climb in rhythm and effort. The focus on endurance and the rhythmic nature of a climbing format strongly aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, which is characterized by repetitive, zone-in workouts like rowing. These elements are underscored by the calm, developmental intent of the workout, emphasizing a repeated and focused effort, leading to a high confidence (score: 0.9) in this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, the use of \"Pop low, Global Hits\" music suggests an uplifting, feel-good environment, which complements the enduring and steady aspects of 'The Endorphin Wave.' The emphasis on feeling great, as described in the instructor's approach, further supports this vibe. While the intensity is low, the positive energy and rhythm contribute to a moderate confidence (score: 0.65) for this vibe. The absence of high intensity and explosive elements excludes vibes like 'The Firestarter' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.'"
