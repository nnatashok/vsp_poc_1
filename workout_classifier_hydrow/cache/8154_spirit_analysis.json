  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Chicago River Stern View' is titled and described as a journey along the Chicago River, indicating a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The mention of navigating a river aligns with the environmental exploration aspect of this spirit, and the setting being outdoors further supports this classification. Based on the description, this spirit was given a high score of 0.95.\n\nAdditionally, since rowing sessions often involve steady, rhythmic movements, there is an inherent element of 'Flow & Rhythm' in this activity. The journey aspect also suggests continuous motion, matching the qualities of this spirit. Therefore, a moderate score of 0.6 has been assigned to 'Flow & Rhythm'.\n\nThe absence of explicit mentions of high intensity, recovery focus, or technical structuring indicates that other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Soothing & Restorative', or 'Structured & Disciplined' do not apply. Overall, the confidence level in this classification is high due to clear evidence from the available metadata."
