Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the duration of 21 minutes and the classification as a 'journey', the workout presents a sustained cardio session more focused on endurance rather than intensity or energy expenditure spikes typical of high-intensity sessions. It lacks specific intensity cues that suggest a high physical demand, aligning the effort requirement closer to Moderate. However, for less conditioned users, the sustained effort might represent more challenge than for fit users, thus the Light to Moderate classification.",
