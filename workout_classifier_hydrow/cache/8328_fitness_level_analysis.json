Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Peppy Warm-Up' has a short duration of 5:38 and is designated specifically as a warm-up, which are typically low-intensity exercises aimed at preparing the body without causing significant fatigue. Therefore, it strongly aligns with Light Effort Difficulty. However, the interval format does add a slight intensity boost (reflected as Moderate), but due to the session's purpose as a warm-up, this is not dominant. Thus, Light receives the highest score, with confidence in this classification being very high due to clear metadata cues.",
