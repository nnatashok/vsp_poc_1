  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Speed Builder Row' focuses on high-intensity intervals (2-minute and 1-minute) which aligns well with 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its short, explosive nature, scoring 0.7. The interval format combined with rowing suggests sustained, repetitive effort, which fits 'The Meditative Grind', scoring 0.6, as these can tune into the rhythm and repetition of rowing. Although the intensity is level 2 out of 3, the music playlist ('Drivers License', 'Big Energy') provides an energetic and feel-good atmosphere, contributing to 'The Endorphin Wave', but less prominently, with a score of 0.4. This combination creates a balanced mix of explosive intervals and steady rowing, but the differentiating factor is the interval focus which is more aligned with explosive workout vibes. The confidence level is high at 0.75 due to clear indicators in the metadata, but some subjective interpretation of rowing's meditative aspects exists."
