Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as Moderate, reflecting the workout's 21-minute duration and the inclusion of a yoga flow, which typically involves sustained and flowing movement. The music genre, described as Chill and Downtempo, suggests a less intense pace, hence a partial alignment with Light difficulty. However, the term 'Power Flow' inherently hints at a more vigorous practice than traditional gentle yoga, leading to a stronger Moderate classification.",
