  "vibesExplanation": "The workout \"Yoga for Sleep\" is primarily classified as \"The Sleep Prep\" with a strong score of 0.9. The title and description explicitly mention preparing for sleep and winding down, which is the core characteristic of the Sleep Prep vibe. The short duration of 6 minutes and 5 seconds further supports the intention of being a short, calming session designed for bedtime.\n\nThe secondary vibe is \"The Deep Recharge,\" with a score of 0.7. The description emphasizes restoring the body, and combined with \"Chill low, Cool/Downtempo\" music, it suggests a gentle, restorative focus aimed at nervous system reset.\n\nOther vibes were considered but excluded due to lack of intensity or specific movement focus that defines their characteristics, making Sleep Prep and Deep Recharge the most fitting choices."
