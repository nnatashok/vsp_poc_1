  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is categorized as 'drive', which according to Hydrow-specific rules typically suggests a higher technique difficulty, aligning most closely with Intermediate. Instructor Nick emphasizes proper form and the drive category involves more coordinated movements, although it's not listed beyond row, meaning significant complexity is unlikely. The high rhythm (max 32) suggests a need for coordination but not advanced complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described to 'ignite your legs and lungs', with the highest intensity level of 3 out of 3, indicating a significant physical demand. With a duration of over 11 minutes, the drive and climb formats likely involve sustained exertion. The use of high-energy music genres further suggests a fast-paced, energy-intensive workout, aligning with Challenging effort difficulty.",
