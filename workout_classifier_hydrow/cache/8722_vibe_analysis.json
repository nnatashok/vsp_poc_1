  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Endurance Building Row' with a focus on maintaining a 'steady effort' suggests a sustained, repetitive activity, aligning well with 'The Meditative Grind.' This is supported by the duration (31 minutes 43 seconds) and the low-to-moderate intensity level (1 out of 3), which indicates a more zen-like, consistent row, rather than high intensity. The 'interval' format adds a slight element of change within the consistency, enhancing this vibe (score: 0.75).\n\nThe music playlist, featuring upbeat and nostalgic hits from artists like Vanessa Carlton and Jonas Brothers, promotes a feel-good environment typical of 'The Endorphin Wave.' This complements the smooth, continuous exertion of an endurance rowing session that builds up a gradual sense of accomplishment and emotional uplift (score: 0.6).\n\nWhile the interval format could hint at more dynamic vibes like 'The Endorphin Wave,' the overall evidence points more strongly towards structured endurance than explosive movement, hence excluding options like 'The Warrior Workout.'"
