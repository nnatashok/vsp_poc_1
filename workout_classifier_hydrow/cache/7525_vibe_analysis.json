  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is focused on stress relief and relaxation, as indicated by its title 'Stress Relief Cool-Down.' The description emphasizes technique, relaxing shoulders, and maintaining posture, which aligns with calming physical activity. The use of chill and downtempo music reinforces a relaxing atmosphere typical of a 'Reboot Workout,' concentrating on gentle movement and low stress. The short duration of just under six minutes also suggests a quick mental and physical refresh, consistent with 'The Deep Recharge.' Furthermore, the steady format and emphasis on technique can fit 'The Zen Flow,' emphasizing breath-centered and grounding elements. The absence of a high intensity or competitive aspect excludes vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.' Overall, the metadata conveys a strong theme of calm and relaxation, leading to high confidence in the chosen vibes."
