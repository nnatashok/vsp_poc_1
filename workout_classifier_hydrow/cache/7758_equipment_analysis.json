  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Endurance Intervals Row,' and falls under the 'row' category, indicating a rowing-focused session. The description mentions 2-minute climbing intervals, a common structure in rowing workouts aimed at building endurance and intensity. Although the equipment section is empty, the context strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. The image accompanying the metadata further supports this, showing a person on a rowing machine. Given these factors, the confidence score for including a rowing machine is very high at 1.0."
