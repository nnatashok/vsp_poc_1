  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Club 26 Row\" embodies multiple spirits based on the available metadata: \n\n1. **Flow & Rhythm (0.75)**: The title and description focus on finding and maintaining a rhythm, with an emphasis on pacing and intervals. This suggests a smooth, continuous movement pattern typical of a Flow & Rhythm spirit. The use of indie and global hits also suggests a music-driven pacing.\n\n2. **Outdoor & Adventure (0.7)**: The image shows rowing in a natural, outdoor environment, supporting the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. This setting, combined with the rowing activity on water, aligns with leveraging environmental challenges.\n\n3. **Structured & Disciplined (0.65)**: The mention of \"intervals\" and a steady format suggests a methodical approach to training, with an emphasis on technical precision and discipline.\n\nThe intensity level is moderate, which supports a balanced emphasis across these spirits. The sporty setting and rhythm focus differentiate it from high-energy or soothing workouts."
