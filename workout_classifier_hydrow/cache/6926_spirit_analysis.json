  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Climbing Intervals Row' has several elements indicating a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, such as the title 'Climb in rhythm' and the rhythmic nature of the intervals. The focus on a max rhythm of 30 reinforces this idea, providing a score of 0.75.\n\nThe classification as 'sweat' and the intensity level of 2 out of 3, combined with the upbeat pop and global hits playlist, suggest a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, though not at maximum intensity due to the mid-range intensity rating, garnering a 0.65 score.\n\nThe image showing an outdoor setting on the water indicates an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, supported by the rowing on a river which naturally leads to this classification. This visual evidence contributes to a 0.7 score for this spirit.\n\nOther spirits were considered, but the evidence strongly supports these three based on rhythmic movement, interval training, and the outdoor environment."
