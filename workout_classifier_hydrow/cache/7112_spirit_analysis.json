  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit assigned is 'Soothing & Restorative' due to the cool-down focus and the use of chill, downtempo music, which indicates a relaxed and restorative environment. The title 'Closed Eyes Cool-Down' and the emphasis on feeling body movements while rowing with eyes closed suggest an introspective and calming session. A score of 0.9 reflects this strong alignment.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is awarded a secondary classification with a score of 0.6. The description's focus on body movement coordination and the mention of rowing at a steady rhythm supports a flow-focused spirit. The music genre also aligns with rhythmic elements.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is appropriate for the environment evident in the image, showing rowing on a body of water, which is typical for adventurously experiencing nature. However, the primary focus of the workout is soothing rather than adventurous, making this a lower score of 0.5.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were not assigned due to the relaxing and informal nature of the session."
