  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Sandwich Row' is characterized by a mix of rhythm-based power and speed drills, indicating a strong alignment with 'The Meditative Grind' due to its repetitive, focus-driven format typical in rowing. The interval format and focus on power imply elements of 'The Endorphin Wave,' where there's an elevated, steady energy build. The use of indie alternative and global hits music supports this vibe by adding an uplifting, endurance-focused experience. Additionally, the emphasis on shifting rhythms gives the workout a beat-driven quality, aligning with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse.' The combination of rowing with rhythmic music ties into this vibe as well, though it's less pronounced compared to the meditative and endorphin elements. Given the workout intensity of 2 out of 3 and the playlist's energetic tracks, these vibes are assigned with moderate to high confidence."
