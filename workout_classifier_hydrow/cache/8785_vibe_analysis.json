  "vibesExplanation": "Based on the provided metadata, this workout is primarily characterized by a steady rhythm, a low-intensity level, and a focus on breathing and technique. This suggests that 'The Meditative Grind' is the most suitable vibe as it emphasizes repetitive and entrancing motion, typical of steady rowing. The workout's emphasis on proper technique and a calm approach fits the Zen-like concentration of this vibe, hence a strong score of 0.9.\n\nThe inclusion of 'rain' in the description and the music playlist with rock and global hits introduces a calming yet invigorating atmosphere, making 'The Zen Flow' another suitable vibe, though to a lesser extent, hence the score of 0.6.\n\nLastly, the combination of steady rowing and uplifting songs like 'I Want To Break Free' suggests elements of 'The Endorphin Wave,' which captures the elevating energy of the music and exercise, though less prominently, warranting a score of 0.4. Other vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded due to the low intensity and relaxed setting of the workout."
