  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which mandates including a 'Rowing machine' with very high confidence as essential equipment. The title 'Sydney Harbor Stern View' coupled with the description 'Explore near downtown Sydney along Sydney Harbor' strongly suggests a virtual rowing workout experience, where participants follow along with a rowing simulation of Sydney Harbor. No other equipment types are mentioned or implied in the metadata. Thus, the inclusion of a rowing machine is informed by both the category and context of the workout, justifying a confidence level of 1.0 for its necessity. No additional equipment is required or suggested."
