  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled 'Pauses Cool-Down' is categorized under 'row', indicating the use of rowing equipment. The description mentions 'spend 4-minutes rowing,' which strongly suggests the primary activity involves a rowing machine. Given the high emphasis on rowing in both the workout format and description, a 'Rowing machine' is identified with very high confidence (1.0) as required equipment. The image shows a rowing setting, reinforcing this classification."
