  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Steady Adventure Row' emphasizes maintaining a consistent pace with varying intervals, indicating a focus on rhythm and flow, which is reinforced by the playlist of mainstream dance and global hits music. This suits the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a score of 0.65. However, the most dominant spirit is 'Outdoor & Adventure,' with a score of 0.9, as the workout takes place outdoors on a river, which is a strong indicator of this category. The use of the word 'Adventure' in the title and the outdoor rowing activity align well with environmental exploration and the natural setting focus. The moderate intensity level of 1 out of 3 and the naming of the workout type as 'breathe' suggest a relaxed, steady pace rather than a high-energy session. This discounting of 'High-Energy & Intense' leads to the exclusion of other potential spirits such as 'Structured & Disciplined,' as the focus is less on control and more on enjoying the journey."
