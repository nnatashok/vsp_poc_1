  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Climbing Intervals Row' features three 4-minute intervals focused on climbing in rhythm and intensity, which aligns well with 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe due to its steady build and feel-good movement. The continuous climbing format and progressive rhythm suggest a moderate to high intensity, consistent with a strong endorphin release, thus providing a score of 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, the repetitive nature and focus on rhythm and climbing in rowing meet the characteristics of 'The Meditative Grind,' which involves zoning in and letting repetition take over. This justifies a score of 0.7.\n\nThe use of popular music by Ed Sheeran provides a beat-driven, enjoyable experience, contributing to 'The Groove Session' vibe, although to a lesser degree. The pop music genre typically enhances engagement and fun, warranting a score of 0.5.\n\nOther potential vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' were not selected due to the moderate intensity and more rhythmic focus of this session."
