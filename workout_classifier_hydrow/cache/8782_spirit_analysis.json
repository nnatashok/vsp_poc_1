  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Postural Mobility' aims to 'improve your mobility, flexibility, and movement,' indicating a focus on recovery and relaxation, which aligns well with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, scoring it at 0.7. The use of bodyweight exercises in the description suggests a gentle approach, further supporting this classification. Additionally, the playlist's inclusion of smooth, nostalgic 90's hits like 'Hanging By A Moment' may enhance a calming and rhythmic energy, suggesting a secondary 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a score of 0.4. The setting of the workout, being 'On The Mat,' also leans toward the soothing and restorative qualities, rather than high-intensity or outdoor adventure. The metadata lacks any explicit indicators of high-energy, structured, or outdoor qualities, which justifies their exclusion."
