  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Sunset Row' and described as a session in the lush marshes of Essex clearly aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The imagery and description suggest a natural setting, enhancing the adventure aspect. Thus, this spirit receives a perfect score of 1. \n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant due to the low intensity level (1 out of 3), the 'breathe' workout type, and the meditative aspect of rowing at sunset, scoring 0.7. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit has some presence because of the steady and rhythmic nature of rowing, as wells as the musical element from the Indie Alternative and Global Hits radio stations, so it's assigned a score of 0.5. \n\nOther spirits are excluded due to the lack of intensity, structure, or technical discipline indicated in the metadata."
