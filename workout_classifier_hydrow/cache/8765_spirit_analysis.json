  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'English Bay Stern View' strongly suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to its emphasis on exploring 'the sights of Vancouver along English Bay.' Such a description indicates an outdoor rowing experience, likely on a river or large body of water, which falls under the 'Outdoor & Adventure' category, especially given the context of rowing-based workouts. The word 'journey' emphasizes exploration and adventure, supporting this classification. The lack of specific intensity or structure-related terms suggests that other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are not applicable. Moreover, the category mentions 'journeys,' aligning with the exploratory nature indicative of 'Outdoor & Adventure.' Although there are no explicit environmental descriptions beyond the bay, the geographical setting and journey type provide high confidence in this classification. Other spirits were excluded due to the absence of relevant indications in the metadata."
