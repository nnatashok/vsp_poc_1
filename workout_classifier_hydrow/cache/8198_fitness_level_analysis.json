  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as both a 'drive' and a 'row', which typically suggests a more advanced rowing session according to Hydrow's categorization. However, the workout type 'drive' strongly aligns with an intermediate technique difficulty, as specified by Hydrow's standards, which only classify these sessions as Beginner or Intermediate. Given the context, intermediate is strongly indicated due to the structured interval training that requires moderate technical skill and rhythm control.",

These factors contribute to a 'Challenging' effort difficulty rating, as the intervals require sustained energy output, suited to those with more than basic fitness levels.",
