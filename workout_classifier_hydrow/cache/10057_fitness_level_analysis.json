Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's length of 38 minutes suggests a moderate to challenging endurance requirement, primarily due to sustained rowing activity. Since it is categorized as a standard 'journey', which usually involves a steady pace, this aligns with the 'Moderate' effort level. However, the duration and potential for sustained rowing exertion could pose a reasonable challenge, especially for less conditioned users, providing a lesser association with 'Challenging' difficulty.",
