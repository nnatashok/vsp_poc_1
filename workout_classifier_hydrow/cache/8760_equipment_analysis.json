  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Confidence Builder Row\" and falls under the \"row\" category, explicitly indicating the use of a rowing equipment. The format involves intervals at lower rhythms, a structure typically associated with rowing machine workouts. The description also emphasizes building confidence \"stroke by stroke,\" which directly refers to rowing actions. Thus, a rowing machine is required, and this is reflected in the high confidence score of 1.0. The outdoor image of a rower supports this, but indoors, a rowing machine would be used."
