  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is listed as 'drive', a category specific to Hydrow that demands higher technique mastery. This, combined with the 5,000-meter race simulation, implies it requires advanced rowing techniques like maintaining high rhythm starts (max rhythm: 34) and managing intervals for endurance and strategy. The instructor being a multiple-time medalist and the use of 'in-depth technical detail' further highlight the advanced nature of this workout.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session mimics a '5,000-meter race' and involves 'max pressure intervals,' indicating a high-effort workout. The duration is relatively short (17:39), typical of high-intensity interval training, where maintaining high rhythm and intensity throughout is physically demanding. The workout's intensity level is 3 out of 3, confirming its challenging nature, with 'sweat-packed' and 'ultimate endurance test' further suggesting it is at the high end of Challenging to low end of Extreme.",
