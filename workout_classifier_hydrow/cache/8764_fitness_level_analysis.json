  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 30 minutes, which indicates a moderate level of sustained physical activity. As a 'journey' type rowing workout, it likely involves steady-state rowing, leading to a moderate effort level due to continuous cardio activity. While the exact intensity is unspecified, rowing for this duration can be quite demanding, especially for deconditioned individuals, suggesting a moderate-to-challenging effort difficulty. The absence of specific high-intensity markers or intervals offers some alignment with these levels, yet not enough evidence to suggest 'Challenging' as a primary classification.",
