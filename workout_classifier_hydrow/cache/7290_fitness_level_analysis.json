  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which suggests either Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty according to the Hydrow platform rules. The description mentions ten sets of 1-minute high-intensity intervals requiring consistent rowing technique, which can be demanding for those unfamiliar but does not exceed 'Intermediate' due to rowing's limited complexity in mechanics. This aligns with the Drive format, which typically indicates more demanding row workouts that require proper form without being overly technical.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features a HIIT format with ten 1-minute high-intensity intervals, noted as having a 3 out of 3 intensity level. This suggests a very physically demanding session, especially in a 21-minute time frame with potential minimal rest between sets, typical of a HIIT workout. Thus, the effort difficulty is strongly Challenging and borders on Extreme Energy expenditure due to the demanding nature of maintaining maximum rhythm for high-intensity intervals, which can be daunting for users with low fitness levels.",
