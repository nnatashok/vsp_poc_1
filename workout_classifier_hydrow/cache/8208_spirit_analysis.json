  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by elements of **Soothing & Restorative** spirit due to its classification as a 'cool down' session. The focus on alternating effort strokes aligns well with recovery, relaxation, and stress reduction. The playlist, featuring calming Indie and Global Hits like Bon Iver and Taylor Swift, further supports this classification. The **Outdoor & Adventure** spirit is relevant due to the visual setting of the workout, recorded on a river, aligning with the nature-based context typical of this spirit. The interval format does introduce a structured element; however, the overall purpose as a cool down diminishes a focus on intensity or discipline, justifying the exclusion of more intense spirits."
