  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit 'Outdoor & Adventure' was chosen due to specific indicators in the title and description that suggest a journey-oriented and nature-centric experience. The workout is set on the Hillsborough River, strongly implying an outdoor rowing session, which perfectly aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The use of terms like 'Take a trip' and 'quiet afternoon' further reinforce this association, reflecting an exploration element in a natural setting. The score of 0.85 indicates a strong match, given the explicit focus on an outdoor rowing journey.\n\nThe secondary spirit 'Soothing & Restorative' is also relevant, but to a lesser extent, with a score of 0.55. The description highlights a 'quiet afternoon' which suggests a calming and relaxing ambiance. This is supported by the lack of specified music and the general tone of a leisurely journey rather than an intense workout.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the absence of indicators such as high effort, fast pace, or methodical structure in the metadata. Moreover, without specific information on music driving the session, 'Flow & Rhythm' was not applicable."
