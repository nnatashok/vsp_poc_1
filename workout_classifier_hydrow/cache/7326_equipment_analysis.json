  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, \"Afterglow Cool-Down,\" explicitly mentions rowing as a central activity, as seen in the description: \"steadily row and reflect on your hard work.\" The category includes 'row,' which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. Despite the workout type being a cool down, the emphasis on rowing justifies the inclusion of a rowing machine with very high confidence. The image also shows two individuals in a rowing setting, aligning with the metadata focus on rowing, further supporting this classification."
