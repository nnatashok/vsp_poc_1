  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Sisters Row' is an interval-based session with medium intensity and focuses on endurance over 5 to 6 minute intervals, suggesting a repetitive and steady rhythm aligning with 'The Meditative Grind' (score: 0.7). The use of indie alternative and global hits alongside popular songs like 'Heat Waves' and 'Be Kind' contributes to an elevated, feel-good atmosphere which fits 'The Endorphin Wave' (score: 0.6). The focus on rhythm and beat in rowing along with explicit lyrical content adds an element of musical intensity, characteristic of 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' (score: 0.5). The absence of extremely high intensity or aggressive music excludes vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter'. There's a moderate to high confidence in this classification due to the clear structure and music aiding in vibe definition."
