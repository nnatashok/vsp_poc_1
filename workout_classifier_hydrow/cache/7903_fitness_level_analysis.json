  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', which limits the technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The 'Climbing Intervals' format suggests some level of complexity in maintaining rhythm, which aligns well with Intermediate. The description does not mention any complex movement patterns beyond rowing, aligning with a Beginner to Intermediate range. Given the nature of rowing and the structured interval approach, the technique likely remains straightforward, but maintaining form at higher intensities during climbs could edge it towards Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features a 'sweat' type and involves three 4-minute rowing intervals with increasing rhythm and intensity. This suggests a Moderate effort level since the energy expenditure would be higher due to the intensity increases. The intensity level is 2 out of 3, indicating it can be moderately challenging, particularly for deconditioned users. The 21:32 duration also supports a moderate effort classification. The combination of intensity and duration suggests a Moderate with some Challenging aspects.",
