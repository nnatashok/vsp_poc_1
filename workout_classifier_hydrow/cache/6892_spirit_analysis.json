  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video metadata and image suggest a strong Outdoor & Adventure spirit, as the rowing session takes place on a river, with the open water and natural setting contributing to this classification. This is supported by the outdoor imagery and environment. The score of 0.9 reflects this strong alignment.\n\nMoreover, there are indications of a Structured & Disciplined spirit through the focus on specific techniques such as core engagement and hip pivoting each stroke, as well as the mention of drills called from bow. This methodical approach to improving rowing form aligns well with a structured spirit, earning it a score of 0.8.\n\nThe Flow & Rhythm spirit is also present due to the mention of maintaining rhythm with a maximum rate of 28 strokes per minute and the influence of the music playlist, which includes upbeat, rhythmic songs. The coordination in rowing and music-driven pacing support this classification, with a score of 0.7. \n\nOther spirits such as High-Energy & Intense and Soothing & Restorative were excluded as the intensity is moderate and the focus is on technique rather than recovery."
