The description emphasizes building endurance with straightforward stroke intervals. Additionally, the workout is categorized under 'standard' and 'breathe', suggesting a focus on continuous, steady-state activity rather than complex movements. The fitness level requirement of Beginner further supports the alignment with a Beginner technique difficulty, evidenced by simple execution of rowing strokes without advanced coordination demands.",
