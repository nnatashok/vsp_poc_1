  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'The Meditative Grind' due to its focus on rowing, steady pacing, and technique refinement, as indicated by the description and maximum rhythm of 24 strokes per minute. Rowing is inherently repetitive and meditative, particularly in this technique-focused cool-down session with Mike Dostal, whose extensive rowing background enhances the meditative nature of the workout. The categorization as a 'cool down' also contributes to a vibe indicative of methodical repetition and focus on form, which suits 'The Meditative Grind.' The 'Reboot Workout' vibe is also relevant due to the 'cool down' classification, which suggests a session designed to relax and refresh the body following a workout. The absence of intense or high-energy elements, alongside the playlist's smooth, globally popular music, supports a calming, post-exercise vibe. The high confidence level arises from explicit indicators like 'cool down' and 'technique,' aligning well with these vibes."
