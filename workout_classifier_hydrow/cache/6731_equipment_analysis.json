  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Core Pilates' and falls under the 'On The Mat' category, heavily indicating the use of a mat. Pilates workouts typically require a mat to perform exercises comfortably, especially for exercises strengthening the core. The image indeed shows an exercise being performed on a mat, reinforcing this inference. No other equipment is mentioned or indicated in the metadata, suggesting that the workout relies solely on the mat. Hence, the confidence score for including a mat is very high, at 0.9."
