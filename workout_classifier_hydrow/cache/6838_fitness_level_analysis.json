  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout 'Cardio Clean Up Row' falls under the 'row' category, which primarily involves straightforward rowing movements. Therefore, according to Hydrow-specific rules, the Technique Difficulty can be classified as Beginner or Intermediate. Given the workout intensity level is 1 out of 3 and described as making small adjustments to the stroke, the technique required should not exceed an intermediate level. This aligns well with its User Fitness Level Requirement, which is Beginner, making the Beginner level the most appropriate classification with high confidence.",
