  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout name and description emphasize 'Pilates' and 'circuit style,' suggesting a focus on rhythmic movement and coordinated flow, thus indicating a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.7). The playlist with upbeat pop songs supports this classification with its rhythmic, energizing nature, facilitating a mind-body connection throughout the workout. The image shows the workout is conducted outdoors, which aligns with an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.65). Conducting Pilates outdoors on a deck near water strengthens the environmental and adventurous aspect of the session. This image suggests an exploration of nature as part of the workout experience. The structure of repeated circuits doesn't entirely match a highly structured or intense discipline, nor is it focused on recovery, negating spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Soothing & Restorative.' The lack of specific sports skills also excludes 'Sport & Agility.'"
