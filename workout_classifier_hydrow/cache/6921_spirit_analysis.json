  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Soothing & Restorative' due to its focus on 'static and dynamic stretches' ideal for recovery, particularly 'after a run.' The gentle nature of stretching, combined with the lack of specified equipment and the short duration, aligns well with a restorative session. A strong score of 0.9 reflects this alignment. \n\nAdditionally, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is applicable due to the visual evidence showing participants on a beach setting, which is explicitly outdoors. This environment contributes significantly to the classification, though the main activity is on-the-mat stretching. Thus, it scores a strong 0.75. \n\nThe music genres such as Soul/Funk/Disco/Motown suggest a flowing and rhythmic backdrop, but the emphasis on stretching and recovery plays a more significant role in defining the overall spirit of the workout. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are not considered due to the nature and context of stretching."
