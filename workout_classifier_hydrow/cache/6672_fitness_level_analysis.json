  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is classified as Beginner with a score of 0.9 due to the workout being a rowing session. The metadata indicates a 'breathe' workout type, which suggests a focus on maintaining steady pacing rather than complex movements. Rowing generally involves straightforward technique, particularly in the steady format at low rhythms. There is no indication of advanced techniques being employed, further supported by the beginner-level fitness requirement.",
