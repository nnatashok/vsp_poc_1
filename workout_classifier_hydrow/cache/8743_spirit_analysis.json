  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Strike Out Row' is primarily classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the inclusion of rowing along the Charles River, which indicates a natural setting and the exploration aspect typical of this spirit. This is strongly supported by the image showing an outdoor rowing environment, earning it a high score of 0.95.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also prominent with a score of 0.85. The description's focus on increasing 'rhythm' and the presence of music genres such as 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' suggest a smooth, music-driven workout.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' is relevant as the workout is labeled under the 'Sweat' category, with a climbing format and a high rhythm (28), indicating a moderately intense session. This spirit is given a 0.7 score as the intensity level is 2 out of 3, suggesting it isn't at the maximum intensity level.\n\nThe combination of outdoor setting, rhythmic flow, and energetic music excludes other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined.'"
