  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a high score of 0.9 due to the location at Mother's Beach as the tide comes in, creating a natural outdoor setting. This meets the criteria for nature-based workouts leveraging environmental elements. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is assigned a score of 0.7, supported by the title 'Whole Body Pilates,' which suggests continuous, flowing movements that are characteristic of Pilates sessions. The presence of a playlist with smooth tracks like 'How To Save A Life' and 'Breakeven' further supports this spirit by encouraging rhythmic movement.\n\nA 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is present, albeit moderately, with a score of 0.5. The gentle nature of Pilates and the calming outdoor location contribute to a restorative experience, although it's not explicitly focused on recovery. \n\nThe absence of high-intensity indicators and specific sports training features exclude other spirits."
