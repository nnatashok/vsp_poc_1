  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. This is indicated by the terms 'high intensity intervals' and 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3,' clearly pointing to a session designed to push physical limits. The use of popular, high-energy songs like 'Panda' by Desiigner and 'Can't Feel My Face' by The Weeknd supports this classification with music aimed to energize.\n\nAdditionally, there is a significant 'Flow & Rhythm' element, as the workout emphasizes 'high rhythms' and includes songs that maintain a continuous beat, suggesting a focus on maintaining a rhythmic flow throughout the session.\n\nThe presence of rowing in an outdoor setting by a river leads to a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, evident from the image of on-water rowing, which showcases a natural environment and outdoor activity. This captures the essence of exploring nature while exercising."
