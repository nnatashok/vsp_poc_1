  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata indicates that the category type includes 'row', which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. This is further supported by the presence of rhythmic terms such as 'rhythm 22' and 'steady format', both of which are commonly associated with rowing workouts. The image also shows a person rowing, which aligns with the type of exercise. Therefore, a rowing machine is required for this workout with very high confidence (1.0). No other equipment is mentioned or implied."
