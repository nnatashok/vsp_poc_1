  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine as essential equipment. Additionally, the workout name 'Stay Present Row' and the description about cruising along the Charles River at specific rhythms further imply a rowing-focused workout, reinforcing the need for a rowing machine. This equipment is therefore classified with very high confidence (0.9). The inclusion of an outdoor rowing image supports the concept but does not replace the need for indoor rowing equipment."
