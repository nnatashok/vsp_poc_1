  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'drive' type on a rowing machine, which indicates a higher level of technique needed than basic rowing. While rowing generally is beginner to intermediate, specific 'drive' workouts require good coordination and body awareness to maintain form at a power-focused pace and rhythm cap. This aligns closely with an Intermediate technique difficulty score due to the need to exert power consistent with a rate-capped race, challenging coordination and technique execution.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'drive,' which inherently suggests a higher level of physical effort due to its power focus. With a maximum rhythm of 18 and an intensity level of 3 out of 3, the session is designed to be demanding, aiming to maximize meter accumulation over a period of 21:27 minutes. This involves significant cardiovascular and muscular effort, categorizing the effort difficulty as Challenging due to sustained intensity and the power emphasis.",
