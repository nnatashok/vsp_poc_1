  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Post-Row Mobility' is primarily classified under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a high score of 0.9. This is evident from the workout's focus on stretching and mobility post-rowing, which aligns with recovery and relaxation. The description specifically mentions 'Stretch out your body after your row,' highlighting a focus on recovery and gentle movements typical of a Soothing & Restorative spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the use of remixed songs in the playlist suggests a rhythmic element, hence the inclusion of 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.6. The music may guide the pacing of movements, facilitating a connection between the body and music, characteristic of Flow & Rhythm.\n\nThe lack of intensity or performance-based focus in the metadata excludes other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility.'"
