  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (0.8) due to its focus on maintaining a 'steady rhythm' as described in the workout description. The consistent pacing implied by a 'steady state' and the rhythmic Latin and Global Hits music further reinforce this classification, promoting a continuous, smooth movement.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' (0.9) is also applicable given the visual evidence of rowing on a river. This setting leverages natural environments, aligning with the Outdoor & Adventure spirit.\n\nThe intensity is moderate, with a rating of 1 out of 3, indicating a balanced approach rather than a high-energy one. Thus, 'High-Energy & Intense' is not applicable. Similarly, due to the lack of specific recovery focus or technical precision, 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are not relevant spirits for this workout."
