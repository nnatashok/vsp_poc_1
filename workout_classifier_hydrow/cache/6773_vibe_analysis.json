  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is classified primarily as 'The Meditative Grind' (0.7) due to its steady rhythm and climb format, suggesting a continuous, endurance-focused activity typical of rowing workouts. The emphasis on the movie trivia implies a mentally engaging yet stable experience for participants. The vibe is supported by the duration (16 minutes) and moderate intensity level (1 out of 3), making it a fitting example of repetitive, meditative exercise.\n\n'The Groove Session' (0.5) is relevant because of the 80s and global hits music playlist featuring artists like Dead Or Alive and Jackson 5, which adds a fun and engaging aspect to the workout, aligning with the vibe's focus on being fluid and expressive.\n\nAdditionally, there is an element of 'The Endorphin Wave' (0.4) given the focus on a steady climb and rhythmic movement, which can build a feeling of elevated energy and enjoyment over time.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded due to the lower intensity level and more relaxed, rhythmic nature of the workout."
