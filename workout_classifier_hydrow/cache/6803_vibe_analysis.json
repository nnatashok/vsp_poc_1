  "vibesExplanation": "The chosen vibes are primarily based on the workout's structure and the music genre. \"The Meditative Grind\" (score: 0.7) is a strong fit due to the rowing interval setup. The repetitive nature of rowing, coupled with interval training, allows participants to focus and get lost in the rhythm, which aligns well with a meditative grind experience. \"The Endorphin Wave\" (score: 0.6) is also relevant, as the steady pace and the music selection of dance and global hits suggest a feel-good, energizing atmosphere. Lastly, \"The Rhythmic Powerhouse\" (score: 0.5) can also apply due to the beat-driven music, which is integral to maintaining rhythm during rowing. These vibes are chosen over others like \"The Firestarter\" or \"The Warrior Workout\" because the intensity of the workout is moderate, not extremely high."
