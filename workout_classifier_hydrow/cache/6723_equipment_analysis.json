  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Power Pyramid Row,' which suggests that it's focused on rowing. The category includes 'row,' and the format is HIIT, which often includes rowing for intense cardio intervals. Although no specific equipment is mentioned in the metadata, the combination of the title, category, and workout type strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. The high confidence score (0.9) reflects this clear association with rowing activities. The image also shows rowing in a water setting, further supporting the need for a rowing machine for indoor equivalent exercises."
