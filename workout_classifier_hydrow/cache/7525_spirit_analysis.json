  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Stress Relief Cool-Down' and focuses on relaxation and technique, which strongly aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, scoring a high 0.9. The emphasis on sitting tall and relaxing shoulders further suggests a focus on recovery and stress reduction. The choice of 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' music supports this spirit by creating a calming atmosphere.\n\nThe image shows a scenic outdoor setting on the water, suggesting an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This setting contributes to a sense of exploration and natural relaxation, though it's secondary to the main focus on soothing relaxation, hence a score of 0.7.\n\nThe workout doesn't fit other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' due to its focus on cooling down and relaxing rather than pushing physical limits or enhancing athletic skills."
