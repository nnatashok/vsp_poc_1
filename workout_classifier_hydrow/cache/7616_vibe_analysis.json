  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized by a technique-focused rowing session, aligning well with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe (Score: 0.8). This is supported by specific metadata such as 'Technique Focused Row' and 'Focus on a different technique aspect every 10-minutes,' highlighting skill-building and technique enhancement. The use of blues/jazz and cool/downtempo music, along with the setting of Lake Tahoe, suggests a rhythmic and calming experience, which aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' (Score: 0.6). The description lacks high-intensity or competitive elements, instead emphasizing a steady rhythm ('Max rhythm: 24') and moderate intensity, aligning with a meditative and consistent workout. Finally, the serene location and low intensity (1 out of 3) also support 'The Zen Flow' vibe (Score: 0.5), which emphasizes a grounding and intentional experience, though to a lesser extent than the primary vibe chosen. The absence of competitive or high-energy elements rules out vibes like 'The Competitor' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.' Overall, the calm and technique-focused aspects drive the vibe classification."
