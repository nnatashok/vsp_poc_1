  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as \"High-Energy & Intense\" with a score of 0.7 because it features elements of fast-paced and heart-pumping activity, as indicated by the mention of 90-second intervals and the instructor's \"high energy\" and \"spicy style.\" These elements suggest a focus on intensity, pushing limits, and a dynamic approach. Additionally, the music genres (Latin, Global Hits) imply an energetic and rhythmic pace that can enhance the workout's intensity.\n\n\"Structured & Disciplined\" is also applicable, scoring 0.6, due to the \"circuit\" description, which typically involves specific sequences and progressions. The use of equipment like dumbbells suggests a level of technical precision and methodical training needed to perform strength-based exercises effectively. The inclusion of different fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) further implies a structured approach to accommodate various intensities and capabilities.\n\n\"Flow & Rhythm\" and other spirits don't fit as clearly due to the lack of specific cues related to smooth movement patterns or recovery-focused elements."
