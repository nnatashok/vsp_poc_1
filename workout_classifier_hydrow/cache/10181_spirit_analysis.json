  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.9 due to the description indicating an intense, advanced race piece with a high-intensity level (3 out of 3). Phrases like \"burst off the starting line\" and \"climbs in rhythm\" imply high effort and vigorous pacing. The presence of competitive and advanced elements solidifies this classification. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is scored 0.7, supported by terms like \"climbs in rhythm from 24 to 32\" suggesting smooth changes and a focus on pacing, characteristic of rhythmic continuity in movement. The use of Indie Alternative and Global Hits may also contribute to this rhythmic element.\n\nLastly, 'Structured & Disciplined' receives a score of 0.6 due to the structured nature of the workout, described as climbing in rhythm within a specified format (24 to 32), suggesting a methodical progression typical of disciplined routines. The advanced nature of the workout implies precision and structure in execution. \n\nOther spirits are not applicable as there's no mention or evidence of recovery focus, outdoor elements, or sport-specific skills beyond rowing."
