  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is clearly described as a 'cool down', which typically involves very light exertion designed for recovery. At a duration of just over 6 minutes and focusing on 'maintaining a steady pace', the effort level required is minimal. As a 'steady' format with a low max rhythm of 20, the workout is consistent with those designed for relaxation and recuperation, making it very suitable for deconditioned users or those at the end of a session seeking relaxation.",
