  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'March Race: Week 3 of 5' strongly aligns with 'The Competitor' vibe. The description emphasizes competition ('race to accumulate maximum meters'), suggesting a gamified, performance-driven experience, earning a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe playlist includes high-energy tracks from pop punk and global hits, which supports fast-paced, intense movement, aligning with 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe. The short duration (11 minutes) and high intensity (level 3 out of 3) also indicate a series of unpredictable challenges, leading to a score of 0.7 for this vibe.\n\nFinally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is considered due to the feel-good, elevated energy that likely comes from pushing through intense efforts in a consistent rhythm, typical of rowing races. This vibe scores 0.6 as it aligns with the overall experience but is less dominant than the other two vibes.\n\nThe non-specific music genre creates some ambiguity, but the presence of competitive elements and pop punk suggests these vibes."
