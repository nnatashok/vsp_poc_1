  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Hip-Opening Mobility' suggests a gentle and deliberate approach to movement, indicated by phrases like 'move through a variety of mobilization positions' and 'gently open up your hips.' This aligns strongly with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, which emphasizes grounding and breath-centered movement. The optional use of yoga blocks suggests a focus on supportive, mindful practice, further reinforcing this vibe with a score of 0.8 due to strong alignment. \n\nThe short duration and focus on mobility imply a restorative session, fitting the 'Reboot Workout' vibe which involves gentle stretching and body refreshment. Given the support nature of hip mobility, a score of 0.7 is assigned. The playlist featuring 'Native Riddim' and 'New Sky' indicates a calm, rhythmic environment enhancing the session's relaxing qualities. \n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' were considered but excluded as the workout's brief, restorative focus lacks the long-duration, repetitive nature typical of that category."
