  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 20 minutes long with a dumbbell circuit, balancing moderate energy expenditure with short periods of higher intensity. The description mentions fast-paced style associated with moderate intensity, but the overall duration and a focus on fitness for everybody point towards moderate difficulty. The inclusion of circuits suggests a higher energy requirement than basic exercises, warranting a slight consideration for challenging effort.",
