  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description and category 'On The Mat' strongly suggest the use of a mat. The image confirms this as you can see the instructor seated on a yoga mat. This is typical for exercises that involve sitting or lying down, and the focus on hip mobility implies floor exercises that would commonly be done on a mat. Therefore, the confidence is set to 0.9, indicating very high confidence that a mat is required for the workout."
