  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Chicago Row' is characterized by several indicators of a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as evidenced by the description 'motivating, high-intensity row' with a maximum rhythm of 32+ and an intensity level of 3 out of 3. The format is 'Interval,' which commonly aligns with high-intensity training. The playlist features energetic rock and global hits, supporting an intense and motivating atmosphere. Therefore, a score of 0.9 is assigned for this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the workout is conducted along the 'Chicago River,' fitting the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, as it involves an outdoor, nature-based rowing session. The visual of rowing along a natural waterway alongside the description strongly implies an adventurous element. This is reflected in a score of 0.85 assigned for 'Outdoor & Adventure.'\n\nOther potential spirits such as 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Flow & Rhythm' are less strongly evidenced and thus excluded due to the focus on intensity and outdoor adventure."
