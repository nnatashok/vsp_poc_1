  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', and according to the platform's specific guidelines, rowing workouts are typically rated for beginner or intermediate technique difficulty. The metadata mentions 'in-depth technical detail', suggesting some coordination but does not indicate complex movement patterns. Thus, the primary alignment is with 'Beginner' due to the straightforward nature of rowing, supplemented by 'Intermediate' due to possible technical coaching.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is inferred from the 'sweat' workout type, 21-minute duration, interval format, and instructor's high-energy style. Intensity is rated 2 out of 3, indicating significant energy expenditure without reaching extreme levels. The rowing pace ('max rhythm: 30') and the mention of high-energy workouts suggest a moderately challenging effort suitable for users slightly beyond beginner level, explaining the strong alignment with 'Moderate', and some inclusion of 'Challenging'.",
