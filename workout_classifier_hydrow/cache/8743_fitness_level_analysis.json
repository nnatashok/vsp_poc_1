  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since 'row' is a category of the workout, the Technique Difficulty is constrained by Hydrow's rules to be either Beginner or Intermediate. The description highlights a focus on proper form and climbing intensity, which suggests a small degree of complexity, linking this workout weakly to Intermediate. The rowing element primarily keeps it grounded in Beginner complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration of 16:14 minutes likely does not lead to high energy expenditure, aligning it closer to Moderate effort. However, the format as 'sweat' and a max rhythm of 28, combined with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicates the inclusion of some challenging elements, giving it some alignment with Challenging.",
