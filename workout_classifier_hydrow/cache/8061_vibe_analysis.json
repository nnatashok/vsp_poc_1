  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Technique Cool-Down' workout focuses on refining rowing technique, particularly the 'catch position', which aligns strongly with 'The Masterclass Workout'. This classification is reinforced by the 'Technique', 'Cool Down', and 'Standard, Row' tags. The score of 0.8 reflects the workout's focus on skill-building and precise technique enhancement.\\n\\nSimultaneously, the repetitive and focused nature of 'legs only drills' during a cooldown suggests elements of 'The Meditative Grind'. This vibe is characterized by a rhythmic, endurance-based approach, suitable for the 5-minute calming duration. The mellow playlist of 'Let The Drummer Kick' and 'Breezeblocks' further supports a concentrated, grind-like vibe. Thus, a score of 0.7 is assigned to 'The Meditative Grind'.\\n\\nThe absence of high energy, intense music or competitive elements excludes vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor'."
