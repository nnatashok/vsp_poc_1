  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled 'Rage Row' explicitly indicates the use of a rowing machine due to the presence of the keyword 'row' in both the title and the category ('Drive,standard,row'). The high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format with 60-second intervals suggests the inclusion of a machine to maintain consistency during the workout. Additionally, the image features a person on a rowing boat, further reinforcing the use of rowing equipment. Based on these elements, the confidence level for the rowing machine is set at 0.9."
