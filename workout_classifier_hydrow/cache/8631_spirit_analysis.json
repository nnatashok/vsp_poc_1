  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a high score of 0.9. This is supported by the fact that the rowing session is taking place along the shores of Tampa, as shown in the image, and the description indicates a natural outdoor setting. The inclusion of instructors and the environment aligns with an adventurous, nature-based experience.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' scoring 0.8. The title 'Double Pyramid Row' and the description emphasize maintaining a consistent pace and shifting in rhythm, which suggests a strong focus on coordination and music-driven pacing. The playlist with rhythmic rock songs further supports this classification.\n\n'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were considered but excluded due to the focus on rhythm and the natural setting, rather than recovery or rigid training protocols. The overall intensity level being 1 out of 3 does suggest a moderate pace, aligning more with flow than intense effort."
