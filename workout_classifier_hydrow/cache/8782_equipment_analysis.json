  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The image and metadata strongly suggest that a mat is needed for this workout. The category 'On The Mat' and 'Postural Mobility' indicate exercises performed on the ground, typically requiring a mat. The image clearly shows a mat being used, supporting this claim. The high confidence score reflects these clear indicators of mat usage, despite the absence of other equipment mentions in the metadata. No equipment besides the mat appears necessary, as the description emphasizes bodyweight exercises."
