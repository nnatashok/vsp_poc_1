  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is a 'Refine Your Stroke Cool-Down' with a focus on 'stroke refinement through pick drills.' The category 'row' strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. Although the image shows outdoor rowing, the presence of 'Category: row' necessitates the inclusion of 'Rowing machine' with very high confidence (1.0) since it's essential for practicing the drills described in the workout."
