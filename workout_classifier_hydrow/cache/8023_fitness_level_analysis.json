Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video\u2019s short duration of 8 minutes suggests a lower effort level, leaning towards Light. However, rowing can engage multiple muscle groups even in a short session, bumping the effort slightly to Moderate (score 0.4). The primary focus on scenic rowing without high-intensity cues or rhythm data aligns best with a Light effort level, so we assign a higher score of 0.6 for Light effort difficulty.",
