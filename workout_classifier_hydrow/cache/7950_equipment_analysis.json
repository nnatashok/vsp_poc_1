  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata indicates a high likelihood that a rowing machine is needed. The workout name \"Power + HIIT Row\" and the category tags \"row\" and \"Drive\" strongly imply rowing is central to the workout. Additionally, the description emphasizes sprint intervals and high-intensity intervals, which align well with the use of a rowing machine for such a high-intensity and interval-based training session. While no explicit equipment is mentioned, the category alone suggests rowing is essential, leading to a very high confidence level for requiring a rowing machine."
