  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is focused on a classic Pilates mat exercise known as 'The Hundred.' The category and description explicitly mention 'On The Mat,' indicating that a mat is necessary for comfort and support during the exercise. The image shows a person sitting on a mat outdoors, further reinforcing the need for a mat. Given the specificity of 'mat' in both the metadata and the visual evidence, the confidence level for requiring a mat is very high at 0.9."
