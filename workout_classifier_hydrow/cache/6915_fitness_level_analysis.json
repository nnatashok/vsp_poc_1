  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under rowing with 'sweat' type and 'steady' format. Given the general simplicity of rowing movements, technique difficulty will likely not exceed Intermediate. However, the pacing during 2' and 3' intervals could introduce some complexity for complete beginners. Overall, the scenario suggests a shared technique difficulty level between Beginner and Intermediate due to the steady, paced nature of the workout.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 21 minutes long, featuring 2' and 3' rowing intervals, with an intensity level of 2 out of 3. This aligns more closely with 'Moderate' effort difficulty, as it suggests a sustained, consistent energy output with moderate challenge, especially for less fit users, hence a score of 0.7 in 'Moderate'. Nevertheless, some users may find the intervals more physically demanding, justifying a weaker 'Challenging' score of 0.4.",
