  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Rock HIIT Row' suggests a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) focus, which is confirmed by the description mentioning 2' and 1' intervals and a maximum rhythm of 32. The intensity level is indicated as 3 out of 3, and the genre of music (Pop Punk, Global Hits) supports a high-energy atmosphere. Therefore, its assignment to 'High-Energy & Intense' is with very high confidence (score of 0.9).\n\nThe image associated with the workout shows rowing on a river, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This natural setting and the action captured in the photo further support this classification, though the primary metadata emphasizes intensity. Thus, a secondary score of 0.7 is given for 'Outdoor & Adventure'.\n\nThe structure and intensity of the intervals exclude spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined', which would typically involve more methodical and recovery-focused formats."
