  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is rowing-based, which according to the guidelines limits technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The description emphasizes accountability with 'proper form' as a focus, suggesting some degree of technique but likely beginner-friendly due to its categorization under 'Breathe' and 'standard'. The 'breathe' workout type and mention of 'endurance' usually requires basic technique, not complex movements. Therefore, there is strong alignment with Beginner level.",
