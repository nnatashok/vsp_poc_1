  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of approximately 11 minutes and the focus on stretching and gentle twisting indicates a low energy expenditure, aligning it with a 'Light' effort difficulty. The calm and downtempo music genre contributes to a relaxed session, suitable for deconditioned exercisers. Although yoga can involve muscular engagement, the described session does not imply any high-intensity aspects, providing strong support for the 'Light' classification with moderate alignment to 'Moderate'.",
