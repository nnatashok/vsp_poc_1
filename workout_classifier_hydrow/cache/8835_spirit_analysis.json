  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout is classified as primarily 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.9 due to its focus on cooling down and gradually reducing heart rate, which is indicated by terms like 'Low Pressure Cool-Down' and 'cool down' in the title and description. The use of 'walking pace' further emphasizes a gentle, restorative approach. The music genre, 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo', aligns with a calming and relaxing atmosphere. Additionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is relevant with a score of 0.5; the metadata emphasizes technique and rhythm ('Max rhythm: 26'), suggesting a smooth and coordinated motion typical of rhythmic exercises, but it's less central than the restorative aspect. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the lack of intensity or sports-specific focus, indicating a very confident classification in the restorative category."
