  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' in the context of a rowing workout indicates a higher technique difficulty due to complex rowing sequences typically found in Hydrow's 'Drive' category, suggesting Intermediate level. However, because the workout is row-based and takes place with supportive team energy in a format meant for varied skill levels, there is also a fit for Beginner level. The Metadata suggests the workout is supportive and fun, but the 'Drive' format implies solid proficiency in rowing mechanics.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as Challenging due to the HIIT format, max rhythm of 30 s/m, and intensity level of 3 out of 3, indicative of a high-energy, fast-paced workout. This high cardiovascular demand is consistent with workouts that would be challenging for less fit individuals. However, the duration is relatively short at 11 minutes, aligning moderately with a Moderate classification for some partes of the class.",
