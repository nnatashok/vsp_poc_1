  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'beginner-friendly' and classified under 'On The Mat', indicating low complexity in movement. Pilates generally requires some coordination, especially for effective breathwork and core engagement, which is why a score for 'Intermediate' is also included but to a lesser extent. The lack of equipment further supports a 'Beginner' classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 20:39, this Pilates class is likely to consist of lower-intensity exercises suitable for beginners. The absence of high-intensity descriptors like 'challenging' or 'extreme' suggests a low energy expenditure, fitting 'Light'. However, Pilates can engage muscles effectively, occasionally elevating overall exertion to 'Moderate'. Thus, both levels apply with higher confidence in 'Light'.",
