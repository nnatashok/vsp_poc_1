  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Endurance Climb Row' and categorized under 'row', which strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. The description, 'Shift up in rhythm each minute with Aisyah during 4-minute intervals,' suggests an interval training on a rowing machine is central to the workout's structure. Additional metadata such as 'Category: Sweat,standard,row' further supports this inference. Hence, the confidence score for 'Rowing machine' is set at 1.0, as it is explicitly required and central to the workout."
