  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Reverse Climb Cool-Down' suggests a focus on gradually reducing rhythm, aligning well with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe as it emphasizes a cooldown phase with a total-body refresh approach. The element of focusing on technique and the presence of calming music such as 'Royals' by Lorde, which is known for its mellow and relaxed tone, further supports this categorization, scoring highly at 0.85. The description of a slower, rhythm-focused activity also suggests 'The Zen Flow' vibe, which is about grounding and intentional movement, scoring 0.75. There is some indication of 'The Comfort Moves' due to the inclusion in the cool-down category, which implies safe, feel-good movement, but with a lower score of 0.4 as the primary focus is more on cooldown and technique rather than comfort. Overall, the vibes are confidently identified due to explicit indicators in the title and description."
