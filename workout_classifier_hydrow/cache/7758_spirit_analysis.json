  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout prominently features outdoor rowing on a river, aligning with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, achieving a score of 0.8 due to the natural setting depicted in the image. The use of 'Endurance Intervals' in the workout name and '2-minute climbing intervals' suggests a focus on pushing limits and effort, justifying a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit with a score of 0.6. The description mentioning a focus on climbing intervals aligns with maintaining a steady rhythm, aligning partially with 'Flow & Rhythm' scored at 0.5, particularly when considering the lively music playlist featuring rock and global hits which supports maintaining momentum. The medium intensity and structured interval format reduce the likelihood of the 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Soothing' spirits. The absence of sports-specific drills or explicit coordinated patterns diminishes the relevance of 'Sport & Agility' and 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits."
