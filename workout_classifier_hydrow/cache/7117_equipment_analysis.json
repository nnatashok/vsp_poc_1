  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Welcome to Seville Row\" and the description involves exploring Seville while performing 1-minute intervals at max pressure, clearly indicating the use of a rowing machine. The category 'row' specifically classifies it as a rowing workout, which strongly suggests that a rowing machine is central to performing this workout effectively. Additionally, the use of terms like 'drive' and 'max rhythm' further implies rowing movements, supporting a very high confidence (0.9) in the necessity of a rowing machine."
