  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.7 due to the repetitive and power-focused nature of rowing. The workout description emphasizes generating power at various rhythms, which aligns with endurance and repetition. The 'high' level of intensity further supports this vibe. 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe is also relevant with a score of 0.6 because the playlist features high-energy tracks like remixes by Alok and Imagine Dragons, suggesting a beat-driven and music-infused experience. The combination of dance and global hit remixes implies a strong rhythm that participants might find empowering and fluid. The absence of an instructor could create a more individualized and introspective experience typical of a meditative grind. The confidence level is moderate to high at 0.75 due to clear indicators of both intensity and musical influence."
