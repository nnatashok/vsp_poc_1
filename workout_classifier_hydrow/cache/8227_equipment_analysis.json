  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout name 'Endurance Pyramid Row' and category 'row' strongly indicate that a rowing machine is required. The workout description supports this by mentioning 'building endurance' and 'sustained effort,' which are typically associated with rowing exercises. The image also shows an individual using a rowing machine. Therefore, the confidence score for the rowing machine is very high at 0.9. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata."
