  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 16 minutes and the description focusing on 'gentle flow' with a breath-centered approach indicates very light physical exertion. The music described as 'Cool/Downtempo' aligns with a calm and relaxed session, further emphasizing low energy expenditure. While it is primarily light, the flow nature may introduce some elements that slightly raise the effort level to moderate, particularly for less fit individuals.",
