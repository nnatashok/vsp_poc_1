  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified predominantly under 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.8 due to the \"EMOM\" (Every Minute on the Minute) format, which indicates a regimented and precise training approach. The use of intervals with a maximum rhythm specification (max rhythm: 24) also aligns with structured training principles.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is assigned a score of 0.7 because of the circuit-style format and focus on lower body and core exercises. The inclusion of dumbbells suggests a strength and endurance component, further supported by the pop and global hits music genres, typically associated with high-energy environments.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the lack of a flow-oriented description or outdoor context. The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is not applicable given the workout's emphasis on intervals and intensity."
