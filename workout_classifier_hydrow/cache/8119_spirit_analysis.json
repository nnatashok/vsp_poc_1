  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Your Comeback Cool-Down' is prominently categorized as a cool-down session, indicating a focus on recovery and relaxation, which fits the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The use of phrases like 'cool-down perfect' and 'returning to rowing' suggests a gentle approach, suitable for recovery, earning it a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe session is conducted 'along the Charles River,' clearly situating it in an outdoor environment, directly aligning with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The scenic rowing along a river naturally incorporates aspects of exploration and nature, justifying a score of 0.8 in this category.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the calm, steady, and restorative nature of the workout, which lacks the intensity or technical precision typically associated with those spirits."
