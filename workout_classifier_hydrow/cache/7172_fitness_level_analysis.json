  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 20 minutes, indicating a short session which typically requires a light to moderate effort. Pilates tends to be low-impact, focusing on core and flexibility, which aligns with light energy expenditure. However, given the continuous circuit pattern mentioned, some cumulative fatigue may elevate it slightly to moderate difficulty. This warrants the Light score (0.6) and moderate support (0.4).",
