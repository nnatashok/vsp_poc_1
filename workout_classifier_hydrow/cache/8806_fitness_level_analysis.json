  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the category 'row', which limits Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. Given the context of maintaining a consistent power level, which implies a steady pace without complex maneuvers, the Technique Difficulty primarily aligns with Beginner. However, the presence of a specified rhythm and power focus suggests some coordination, justifying a secondary score for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 16 minutes, combined with a power focus and a medium intensity level (2 out of 3), suggests a demanding effort but not extremely high. While it is primarily moderate, the combination of 'consistent power' and the sweat category implies some intensity increase, warranting a secondary classification as Challenging for less conditioned users.",
