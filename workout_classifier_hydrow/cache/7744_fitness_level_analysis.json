  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is categorized as 'drive,' which according to Hydrow-specific rules must be classified as Advanced for Technique Difficulty. However, considering users' capabilities, the session involves intense rowing intervals with elements like 'power and speed' but lacks indication of complex movement patterns outside standard rowing. Thus, despite the initial categorization, it aligns more closely with Intermediate difficulty due to reliance on rowing basics, albeit performed at high intensity. This is weaker given the initial alignment with Advanced difficulty from the metadata.",
