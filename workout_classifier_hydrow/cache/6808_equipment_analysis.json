  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "Based on the metadata, the workout is described as 'Hip-Opening Flow' with a category of 'On The Mat,standard,on-the-mat', indicating that it is a mat-based exercise session. The use of the term 'flow', commonly associated with yoga or pilates routines, further implies the need for a mat to comfortably perform floor exercises. Additionally, the image shows a mat, reinforcing this requirement. Therefore, a mat has been identified as necessary with very high confidence."
