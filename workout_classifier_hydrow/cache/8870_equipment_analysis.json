  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Smooth + Steady Row' and the description 'steadily row along the Charles River' strongly indicate the use of a rowing machine. The category includes 'row', which necessitates including the rowing machine with very high confidence due to its central role in rowing workouts. The fact that the workout type and format also focus on rowing movements further supports this. Therefore, a rowing machine is explicitly required for this workout, justifying the high confidence score of 0.9."
