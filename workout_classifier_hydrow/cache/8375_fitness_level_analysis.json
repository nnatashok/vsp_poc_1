  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', which typically places technique difficulty at the 'Beginner' to 'Intermediate' level due to the natural rowing motion's straightforward nature. The metadata does not indicate advanced rowing techniques or highly technical skill requirements that would necessitate a higher classification. The presence of an experienced instructor providing in-depth technical detail supports a slight bump towards 'Intermediate', but the primary motion remains simple.",
