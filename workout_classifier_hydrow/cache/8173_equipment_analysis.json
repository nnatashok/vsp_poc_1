  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'On The Mat,' indicating the use of a mat for floor exercises, which is reinforced by the image showing a person using a mat. Therefore, the confidence score for a mat is 0.9. Additionally, the description explicitly mentions that a foam roller is recommended for the exercises, giving this equipment a confidence score of 0.9. This combination of evidence from both the metadata and the visual cue strongly suggests that both a mat and a foam roller are necessary for this back stretching workout."
