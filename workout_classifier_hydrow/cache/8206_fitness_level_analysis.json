  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 'cool down' nature of the workout indicates its primary function is recovery, which generally involves lower intensity and energy expenditure. At 5:48 in duration and with a focus on short strokes at a higher rhythm, it could slightly elevate the intensity, particularly for deconditioned users, making it predominantly Light with some overlap into Moderate effort.",
