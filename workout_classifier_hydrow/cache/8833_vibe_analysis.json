  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Low Rhythm Pyramid Row' seems to align well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its structured, repetitive format and lower intensity (rhythm max 22, intensity level 1 out of 3). The pyramid-style format encourages a methodical, steady approach, characteristic of 'Meditative Grind', scoring a 0.7 for noticeable elements such as rhythmic rowing and focus on consistent movement.\n\nAdditionally, the emphasis on discovering power and the high-energy, feel-good attribute of instructor Dani's classes suggest elements of 'The Endorphin Wave'. The combination of her motivational instruction and the 'Global Hits' in the playlist add an uplifting quality, supporting a score of 0.6. This vibe matches the moderate energy elevation and positive reinforcement of exercise.\n\nDespite some elements of technical instruction, the workout's primary focus on rhythm and energy didn't strongly align with 'The Masterclass Workout', as the primary goal isn't skill-building in this context."
