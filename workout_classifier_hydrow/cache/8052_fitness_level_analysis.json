  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video duration is only 5:37, which normally characterizes low-intensity sessions. Being a 'cool down' with a maximum rhythm of 20, it demands very little physical exertion focused on recovery and relaxation rather than energy expenditure. The mellow music playlist reinforces the light nature of this workout, strongly aligning it with Light effort difficulty.",
