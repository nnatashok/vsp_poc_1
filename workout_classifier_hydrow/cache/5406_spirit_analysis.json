  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the inclusion of high-intensity intervals, mentioned explicitly in the title ('HIIT Combo') and description ('Work hard during high intensity intervals'). The highest intensity level ('3 out of 3') further supports a strong classification in this category, resulting in a high score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of mat work by the waterfront, as seen in the image, contributes to an 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification. This setting outdoors adds an experiential element to the workout, justifying a score of 0.6.\n\nThe absence of specific music genre information does not greatly impact the spirit classification given the explicit workout focus described. Other spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are not prioritized due to the focus on intensity and core work."
