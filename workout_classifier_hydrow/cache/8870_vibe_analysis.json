  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Smooth + Steady Row' and involves a steady rowing session focusing on building a cardio base, which aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. This vibe captures the repetitive, immersive nature of rowing, reinforced by the description's emphasis on a steady rhythm and the experience of rowing along the Charles River. The low max rhythm (22) and moderate intensity level (1 out of 3) further support a meditative or endurance-focused experience rather than an intense one. The music genres, 'Pop low' and 'Global Hits', suggest a calm but engaging atmosphere, supporting a rhythmic grind. \n\nMoreover, the workout aims to 'build your cardio base,' which fits 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, as it signifies a steady build of energy and endurance over the session's duration of 16 minutes. However, the emphasis on a lower intensity and mindfulness places more weight on 'The Meditative Grind.' The confidence level is high (0.8) due to the explicit steady rowing focus, intensity level, and music choice, aligned with these vibes."
