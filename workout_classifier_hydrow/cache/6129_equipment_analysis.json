  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata and the image clearly indicate that this is a restorative yoga workout, categorized as 'On The Mat,' which strongly suggests the use of a yoga mat. The image confirms the presence of a mat, supporting a high confidence score of 0.9. Additionally, the photo shows a yoga block next to the mat, justifying the inclusion of blocks with a similar confidence level. These items are typical for yoga to support floor exercises and enhance poses in restorative sessions."
