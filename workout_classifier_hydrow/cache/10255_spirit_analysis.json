  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit assigned to this workout is 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.9. This is derived from multiple strong indicators in the metadata: the workout name 'Lane Cove River Stern View' and the description highlights that it takes place on a river in Sydney, emphasizing the natural environment and exploration aspect. The category labeled 'standard,row' alongside 'journeys' strongly suggests exploration and travel through waterways, further supporting this classification. A secondary spirit 'Soothing & Restorative' is considered with a moderate score of 0.5, as the description mentions 'serene surroundings at sunrise,' which implies a calming and tranquil experience. The lack of specific intensity or structured workout elements and the scenic component contribute to this spirit. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' were not assigned due to the absence of keywords indicating high intensity or strict regimens."
