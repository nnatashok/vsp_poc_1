  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled \"Holiday Traditions Row\" is characterized by a consistent jogging effort, indicating a rhythmic and meditative approach, which aligns well with \"The Meditative Grind.\" The interval format and lower intensity level suggest a focus on steady endurance over explosive power, supporting this vibe. Pop and holiday music inspire a cheerful and enjoyable workout atmosphere, aligning with \"The Groove Session.\" The playlist includes upbeat holiday hits, adding to a festive, feel-good mood. The 21-minute duration and low intensity likely provide a gradual energy build-up, matching elements of \"The Endorphin Wave.\" The lack of specific mentions of high intensity or competitive elements excludes vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Competitor.\" Overall, the chosen vibes reflect the relaxed yet engaging nature of this holiday-themed rowing session."
