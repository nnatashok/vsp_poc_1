  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily categorized under 'row', which means the technique difficulty naturally aligns with Beginner to Intermediate levels as per Hydrow's rules. The description mentions controlling power output and gradually increasing speed, which suggests some coordination is needed. However, it is less complex than movements that would require higher technique difficulty levels. Given the intermediate user fitness requirement, a moderate consideration for intermediate technique complexity is included.",
