  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and involves 'pause drills,' which are specific techniques used primarily in rowing exercises. The image features outdoor rowing, but since this is a video workout platform, it's implied to be performed on a rowing machine. Thus, a rowing machine is necessary for simulating the rowing experience in this context. Given the clear association with rowing techniques and the 'row' category, the confidence score for the rowing machine is very high at 0.95."
