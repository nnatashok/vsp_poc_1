  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' which according to Hydrow-specific rules can only be classified as either Beginner or Intermediate for technique difficulty. The description mentions a 'steady rhythm 18' and a 'jogging pace', indicating simple, consistent rowing without complex movements. This aligns more closely with a Beginner level due to the straightforward nature of the exercise.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 16:20 minutes, which is relatively short with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, indicating low to moderate energy requirement. Pacing at rhythm 18 suggests a steady, manageable effort that fits the 'Light' difficulty category. The 'jogging pace' reinforces the suitability for less fit users, but the guidance by a competitive athlete instructor tips towards low-to-moderate energy use.",
