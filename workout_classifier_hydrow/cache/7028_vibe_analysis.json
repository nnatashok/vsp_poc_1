  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Strength' focuses on strengthening the core, which aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its emphasis on repetition and structure, typical in core strength workouts. This is supported by the 'On The Mat' category, suggesting a focused, repetitive, and meditative workout style. The playlist includes energetic tracks like 'California Dreamin'' and 'God's Plan,' aligning with dance and global hits, suggesting a more groovy and rhythmic experience, giving it 'The Groove Session' vibe, albeit with a moderate score due to the lack of explicit dance elements. The outdoor setting in Long Beach may also contribute to a mindful, engaging environment. The brevity of the workout suggests an efficient yet not intensely demanding session."
