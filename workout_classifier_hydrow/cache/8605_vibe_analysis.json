  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Instructional: Perfect Your Posture' focuses on posture improvement, making 'The Foundation Builder' a strong match (score: 0.8). This vibe emphasizes strengthening fundamentals and correcting form, which aligns with the emphasis on posture. The 'Reboot Workout' vibe (score: 0.7) is also relevant, as the warm-up nature and tranquil vibe suggested by overlooking the Boston skyline provide a refreshing and low-stress experience. Given the repetitive nature of focusing on posture and the rhythmic max of 20, 'The Meditative Grind' fits moderately well (score: 0.5), suggesting a calming, focused execution. The musical choice of pop and global hits adds a lightness that supports a reboot vibe, less than intense in nature."
