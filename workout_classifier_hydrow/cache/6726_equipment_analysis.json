  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata explicitly categorizes the workout as 'Drive,standard,row', strongly implying that a rowing machine is needed. Furthermore, the category type 'row' indicates a focus on rowing exercises, making a rowing machine central to the workout. The high intensity level and the emphasis on 'climbing intervals' support this classification, as these are typically performed using a rowing machine."
