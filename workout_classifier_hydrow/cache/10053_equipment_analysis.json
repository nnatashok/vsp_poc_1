  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, titled \"Confidence Building Row,\" clearly indicates the need for a rowing machine as it is part of the 'row' category. The description highlights the expertise of the instructor, Mike Dostal, who is noted for his significant rowing background and accomplishments, suggesting a focus on rowing techniques and proficiency. The category 'row' mandates the inclusion of a rowing machine with a very high confidence level (1.0), as this type of workout cannot be performed without one. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata, reinforcing that the rowing machine is the sole necessary equipment for this HIIT 'Drive' workout."
