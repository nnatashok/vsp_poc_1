  "spiritsExplanation": "The chosen spirits for this workout are mainly driven by the gentle and restorative nature of the session, as well as the outdoor setting. The title 'Post-Row Align Yoga' and description 'align yoga designed for right after a row' emphasize relaxation and recovery, aligning with 'Soothing & Restorative.' The inclusion of chill, downtempo music further supports this classification, warranting a high score of 0.85. The image shows a scenic outdoor setting, linking it to 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.75, especially since yoga can be enhanced by natural environments. The presence of rhythmic and continuous movements typical of yoga gives 'Flow & Rhythm' a relevant score of 0.6. The structured post-row integration suggests some discipline, but not enough prominence to merit 'Structured & Disciplined.' Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are unsuitable due to the calm and restorative nature of the session."
