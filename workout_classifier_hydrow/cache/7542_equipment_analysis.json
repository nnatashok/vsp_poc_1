  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Flow + Restore' and involves yoga flows and restorative poses. The description specifies it celebrates International Day of Yoga, suggesting a focus on yoga practice. The 'Category: On The Mat' strongly implies the use of a mat, earning a high confidence of 0.9. While no equipment is explicitly mentioned in the 'Equipment:{}' field, yoga typically involves mats and sometimes yoga blocks for support, especially in restorative poses. Therefore, a moderate confidence of 0.5 is assigned for yoga blocks as optional equipment."
