  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description specifies an 'Upper body focus off Hydrow and 2-minutes on Hydrow,' indicating the use of a rowing machine for part of the session. This gives a high confidence score (0.8) for needing a 'Rowing machine.' The metadata explicitly mentions 'Dumbbells,' with the equipment list also specifying them, so their necessity has a very high confidence score (0.9). The category 'On The Mat' implies floor exercises, raising confidence that a 'Mat' is used, resulting in a high confidence score (0.7). The photo corroborates these findings, showing dumbbells and a rowing platform."
