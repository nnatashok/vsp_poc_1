  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features a 10-minute circuit session with dumbbells and an interval on Hydrow. This combination suggests moderate energy expenditure. The use of dumbbells and the 'circuit' format typically involves short rest periods and higher intensity, which can be moderately challenging but suitable for deconditioned users. Thus, this creates a balance between Moderate and Challenging levels, with a stronger alignment towards Moderate due to the manageable duration and mixed intensity.",
