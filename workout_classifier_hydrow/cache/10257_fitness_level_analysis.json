  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts 23 minutes, which moves it beyond a Light effort category. Rowing can be physically demanding over this duration, but the 'journey' type suggests it's not high-intensity, aligning more with a Moderate to Challenging effort. Significant continuous rowing effort places it at the higher end of Moderate and the lower end of Challenging for less fit individuals.",
