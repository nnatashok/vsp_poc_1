  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Post-Row Mobility with Foam Roller' is strongly associated with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, scoring 0.75. This is indicated by the focus on lengthening the spine and opening hips, which are typical goals in restorative sessions. The description emphasizes gentle movements with the foam roller to enhance flexibility and recovery.\n\nAdditionally, there is also a moderate association with 'Flow & Rhythm', scoring 0.5. The use of music such as Latin and Global Hits, and the rhythmic nature of foam rolling contribute to this spirit. However, due to the primary emphasis on recovery, the 'Soothing & Restorative' classification is more prominent. \n\nNo elements suggest high-energy, discipline, or outdoor adventure, ensuring these spirits were excluded. Despite being on the mat, the indoor setting differentiates it from 'Outdoor & Adventure.' The confidence level of 0.7 reflects clear cues in the metadata supporting the selected spirits."
