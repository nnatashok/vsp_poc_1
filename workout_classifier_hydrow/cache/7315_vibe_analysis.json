  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'cool down,' clearly positioning it as low-intensity and focused on recovery, matching 'The Reboot Workout' vibe strongly. This is supported by the metadata that highlights cooling down and self-care, earning it a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'steady format' and emphasis on prioritization could also align with 'The Meditative Grind,' indicative of a rhythmic, repetitive nature, suitable for zoning in and locking down, even though it's a brief session. Thus, it receives a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nThe use of ambient music genres like 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits' in a cool-down setting can evoke a calming and grounding atmosphere, fitting the 'Zen Flow' vibe, which focuses on breath and intentional slowness. However, this match is less strong due to the focus on cool-down rather than a full flow, so it earns a score of 0.4.\n\nThe workout clearly excludes more intense, energetic vibes, focusing instead on relaxation and recovery."
