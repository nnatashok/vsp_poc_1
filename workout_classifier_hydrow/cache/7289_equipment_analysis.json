  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for the workout \"Rhyme or Climb Row\" explicitly mentions it as a rowing workout. The use of terms like \"row\" and \"4-minute on 1-minute off rowing workout\" indicates that a rowing machine is essential to perform this workout effectively. Additionally, the category includes 'row,' further solidifying that a rowing machine is required. Since the image provided shows individuals rowing on water, it can be assumed that this is analogous to using a rowing machine indoors, and the workout's central focus is rowing. Therefore, the confidence level for the rowing machine is set at 1.0, as it is highly necessary for this workout."
