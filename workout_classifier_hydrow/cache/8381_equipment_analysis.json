  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Pure Energy Row' and the category 'row' indicate that a 'Rowing machine' is essential for this workout, giving it a very high confidence level of 1.0. The description mentions high-intensity intervals typically associated with indoor rowing sessions, and the term 'along the Charles River' metaphorically relates to rowing, though it is highlighted that it's not on water but is a rowing-inspired session. The image further supports this with rowing being the central element, so a rowing machine is undoubtedly required."
