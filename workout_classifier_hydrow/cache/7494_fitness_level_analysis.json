  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of approximately 20 minutes, combined with circuit training, implies a moderate level of sustained activity. The inclusion of high-energy music genres (Dance mid, Global Hits) and the background of the instructor as a strength and conditioning coach suggest a workout requiring moderate energy expenditure, suitable for users with some base fitness level. Thus, a Moderate rating with a score of 0.6 is appropriate.",
