  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The circuit format implies a repetitious and continuous workout with multiple exercises focusing on different muscle groups, resulting in moderate energy expenditure. The 10-minute duration suggests a reasonable workload for most users. With circuit elements, the effort can be challenging depending on intensity cues. The description of 'firing up' muscles implies a slightly higher intensity, but the short duration limits the maximum exertion. Thus, this workout aligns well with a Moderate effort difficulty with some potential for it being Challenging due to cumulative intensity.",
