Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'cool down,' which inherently involves low-intensity exercises focused on relaxation and gradual reduction of heart rate post workout. With a duration of roughly 11 minutes and a max rhythm of 28, it does not demand high energy expenditure, aligning primarily with a 'Light' effort difficulty. Given it's a cool-down, a 'Moderate' score is less likely but acknowledged if considering the rhythm involved.",
