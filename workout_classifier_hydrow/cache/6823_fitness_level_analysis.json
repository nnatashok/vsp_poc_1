  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is based in the rowing category ('drive'), which limits technical difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate according to the Hydrow-specific guidelines. The use of intervals and the description emphasizing \"sprint and max pace\" suggests a more advanced technique demand within rowing's scope, thus qualifying it for Intermediate difficulty. The potential requirement for proper technique in high-intensity phases supports this alignment.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video duration is 16 minutes with HIIT format involving 'sprint and max pace' intervals, which indicates very high energy expenditure. The max rhythm of 32 and the workout being a 'drive' (intense challenge) combined with an intensity level of 3/3, suggests an extreme effort difficulty. However, for less fit individuals, even reaching 'challenging' level prematurely is likely, supporting both levels strongly but leaning towards Extreme due to metadata cues.",
