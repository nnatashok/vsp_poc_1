  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and 'Drive', which according to Hydrow-specific rules, limits the technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate levels. The provided metadata does not specify complex movements, indicating a strong alignment with the Beginner level (score: 0.7), although the maximum rhythm of 32 suggests moderate complexity, hence a slight consideration for Intermediate (score: 0.5).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled with an intensity level of 3 out of 3, indicating high physical demand. The Drive format typically involves high energy expenditure due to its intensity demand. The short duration of 11:23 may reduce overall exhaustion, but the presence of a challenging rhythm like 32 aligns with high effort difficulty. Thus, the score for Challenging effort difficulty is 1.0.",
