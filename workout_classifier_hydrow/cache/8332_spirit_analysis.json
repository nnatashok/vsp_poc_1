  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is strongly classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the outdoor setting on the water in Vancouver, indicated by the phrase 'explore the sunny skies of Vancouver.' This aligns with the natural and exploratory elements typically seen in this spirit category. The score of 0.9 reflects the very high match based on the outdoor nature of the session. Additionally, the workout may embody 'Flow & Rhythm,' supported by the music genres of 'Rock Mid-intensity' and 'Global Hits,' and the smooth flow of rowing on water. These elements suggest coordination and a musical pace, earning a score of 0.6. The mention of 'Max rhythm: 28, Format: Pyramid' reinforces a rhythmic approach. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are less applicable due to the moderate intensity level and the less formal, more exploratory workout format."
