  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row,' which directly implies the use of a rowing machine, especially given the title 'Androscoggin River Stern View,' suggesting a rowing perspective or experience. The category includes 'Journeys' and 'standard,' which likely indicates a virtual rowing session typically conducted on a rowing machine to simulate the journey on the river. The mandate for a high confidence score for 'row' category workouts means the rowing machine is central to this workout. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata, reinforcing the focus on the rowing machine for this session."
