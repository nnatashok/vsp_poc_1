  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Technique Cool-Down' emphasizes a focus on technique while cooling down, clearly situating it as a recovery-oriented session. The steady format and low max rhythm (22) support a calming and restorative vibe. This aligns well with 'The Reboot Workout' due to its focus on body refreshment and low stress, meriting a score of 0.8.\n\nThe presence of Bruce Springsteen's softer, live rock music, although typically more energetic, is here likely more subdued, complementing a gentle cool-down flow, lending itself slightly to 'The Zen Flow' vibe with a score of 0.6.\n\nGiven the workout's emphasis on technique, 'The Masterclass Workout' is relevant with a focus on skill building and mindful improvement, though secondary to the relaxation aspect, meriting a score of 0.5.\n\nOverall, the metadata strongly indicates a cooldown session designed for recuperation and technique refinement rather than intense activity."
