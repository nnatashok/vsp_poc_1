  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's metadata strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine as essential equipment. The title, 'Endurance Climb Row,' along with the category 'row,' explicitly suggest a rowing focus. The description mentions '4-minute intervals that climb in rhythm,' which aligns with rowing machine exercises, especially in a 'climb' format. Furthermore, the category type 'row' mandates inclusion of a rowing machine with high confidence. Therefore, a Rowing Machine is identified as necessary with very high confidence."
