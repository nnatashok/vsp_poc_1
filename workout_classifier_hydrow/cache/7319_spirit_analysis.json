  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout displays a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the rowing setting on a river as depicted in the image. This natural environment enhances the feeling of exploration and connection with nature, fitting the spirit's criteria. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also prominent, supported by the music's classic soul and Motown groove, which assists in establishing a continuous and coordinated movement pattern. The description emphasizes building cardio at a low intensity with a max rhythm of 26 strokes per minute, aligning with the smooth and rhythmic theme. While the intensity level is low, which might suggest a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, the focus on rhythm and flow is more indicative of a low-intensity aerobic session rather than a purely relaxing one. These two spirits best capture the energetic qualities of the workout."
