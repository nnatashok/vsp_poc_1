Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 30-minute duration combined with dumbbell exercises and 3-minute rowing intervals indicates a workout that is moderate to challenging for deconditioned users. The interval format suggests periods of increased effort, contributing to a Moderate (0.6) and Challenging (0.4) effort difficulty classification. This is inferred from the workout's structure and focus on upper body circuits.",
