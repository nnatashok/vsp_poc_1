  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as 'beginner friendly pilates,' indicating that the movements are designed to be accessible to those with minimal experience. Pilates typically involves controlled, low-impact exercises that focus on stability and alignment, consistent with Beginner-level technique complexity. The use of the term 'beginner' in the description further supports this classification. However, pilates can require some body awareness and coordination, which is why there is a partial alignment with Intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short at just over 10 minutes, which typically suggests a lower energy expenditure. Pilates is generally low-impact and involves controlled movements, aligning with Light effort difficulty. The mention of 'beginner friendly' and the focus on stability, rather than high-intensity intervals or complex movements, further supports a classification of Light effort difficulty.",
