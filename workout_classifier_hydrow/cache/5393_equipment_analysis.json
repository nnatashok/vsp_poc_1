  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Yoga for Cyclists,' categorizing under 'On The Mat', which suggests that a mat is essential for performing yoga exercises comfortably and safely. This is confirmed by the image showing the use of mats. Additionally, the metadata mentions 'flow,' aligning with yoga practices that typically require a mat. The image also shows yoga blocks beside the participants, which supports the inclusion of blocks as a needed equipment. Yoga blocks are commonly used in yoga sessions to assist with flexibility and alignment, providing a confidence score of 0.8. Thus, the mat is very likely required, with blocks also being necessary due to their presence in the image."
