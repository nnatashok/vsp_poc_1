  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.8. The title 'Technique Warm-Up' and description emphasizing foundational technique and specific stroke types ('legs only, legs and core, and full strokes') suggest a focus on precise training and form improvement. Titles such as 'Format: Technique' and 'Workout Type: warm-up' further imply a methodical approach.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant with a score of 0.7 because the image shows rowing on a river, aligning with outdoor-based activity. Although the music genre includes 'Pop mid' and 'Global Hits', it contributes minimally to the overall classification, but updates the workout atmosphere.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are less applicable given the description and focus, which do not suggest intense energy or recovery orientation."
