  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Rage Row' with a description focusing on 'let go of frustration' and 'high-intensity session' points strongly towards 'The Warrior Workout' vibe. The use of HIIT, 60-second intervals, and the maximum rhythm of 32+ contributes to a sweat-dripping, primal energy experience, justifying a high score of 0.9 for 'The Warrior Workout.' The adrenaline-pumping aspect, evidenced by the high intensity level rated 3 out of 3 and the energetic music playlist, aligns it with 'The Adrenaline Rush,' scoring 0.7. The music genres, Hip Hop/R&B and Global Hits, along with songs by Flo Rida and Lil Nas X, imply a rhythm-driven environment, which allows for a 0.6 score under 'The Nightclub Workout.' The vibes are clearly defined with high confidence due to explicit metadata indicators."
