  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout predominantly displays a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit due to its interval format and focus on maintaining a 'consistent split,' suggesting methodical pacing and technical precision (score: 0.8). The use of rock music tracks like 'Bad Medicine' and 'I Wanna Rock' adds rhythmic elements, creating a flow that matches the rowing rhythm, further supported by tags like 'breathe' (score: 0.6). Additionally, the image shows outdoor rowing on a river, aligning with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit as it involves environmental interaction, enhancing the outdoor exploration aspect (score: 0.7). The intensity level is moderate, shaping the disciplined and rhythmic nature while supporting the outdoor spirit due to the setting. 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits were excluded due to the moderate intensity and instructional focus on consistency and control."
