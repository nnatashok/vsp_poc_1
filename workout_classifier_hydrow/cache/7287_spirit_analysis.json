  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a strong score of 0.9. This is based on the focus on improving movement and balance, holding corrective positions, and releasing tension as described in the metadata. These elements emphasize recovery and relaxation, which are key aspects of this spirit. The absence of equipment suggests a gentle, accessible session.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also applicable with a score of 0.5, as the mention of 'holding' and 'slowly release tension' suggests a smooth, continuous movement pattern that aligns partially with the flow aspect.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to a lack of high-intensity or outdoor adventure elements. The setting, though outdoors, is not nature-focused enough to be classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure.' The music genres do not strongly influence the workout's classification in this context."
