  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Legs + Core Cool-Down' primarily aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to its focus on a cool-down format, emphasizing technique and control (\"emphasize your technique\"), clearly aimed at relaxation and recovery. The music choices, such as \"Drivers License\" and \"Glimpse Of Us,\" with their calm and emotional tones, further reinforce a soothing atmosphere, justifying a strong score of 0.85.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant, as the workout emphasizes rowing with a steady \"max rhythm\" of 22, promoting a rhythmic, coordinated movement pattern. The playlist's pop and global hits might enhance this music-driven flow, supporting a moderate score of 0.65.\n\nFinally, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is applicable due to the image of the workout conducted on a river, suggesting a nature-based setting, though it's less directly mentioned in the metadata. This supports a milder score of 0.55. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded as there's no indication of high intensity or sports-specific skills."
