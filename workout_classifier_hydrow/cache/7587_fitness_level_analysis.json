  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'Drive', which inherently suggests advanced techniques due to its high-intensity nature, but given the context of rowing exercises, the Technique Difficulty is classified as Intermediate. This decision is based on the Hydrow-specific rule stating that rowing (even of the 'Drive' format) should not exceed Intermediate, aligning with simple rowing mechanics requiring moderate coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as a 'Drive' session, noted for its intensity ('high-intensity workout') and assigned a level 3 out of 3 intensity. The 21-minute duration with a max rhythm of 30 in HIIT style indicates significant energy expenditure with minimal rest, further affirming the Extreme effort classification. These elements suggest a very demanding workout for users with low fitness levels.",
