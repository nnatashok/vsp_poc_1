  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Alternating Rhythms Row,' which explicitly suggests rowing as a primary activity. The category includes 'row,' making it crucial to identify the rowing machine as required equipment with very high confidence. The image provided shows individuals rowing on the water, further reinforcing this need. While the workout description does not explicitly mention the equipment, the focus on rhythm and the use of 'row' strongly align with the usage of a rowing machine."
