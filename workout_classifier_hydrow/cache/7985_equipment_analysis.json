  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout named \"Speed Builder Row\" and categorized under 'row' strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. The category 'row' implies rowing-based exercises, which typically require a rowing machine, especially for indoor workouts. The description mentioning high-intensity intervals further supports this, as rowing machines are often used for such interval training due to their ability to provide variable resistance suitable for both intensity and speed training. Hence, the confidence level for a rowing machine being needed is very high, at 1.0."
