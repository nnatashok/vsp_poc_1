  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 10:58 minutes, which is quite short and typically demands low energy expenditure, aligning with a Light effort classification (0.8). The 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' music supports a relaxed atmosphere typical of light exercise. However, if the post-row session involves active stretching and mobility work, this may slightly increase the demand to a Moderate level (0.4), but not significantly due to the short duration and yoga nature.",
