  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Effort Focused Row,' emphasizes maintaining a steady rhythm during intervals, which aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, indicated by the description of controlling effort and the relatively low intensity level (score 0.75). The mention of intervals and slightly increasing rhythms suggests 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, with elements of sustained energy and feel-good movement, supported by the use of dance and global hits music which builds steady energy (score 0.65). Finally, the music playlist, featuring upbeat, rhythm-centric tracks like 'Stole The Show' and 'Levels,' contributes to 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, providing a beat-driven rowing session with a moderate score of 0.55. The combination of controlled effort, music-driven energy, and rowing aligns these three vibes well with the metadata description."
