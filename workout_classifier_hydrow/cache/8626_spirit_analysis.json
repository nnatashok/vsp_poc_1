  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.9 as it is conducted on a river, leveraging the natural outdoor setting. This aligns perfectly with the spirit definition. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also a strong fit, scoring 0.75, due to the interval format ('1', 2', 3', and 4' intervals') which suggests methodical and progressive training focused on rhythm (set at 26). The workout's emphasis on consistency supports this classification.\n\nAdditionally, \u2018Flow & Rhythm\u2019 scores 0.6, as the steady rhythm of 26 strokes per minute implies a continuous, music-driven pacing echoing this spirit. The playlist featuring upbeat and well-known tracks (\"In The Summertime,\" \"Life Is A Highway\") further supports a sense of smooth and rhythmic execution. Given the categorization under 'Sweat,standard,row' and 'Intensity level: 2 out of 3,' there's also a mild high-energy component but the primary focus remains on rhythm and structure."
