  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Lengthen Your Legs Row' is primarily classified as 'The Meditative Grind' due to its focus on repetitive rowing along the scenic Charles River, encouraging a zone-in experience, with an extended duration of 31 minutes. The term 'strive to find power in your legs' suggests a sustained, determined effort typical of endurance rowing, supporting a score of 0.8.\n\n'The Endorphin Wave' is also a relevant vibe as the workout is under the 'sweat' category and set to energetic pop hits like 'Chelsea Dagger' and 'Blinding Lights', indicating a feel-good, elevated energy experience with a steady build, leading to a score of 0.7.\n\nFinally, elements of 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' are present, given the beat-driven, music-infused session with songs like 'U + Ur Hand' and 'Stronger', adding a dynamic element to the rowing format, justifying a score of 0.6. Despite not being the primary focus, the upbeat music contributes to a strong but fluid rowing session."
