  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout is a 'row' type under the category 'Breathe,' the technique difficulty is inherently limited to Beginner or Intermediate. The low intensity level, steady pace, and focus on breathing imply very basic rowing movements suitable for those new to the exercise. However, the presence of a seasoned instructor like Mike might introduce slightly more refined techniques typical for those who may have some rowing experience, aligning with an Intermediate level but not significantly complicating the workout.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's max rhythm is set at 24 with a duration of just over 16 minutes, and it falls under the 'Breathe' category, emphasizing a relaxed, lower-intensity effort. The description provides no indication of high-intensity components or demanding segments, and the 'intensity level' tagged as 1 out of 3 aligns with a Light effort level. However, rowing itself can provide moderate cardiovascular benefits, thus a minimal Moderate score is assigned owing to the endurance component involved.",
