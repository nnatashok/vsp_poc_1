  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Cardio Intervals Row' combines rhythmic rowing with an energetic twist. The mention of 'build in rhythm during two 4-minute intervals' indicates a focus on smooth, continuous motion, supporting a 'Flow & Rhythm' classification with a score of 0.7. The description of the workout as 'sweat' along with an 'intensity level 2 out of 3' and inclusion of tracks from Dance and Global Hits playlists suggest an energetic vibe, earning it a 'High-Energy & Intense' score of 0.6. Additionally, the photo reveals the session takes place on a river, fitting the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit perfectly with a score of 0.8 since rowing in natural settings incorporates elements of exploration and nature engagement. The structured interval format also hints at some discipline but doesn't heavily dominate the workout's spirit, thus it wasn't emphasized in the final evaluation."
