  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is clearly high-intensity, as indicated by the title 'HIIT Pyramid Row' and the description mentioning 'high-intensity intervals.' The specified workout intensity level of 3 out of 3 reinforces this classification, making 'High-Energy & Intense' a strong match (score: 0.9). \n\nAdditionally, the phrase 'Dodge icebergs in the waters of Whittier' suggests an outdoor setting, and the image confirms that the workout takes place on a river. This aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, as it involves navigating natural environments (score: 0.85). \n\nThe playlist of upbeat and energetic songs like 'I Want You Back,' 'I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles),' and 'My House' also supports the high-energy atmosphere. There are no strong indicators for other spirits, such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative.' The spirit assignment is made with high confidence due to strong evidence from the metadata and visual context."
