  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout is classified under \"High-Energy & Intense\" with a high score of 0.9 due to its focus on endurance and intensity, as indicated by the \"Drive\" type and the maximum intensity level of 3. The gradual lowering of splits and references to rhythm, such as \"Max rhythm: 30,\" emphasize intensity and pacing.\n\nThe \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit is also appropriate with a score of 0.8. This session is part of a series (\"Drop Your Split\"), following a progressive format aimed at simulating a 20-minute test, which involves precise pacing and technical execution.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit receives a score of 0.7, supported by the image showing the session is conducted on a river, aligning with nature and exploration aspects.\n\nOther spirits such as \"Flow & Rhythm\" or \"Soothing & Restorative\" are less relevant here, given the description's emphasis on endurance and performance, as well as the lack of explicit indicators for relaxation or recovery."
