  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'All in One Row' is primarily rhythmic and endurance-focused, indicated by the format description of 'Intervals' and the duration being over 30 minutes. This aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, emphasizing zoning in and repetitive motion, typical in rowing activities. The playlist includes songs that are upbeat and energizing from the 90's and global hits, which match the vibe 'The Endorphin Wave.' The description mentions spending 20 minutes at a 'Sweat intensity,' which points to elevated energy over an extended period, reinforcing this vibe. The inconsistency in explicit lyrics and unspecified music genres creates minor ambiguity, but overall, these vibes fit strongly with the workout's structure and intended experience."
