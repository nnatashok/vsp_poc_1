  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Breathe through Emotions Row' suggests a focus on mindfulness and emotional reflection, which aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The use of pyramid intervals and a relatively low intensity of 1 out of 3, combined with the 'breathe' category, supports a repetitive and rhythmic element typical of this vibe, warranting a score of 0.7. 'The Zen Flow' is also relevant, due to the emphasis on breathing and emotional reflection, indicating a grounding and intentional session, matching with the relaxed music genre played, such as 'You Can't Hurry Love' and 'My Girl'. Thus, it receives a score of 0.6. The choice of light pop tracks reinforces a calming atmosphere, justifying these selections. Other vibes were excluded as the workout lacks intensity or dynamics characteristic of more aggressive or high-energy vibes."
