  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit at a score of 0.9. The HIIT format, with 1-minute intervals and a maximum rhythm of 32, aligns strongly with high intensity. This is further reinforced by its intensity level of 3 out of 3. The music playlist, including dance and global hits, supports a vigorous environment typical for high-energy workouts.\n\nThe setting in Brunswick, Maine suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, scoring 0.85. The visual confirms the rowing takes place outdoors, leveraging the natural river environment.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is present but to a lesser extent, with a score of 0.6. The continuous rowing movements and music-driven pacing suggest an element of rhythmic flow, although intensity takes precedence.\n\nOther spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were not emphasized due to the workout's intense and dynamic nature."
