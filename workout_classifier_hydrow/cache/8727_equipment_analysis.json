  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled 'Balance + Core Align' suggests floor-based exercises with an emphasis on balance and alignment. The category 'On The Mat' and the mention of practicing various poses strongly imply the need for a mat, which is typical for such activities to provide comfort and stability. The description explicitly states 'have fun on the mat,' and the image confirms the use of a mat, supporting a very high confidence score for the mat's necessity in this workout. No other equipment is indicated by the metadata or visible in the image."
