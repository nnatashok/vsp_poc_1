  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 20 minutes, and it's set as a 'Journey' type on still waters, which typically implies a steady, moderate pace suitable for enjoyment rather than high-intensity exercise. The metadata lacks specific intensity markers or intervals, suggesting a lighter physical demand. This leads to strong alignment with 'Light' and moderate alignment with 'Moderate' effort difficulty.",
