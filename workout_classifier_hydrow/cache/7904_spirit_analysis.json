  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Step by Step Row' prominently features elements of both 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure'. It takes place on Lake Tahoe, clearly setting a natural, outdoor scene, which is a hallmark of the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, scoring a high 0.9 in alignment with such sessions. The description mentions 'elevate your rhythm and intensity', suggesting an emphasis on the rhythmic flow typical of the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, particularly with a rowing format that follows a rhythmic and coordinated approach. Additionally, the Indie Alternative music tracks align with these themes, as these types of songs often support rhythmic and continuous movement. The workout intensity is labeled as 1 out of 3, indicating a moderate pace, which further supports the flow instead of a high-energy push. The choice of location and activity makes 'Outdoor & Adventure' the primary spirit, followed closely by 'Flow & Rhythm'. Other spirits were not as applicable due to the lack of emphasis on high intensity, technical discipline, or recovery."
