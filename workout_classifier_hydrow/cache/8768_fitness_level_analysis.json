  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 20:14 minute rowing session, categorized as a 'journey', which suggests a focus on enjoying the surroundings ('English Bay') rather than high-intensity intervals or complex sequences. The lack of additional intensity cues and the standard format suggests energy expenditure is likely low to moderate. Duration is relatively short, fitting light to moderate effort levels for low fitness users.",
