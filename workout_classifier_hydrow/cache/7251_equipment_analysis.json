  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Bodyweight Strength,' indicating it is a bodyweight routine, implying no need for traditional gym equipment. However, the category 'On The Mat' strongly suggests that a mat is needed to perform the exercises comfortably and safely, especially since it involves moving through rounds of exercises. The image confirms the use of mats by both individuals in an outdoor setting, further supporting the need for a mat. The confidence score for the mat is very high at 0.9 due to its explicit mention in the category and visual confirmation. No other equipment is required for this workout, suggesting it is primarily bodyweight-based on a mat."
