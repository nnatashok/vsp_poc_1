  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Chasing Speed Row' is primarily classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the explicit mention of a HIIT format, the highest intensity level (3 out of 3), and the focus on achieving 'low splits,' which implies vigorous effort and physical exertion. The description encourages participants to channel powerful emotions like anger and passion, reinforcing the intense energy focus, thus justifying a score of 0.9.\n\n'Sport & Agility' is also a relevant classification. The description highlights Sera Moon\u2019s background as an Olympic-aspiring athletic rower and emphasizes competitiveness and overcoming challenges, which are indicative of a sport and performance-based nature. The workout targets advanced users and incorporates elements of speed and reflex training, which align with this spirit, resulting in a score of 0.7.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'Flow & Rhythm,' are excluded due to the lack of emphasis on continuous movement or music-driven pacing, and 'Outdoor & Adventure' is not applicable due to the absence of nature-based aspects."
