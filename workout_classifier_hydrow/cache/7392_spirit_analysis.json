  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the emphasis on continuous movement and coordination in the 'twists flow.' The use of yoga blocks suggests a focus on fluidity and alignment. The description highlights opening up the body, which aligns with the flowing nature of the workout. The music playlist, consisting of chill mid and downtempo tracks, further supports a rhythmic and smooth experience, earning this spirit a score of 0.8.\n\nThe workout is also classified under 'Outdoor & Adventure' based on the setting in Florence and the visual of an outdoor location. This natural environment, coupled with the \"on-the-mat\" categorization, suggests an exploration of space and connection with the surrounding nature, justifying a score of 0.7 for this spirit. The presence in a scenic, outdoor space aligns well with the adventure aspect, amplifying the soothing, explorative elements of the workout.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Structured & Disciplined' were not chosen due to the lack of emphasis on technical precision or methodical training protocols."
