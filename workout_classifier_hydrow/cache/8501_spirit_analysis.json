  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the setting on the Vltava River in Prague, as indicated by the name 'Vltava River Bow View' and the description of 'Escape to the pristine waters of Prague on a sunny day.' This suggests a natural, scenic environment, which aligns perfectly with the Outdoor & Adventure spirit, earning a score of 1.0 for its embodiment of nature-based exploration. The secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' scoring 0.5 due to the potential for smooth, consistent rowing typical of river journeys, even though there's no specific mention of rhythm-focused elements. Other spirits are not applicable as there's no mention of intense effort, structured protocols, sports specificity, or restorative focus."
