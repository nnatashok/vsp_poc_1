  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. The description emphasizes the experience of 'taking in the historic sites of downtown Prague along the Vltava River', which suggests that this is a rowing journey, simulating a rowing experience on the river. The high-confidence rating (0.95) is assigned because the category explicitly includes 'row', indicating a very high likelihood that a rowing machine is central to this workout experience. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata."
