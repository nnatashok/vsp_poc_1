Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is only 5 minutes and 56 seconds, focusing on cool-down, which inherently suggests a low intensity. The purpose of a cool-down is to gradually reduce heart rate and allow the body to begin recovery. There are no signals of high intensity or challenging movements, verified by keywords such as 'cool-down' and 'focus on proper technique', leading to a Light effort difficulty classification.",
