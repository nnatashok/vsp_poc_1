Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 30 minutes with intervals of 30\u201d and 45\u201d suggests moderate energy expenditure, likely challenging for deconditioned users. The 'Moderate' effort difficulty is supported by the interval-based structure, requiring sustained engagement without weights. The interval nature introduces a potential Challenging rank, but given the non-complex bodyweight focus, it predominantly aligns with a moderate intensity.",
