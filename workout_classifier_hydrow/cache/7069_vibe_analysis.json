  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized by interval rowing, suggesting a repetitive, endurance-focused experience, which aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe (score: 0.7). The integration of global hits and pop music, along with explicit lyrics, introduces a lively, euphoric element, fitting aspects of 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe (score: 0.5), though it's less dominant due to the structure of the workout. The use of intervals and a mid-level intensity also supports 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe (score: 0.6) as it provides a gradual energy build through steady movement. The 11-minute duration and interval format reinforce a dynamic yet manageable energy build, further justifying these vibe selections. Other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Groove Session' were excluded due to the moderate intensity and lack of intensive, high-paced components."
