  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily instructional and technique-focused, as indicated by the title 'Instructional: 3 Points of Contact' and the description emphasizing a strong foundation. This aligns with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe, which is technique-driven and skill-building, scoring a 0.7 due to its emphasis on foundational rowing techniques.\n\nThe category 'Warm-up' and focus on basic contact points suggest an element of 'The Foundation Builder' vibe, which is about strengthening weak points and perfecting basics, earning a 0.6 score as it fits well but not as prominently as the instructional aspect.\n\nA secondary match could be 'The Reboot Workout', warranting a 0.4 score, due to the short duration and warm-up nature, contributing to a gentle approach to preparing for more intense exercise.\n\nThe music choice ('Pop mid, Global Hits') could slightly enhance the enjoyable aspect, but the primary focus remains on technique and foundation-building. Therefore, other vibes like 'The Nightclub Workout' or 'The Groove Session' are not applicable."
