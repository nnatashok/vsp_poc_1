  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Bootcamp HIIT Row\" and described as \"Hit short intervals at high intensities\" clearly indicates a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format. The mention of \"high intensities\" and a workout intensity level of 3 out of 3 supports a classification under \"High-Energy & Intense\" with a perfect score of 1.0. \n\nThe image shows rowing on a river, aligning with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. This setting, combined with the outdoor environment, complements the adventurous aspect, justifying a score of 0.7.\n\nThe playlist featuring energetic songs like \"Heartlines\" and \"Monster\" supports the intense and rhythm-driven nature of the session. No elements suggest a focus on rhythm without intensity, soothing qualities, or structured protocols, so other spirits were excluded."
