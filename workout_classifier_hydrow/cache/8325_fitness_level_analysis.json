  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is labeled as 'drive', which, according to Hydrow-specific rules, automatically aligns with an Advanced Technique Difficulty due to its emphasis on powerful rowing strokes and coordination. However, since the workout is a rowing-based exercise, the Technique Difficulty cannot exceed Intermediate, which regularly applies to rowing workouts. Thus, this mismatch from typical classifications suggests a well-structured rowing session that demands a fair amount of technique and skill.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's 'drive' nature suggests a highly intense session, further confirmed by a max rhythm of 30 and an intensity level of 3 out of 3. The time duration of 21:25 in an interval format indicates significant effort expenditure. Consequently, while this aligns strongly with the 'Challenging' level, the specifics, like maximum rhythm, also suggest traits of 'Extreme.'",
