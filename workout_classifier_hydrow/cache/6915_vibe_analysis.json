  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Club 26 Row' combines elements that suggest a meditative and steady approach. The title indicates a focus on maintaining a rhythm ('Find a rhythm 26 and lock it in'), which is characteristic of 'The Meditative Grind.' This vibe is further supported by the workout type labeled 'steady' and the description that emphasizes pacing during intervals. The duration of 21 minutes aligns with a focused and repetitive activity, indicating a moderate intensity suitable for zoning in during the row.\n\nThe inclusion of 'Sweat' as a category and a moderate intensity level ('2 out of 3') suggests an element of sustained effort and energy, aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave.' The radio stations played, such as Indie Alternative and Global Hits, can contribute to an uplifting and energetic atmosphere without overwhelming intensity.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded due to the moderate intensity and lack of high-intensity interval elements in the metadata."
