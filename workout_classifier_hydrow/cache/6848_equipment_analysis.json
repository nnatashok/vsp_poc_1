  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is labeled as a 'flow,' which typically suggests yoga or movement-based exercises performed on a mat. The category 'On The Mat' strongly implies that a mat is required for comfort and support during the exercises. The image reinforces this, showing an individual practicing on a mat outdoors. These pieces of evidence suggest a very high confidence that a mat is needed for this workout, leading to a confidence score of 0.9."
