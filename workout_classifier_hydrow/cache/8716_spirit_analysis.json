  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Finding Center Row\" indicates a focus on centering and relaxation, supported by the interval format with a gentle intensity level of 1 out of 3. This suggests a calming, restorative nature, earning the 'Soothing & Restorative' classification with a score of 0.7. The presence of intervals without high speed highlights a methodical but relaxed approach. The outdoor image on a river strongly aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, scoring 0.75, leveraging the natural setting for an exploration vibe. The alternating rhythms between 22 and 24, combined with a music-driven approach (pop and global hits), contribute to a 'Flow & Rhythm' classification with a score of 0.6, as there's a focus on maintaining continuous coordination with the music but not necessarily at a high intensity. No significant indicators align with 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Structured & Disciplined,' or 'Sport & Agility,' leading to their exclusion."
