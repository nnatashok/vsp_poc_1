  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which traditionally places it in either the Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty level. This is reinforced by the presence of climbing intervals in rhythm, which requires some coordination but is limited compared to more complex movement patterns. Since the fitness level requirement is Intermediate, the technique difficulty aligns with this level, further validated by the 2 out of 3 intensity rating which suggests a need for somewhat developed rowing skills but not advanced techniques.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a clear interval structure, indicated by 'Climbing Intervals', which suggests elevated energy expenditure due to periodic high intensity. The duration of 11:27 minutes with two 4-minute high-rhythm intervals peaking at a maximum rhythm of 28 suggests this workout is moderately to challenging in terms of effort for less conditioned users. The intensity level is marked as 2 out of 3, indicative of a medium demand, bridging the Moderate to Challenging effort levels.",
