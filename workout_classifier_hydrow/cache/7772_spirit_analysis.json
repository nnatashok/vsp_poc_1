  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Peppy HIIT Row\" is clearly aligned with the \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit, scoring 0.9 in this category. This is evidenced by the use of the term \"HIIT\" (High-Intensity Interval Training) in the title, the specified 'drive' format, a maximum rhythm of 32, and an intensity level of 3 out of 3. These elements collectively indicate a fast-paced and vigorous session. Additionally, phrases like \"Bring some energy\" and the incorporation of 90s upbeat pop-punk and global hits further emphasize a high-energy environment.\n\nThe workout also possesses elements of the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit, scoring 0.8. This is supported by the description mentioning rowing \"along the shores of Hanover,\" which indicates an outdoor setting. The inclusion of this natural location aligns with the exploration and environmental challenges typical of the Outdoor & Adventure spirit.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to a lack of relevant indicators in the metadata, such as flow, soothing aspects, or structured discipline beyond HIIT formatting."
