  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Bootcamp HIIT Row,' explicitly mentions 'row,' indicating it's centered around rowing. The category includes 'row,' and the high-intensity interval training format further suggests the use of a rowing machine for short bursts of activity. Additionally, the image shows people in a rowing scull, but for an indoor workout context, the equivalent would be a rowing machine. This supports the classification with very high confidence."
