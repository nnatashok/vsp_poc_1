  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Memorial Day Row,' explicitly mentions 'row' in the name and is part of the 'row' category. This strongly indicates that a rowing machine is required for the workout. The description refers to a 'steady row along the Charles River,' further reinforcing the necessity of a rowing machine. Given these factors, the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high at 1.0. The workout's focus on rowing as a primary activity necessitates this specific equipment, aligning with the classification schema's requirement when the category includes 'row.' The image accompanying the metadata also shows an individual rowing, further confirming the equipment needed."
