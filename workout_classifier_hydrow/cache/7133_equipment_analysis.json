  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as 'Heat Building Yoga Align' and falls under the category 'On The Mat,' which strongly indicates the use of a yoga mat. The image also shows individuals on mats, supporting the need for this equipment. The phrase 'Move with your breath through sun salutation' suggests a yoga practice that typically uses a mat for comfort and support. Thus, the confidence level for requiring a mat is very high at 0.9. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata."
