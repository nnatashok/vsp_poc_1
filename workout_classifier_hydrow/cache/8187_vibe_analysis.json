  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Tension Release' focuses on stretching and relaxation, evident from phrases like 'gently stretching your neck and back,' 'relax and release any tension,' and the category 'restore.' This makes it a strong match for 'The Reboot Workout' with a score of 0.85, as it aims for a total-body refresh. The use of mellow, downtempo music further enhances the calming and restorative vibe.\n\n'Zen Flow' also fits well, scoring 0.78, due to its grounding and intentional breath-centered movements, suggested by the use of optional yoga blocks and relaxing music, such as those by Yiruma.\n\nFinally, 'The Deep Recharge' scores 0.65, reflecting the workout's intent to ease tension, supported by the soothing playlist and focus on gentle movement. The absence of high-intensity or challenging elements excludes more vigorous vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.' Overall, this analysis is driven by explicit cues in both description and music choice."
