  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout is predominantly a 'Soothing & Restorative' session due to its focus on cooling down and returning heart rate to baseline, as explicitly stated in the description and supported by the playlist of acoustic songs which suggest a calming atmosphere. It scores 0.8 for this spirit.\n\nThe workout also exhibits elements of 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, with a focus on technique and a 'pick drill' format that is methodical in nature, awarding it a score of 0.6. The description emphasizes technique, indicating a structured approach.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is a mild match, scoring 0.4, due to the outdoor rowing setting visible in the image, suggesting an appreciation of the natural maritime environment. However, this does not dominate the session's focus.\n\nThe 'Sport & Agility' and 'High-Energy & Intense' spirits were not relevant here due to the low intensity nature of a cool-down session."
