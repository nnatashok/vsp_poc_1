  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Shoulder Mobility' focuses on opening up the shoulders and upper body in a 'mobility session,' suggesting a gentle and restorative activity, aligned with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which emphasizes low stress and total-body refreshment. The short duration of 5 minutes and 38 seconds supports this classification as a quick and effective session for mobility.\n\nThe absence of high-intensity equipment and use of 'On The Mat' and 'mobility' categories indicate a grounding and intentional session, fitting the 'The Zen Flow' vibe, which centers around breath and relaxed pace. The country and global hits music style doesn't strongly influence intensity, maintaining a calm atmosphere.\n\nThe scores reflect a strong match with 'The Reboot Workout' due to explicit restorative language, and a slightly lower score with 'The Zen Flow,' as the workout is more about functional mobility than meditative practices. Other vibes were excluded since there are no indicators of high intensity or competitive elements."
