  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing-based session described as 'All In One Row' and includes a 45-minute main segment at a 'Sweat' intensity. Rowing workouts naturally blend cardio with a need for basic coordination. Given the metadata indicates a prolonged endurance focus, the technique description aligns with beginner and intermediate levels typical for rowing activities. The technique required is primarily at a moderate level, sufficient for less fit users who can follow simple rhythmic rowing patterns.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of a 61-minute session including warm-up, main intervals at a sustained 'Sweat' intensity, and a cool-down phase. This moderate duration of continuous activity, interspersed with structured high-intensity intervals, suggests moderate to challenging effort for deconditioned users. The 'Sweat' tag and an intensity rating of 2 out of 3 further indicate a moderate to challenging effort requirement, with users needing enough stamina to handle sustained efforts punctuated by rest periods.",
