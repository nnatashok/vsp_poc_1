  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout category is 'row', which restricts the Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The mention of 'Hold the same effort with Aisyah as you climb two sets of ladders' introduces slight complexity as it may imply some coordination. However, the User Fitness Level Requirements indicate 'Beginner', and the intensity level is 1 out of 3, suggesting the movements are largely straightforward, which aligns with a Beginner classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 21:22 and is classified as intensity level 1 out of 3, which suggests low energy expenditure. The term 'Breathe' in the workout type typically implies a focus on steady pace rather than high exertion. Therefore, the effort is predominantly Light, with a slight push towards Moderate due to the rhythm factor of 24, indicating a consistent, but not highly demanding effort.",
