  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout 'Shifting Gears Row' clearly indicates a rowing-focused session. The category 'row' signals that a rowing machine is needed, following the guidelines for this type of workout. The use of the term 'Drive' and the description mentioning 'max effort intervals' strongly imply the necessity of rowing equipment. Although the image depicts outdoor rowing, the indoor rowing machine is essential for recreating a similar workout in a typical exercise setting. Thus, a very high confidence score of 0.9 is assigned to the rowing machine being necessary for this workout."
