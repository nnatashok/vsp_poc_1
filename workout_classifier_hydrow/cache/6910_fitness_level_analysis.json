  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'cool down' lasting 10 minutes, indicating a Light effort difficulty. Cool-downs are inherently low in intensity, designed to help the body transition from exercise to rest, which perfectly aligns with a Light effort categorization. The absence of high energy or high volume cues further supports this classification.",
