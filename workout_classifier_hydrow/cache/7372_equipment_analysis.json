  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the category 'On The Mat,' and the image shows a mat, which suggests that a mat is necessary for performing the exercises. Hence, the confidence level for 'Mat' is very high at 1.0. The description mentions 'Yoga blocks optional,' indicating that blocks might be used for certain exercises, though they are not essential, resulting in a moderate confidence level of 0.4. Since the workout is described as 'Bodyweight Strength,' it implies that no additional equipment beyond possibly a mat and optional blocks is needed."
