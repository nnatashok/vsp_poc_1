  "vibesExplanation": "The \"Miami Beach Warm-Up\" workout features a short climb in rhythm, aligning it with a warm-up categorization. The use of \"Miami Beach lifestyle\" suggests a thematic and potentially fun element, consistent with 'The Groove Session' vibe which emphasizes being in the moment and expressive movement. The playlist includes Latin and Global Hits, contributing to a lively and engaging environment, which supports the \"Nightclub Workout\" vibe with its emphasis on music-driven fun. The workout description doesn't provide intense or meditative aspects, so most other vibes don't apply. Confidence is moderate due to lack of explicit indicators and the absence of specific music genre information, but the lively music playlist and thematic elements guide the vibe classification."
