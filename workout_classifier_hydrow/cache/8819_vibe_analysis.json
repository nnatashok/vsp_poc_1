  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Half-Slide Warm-Up' is characterized by building 'speed and power through bursts of half-slide strokes,' indicating a focus on repetitive motion and endurance, which aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' that emphasizes zoning in and rhythm in rowing. The warm-up nature and short duration (6 minutes) suggest a preparatory, calming focus. The use of 'Pop mid' and 'Global Hits' music indicates a steady and feel-good experience, which moderately aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave' as it hints at elevated energy with positive, sustained movement. The workout is designed to prepare rather than challenge intensely, hence excluding high-intensity vibes like 'The Warrior Workout.' Overall, the metadata supports a primary classification of 'The Meditative Grind' with a complementary element of 'The Endorphin Wave' due to the rhythmic yet energizing approach."
