  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled 'English Bay Stern View', suggesting an outdoor setting focused on enjoying the scenery. The description reinforces this with 'Explore the sights and sounds of Vancouver', indicating that the session takes place in a natural environment, likely on water. This clear emphasis on location and exploration supports a strong match with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, assigning it a score of 0.9. The reference to row on a 'Hydrow' implies it includes rowing with a focus on enjoyment and exploration, rather than competitive training or intense pacing. Additionally, the categorization under 'journey' and the narrative of exploring implies an element of continuous movement, supporting a secondary association with 'Flow & Rhythm', hence a moderate score of 0.5. The absence of music specification and focus on adventure limits the suitability of other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined'."
