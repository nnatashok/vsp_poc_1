  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is classified as 'Drive', which by Hydrow-specific rules suggests a higher technique difficulty, generally classified as 'Advanced'. Although rowing can typically range between Beginner and Intermediate, the emphasis on technical detail and maintaining maximum effort at varying rhythms suggests a higher complexity, justifying an Intermediate score of 0.9 and an Advanced score of 0.7.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is only 11:38 minutes long, yet it requires maintaining maximum effort at varying rhythms. The 'Drive' and 'Climb' format along with a maximum rhythm of 32 indicates high intensity. The workout intensity is rated 3 out of 3, implying it's very demanding. These factors strongly suggest an 'Extreme' effort level with 0.7 score and 'Challenging' with a score of 0.8 due to the short duration.",
