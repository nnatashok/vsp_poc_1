  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Feel Good Row' has a strong meditative aspect as indicated by the description 'steady meters' and 'low rhythms', which align with 'The Meditative Grind'. The use of a low max rhythm and the 'standard,row' category also support this vibe, giving it a score of 0.7. \n\nThe playlist consisting of calming pop songs by artists like Jewel, Taylor Swift, and John Legend suggests a tranquil and soothing experience, leaning towards 'The Zen Flow', where the focus is on grounding and intentional movement. This vibe receives a score of 0.6 due to the emphasis on 'breathing' and the phrase 'Celebrate taking time for yourself'. \n\nThe low intensity level (1 out of 3) and music choices further exclude higher intensity vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout'. The scenic inclusion of the Charles River suggests a calm environment, reinforcing the selected vibes."
