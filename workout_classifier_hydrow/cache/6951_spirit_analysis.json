  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Low Rhythm Cardio Row' is primarily characterized by a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the emphasis on low rhythms and smooth, continuous movement patterns as indicated by the title and description. The description mentions 'intervals at low rhythms' which suggests a focus on pacing and coordination, matching well with the Indie Alternative and Global Hits music which enhance smooth flow. \n\nThe presence of rowing on a river, as shown in the image, aligns with an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Environmental elements further contribute to an adventurous experience. The workout is set outdoors, which enhances this spirit.\n\nA 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is moderately present due to the low intensity level (1 out of 3) and the inclusion in the 'Breathe' category, suggesting a focus on relaxation and recovery. However, the workout's rhythmic and outdoor focus places less emphasis on purely restorative practices. This makes the assignment to 'Soothing & Restorative' a secondary consideration."
