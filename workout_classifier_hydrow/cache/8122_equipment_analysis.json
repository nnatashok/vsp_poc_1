  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's metadata indicates it is a 'row' category, suggesting the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the title 'Pick Drill + Power Warm-Up' and the term 'Technique' imply a focus on rowing-specific exercises. The description mentioning refining technique and muscle activation supports the likelihood that a rowing machine is needed. Although no equipment is listed in the metadata, the category and workout type strongly suggest that a rowing machine is central to this session, justifying a very high confidence score."
