  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Even Press + Stretch Cool-Down' features an image of rowing on a scenic open water body, suggesting a strong \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. This is supported by the photo, which indicates the workout is set outdoors in a natural environment. The workout involves two power strokes on and two strokes off, followed by a light stretch, pointing to a calming, recovery-focused session\u2014matching the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit. The maximum rhythm of 20, along with music tags like 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits', suggests a mellow energy rather than high intensity, reinforcing this classification. The 'cool down' mention further supports the gentle nature of the session, justifying the scores given. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the relaxing and restorative focus of the session."
