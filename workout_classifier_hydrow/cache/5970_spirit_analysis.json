  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title 'Steady Cool Down' and description emphasize unwinding and cooling down, suggesting a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This is further supported by the low maximum rhythm of 22, which indicates a gentle pace ideal for relaxation and recovery. The category 'Cool Down' and the mention of 'steadily cool down' reinforce this focus on calming, restorative movements. The outdoor setting along the Charles River, as depicted in the image, aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, enhancing the natural relaxation element. Although the playlist includes upbeat songs by Maggie Rogers, the overall context still strongly leans towards calm and relaxation. Considering these factors, the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is assigned a high score of 0.9, while 'Outdoor & Adventure' is given a score of 0.8 due to the natural setting."
