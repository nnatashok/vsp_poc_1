  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Club 18 Row' is centered around efficiency and maintaining a steady rhythm, which aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, scoring 0.7. The low-intensity level and emphasis on rhythm suggest a repetitive, endurance-focused session typical of this vibe. Additionally, the use of smooth, pop-oriented music like Santana implies a light, enjoyable energy fit for 'The Endorphin Wave,' scoring 0.6. This energy is uplifting but not overly intense, matching a feel-good, steady build workout. Finally, 'The Groove Session' is suggested by the fun, expressive music choice, scoring 0.5, capturing the fluid movement and expressive quality indicated by the music selection. The moderate confidence level of 0.75 is due to the lack of explicit music genre details and limited intensity clues."
