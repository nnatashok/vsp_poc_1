  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled \"April Race: Week 2 of 4,\" indicates a competitive and high-intensity exercise session, as suggested by terms like \"race\" and the maximum \"3 out of 3\" intensity level. This points strongly to a High-Energy & Intense spirit, which is further supported by the advanced user fitness level requirement and fast-paced music genres such as \"Pop high\" and \"Global Hits\". With a score of 0.9, this spirit represents an extremely strong match.\n\nAdditionally, the workout's setting on the Brazos River in Waco, Texas, suggests an Outdoor & Adventure spirit, as it involves racing on a natural waterway, a key indicator according to the spirit classifications. This environment-based element gives it a score of 0.85, indicating another very strong match.\n\nThe description and category do not emphasize elements like structured progression, soothing recovery, or specific sports skills, which is why other spirits were not considered applicable in this context."
