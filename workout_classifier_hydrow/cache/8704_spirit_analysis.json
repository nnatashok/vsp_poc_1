  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Enhance Your Reward Row' emphasizes high-intensity intervals, indicating a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The description mentions 'hit high-intensity intervals,' and the intensity level is marked as 3 out of 3. The music playlist, featuring remixes of pop hits, suggests a fast-paced environment, further supporting this spirit. The spirit score is set at 0.9 due to these strong indicators.\n\nThe image depicts an outdoor rowing setting on the water, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Since it's a rowing session conducted outdoors, it naturally fits this spirit, with a score of 0.8 due to the evident environment shown in the image. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were considered but excluded due to lack of specific indicators, such as a focus on smooth movement patterns or detailed technical progression."
