  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout category involves rowing, which typically requires maintaining proper form throughout the exercise. Given the 'interval' format, the technique is likely more intricate than basic steady-state rowing. However, as per Hydrow's rowing workout classification, technique difficulty is best classified as Beginner to Intermediate. The strong focus on 'in-depth technical detail' suggests a slightly higher complexity, aligning more with Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The configuration of a 21-minute interval sweat workout with a peak rhythm of 30 implies a moderate level of cardiovascular demand. Participant status shows '2 out of 3' on workout intensity, indicating a workout that is designed to be significantly taxing without reaching maximum exertion. This aligns with a Moderate to Challenging effort difficulty for an audience that may be generally unfit, with Moderate being the most fitting category.",
