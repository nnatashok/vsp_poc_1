  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Afterglow Cool-Down' is primarily a Soothing & Restorative session, as indicated by the title \"Cool-Down\" and the phrase \"let your worries fade away.\" The focus on reflection and steady rowing suggests a gentle, recovery-focused approach, warranting a high score (0.9) for this spirit. \n\nThe Flow & Rhythm spirit is also present, albeit to a lesser degree (score: 0.6), due to the \"steady\" format and the role of music in creating a harmonious and calming experience. The inclusion of indie and global hits enhances the rhythmical element, promoting a connected flow.\n\nThe Outdoor & Adventure spirit is evident from the image depicting rowing on a river, suggesting an outdoor setting. This aligns well with the adventurous aspect of experiencing nature, providing a strong match (score: 0.8) for this spirit, emphasizing exploration in a calming natural environment. \n\nHigh-Energy & Intense, Structured & Disciplined, and Sport & Agility are excluded due to the workout\u2019s explicit focus on cooling down and relaxation."
