  "vibesExplanation": "The workout vibe is primarily \"The Firestarter,\" evidenced by the intense, explosive format described as 'HIIT' and the encouragement to chase low splits, which aligns with short, explosive efforts. The music choice of 00s Hip Hop with mid to high beats and 'Global Hits' further enhances the electrifying atmosphere, common in Firestarter sessions. This workout also fits \"The Warrior Workout\" due to its emphasis on emotional engagement (anger, passion, pride) and high intensity (3 out of 3), with an advanced fitness level requirement, indicating a challenging environment akin to unleashing one's inner beast. Lastly, there are elements of \"The Adrenaline Rush,\" given the unpredictable challenges faced in achieving low splits and the instructor's backstory of overcoming physical setbacks, potentially adding an adrenaline aspect. The vibes are strongly supported by the metadata, though a bit of latitude was taken due to unspecified aspects of the music."
