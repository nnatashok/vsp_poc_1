  "spiritsExplanation": "The Workout Name \"Bergen Challenge Row\" combined with the description indicating a rhythmic and effort-based challenge every 15 seconds aligns strongly with a \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit. The term \"challenge\" and the format \"Power\" emphasize the high intensity and exertion expected in this short workout, leading to a strong match score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the image shows participants rowing on a scenic river, which matches the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. Given that the session is conducted outdoors in a natural setting, this spirit is highly applicable, with a score of 0.8.\n\nThe workout\u2019s \"intensity level: 3 out of 3\" further supports the high-energy classification, and the playlist featuring energetic music like 'Stronger' by The Score aligns with both selected spirits.\n\nOther spirits such as \"Flow & Rhythm\" were not chosen as the primary focus is not on smooth continuous movements but rather on intensity and outdoor elements."
