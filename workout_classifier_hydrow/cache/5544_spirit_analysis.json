  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as \"Soothing & Restorative\" due to the focus on relaxation and lowering heart rate, as indicated by terms like \"cool down\" and \"relaxing.\" The description emphasizes recovery and bringing down heart rate, common in restorative sessions. The music playlist featuring songs like 'Electric Relaxation' by A Tribe Called Quest further supports a soothing atmosphere. \n\nThe inclusion of the river rowing image suggests an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. Rowing on a natural body of water leverages the environment, classifying this element appropriately. This supports an adventure spirit, even though the primary focus remains on relaxation. Given the metadata and visual evidence, \"Soothing & Restorative\" is assigned a higher score of 0.9, and \"Outdoor & Adventure\" a supportive score of 0.7 due to the outdoor context."
