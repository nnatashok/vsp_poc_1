Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout's short duration (11:12 minutes) and the focus on finding stillness in restorative poses, the energy expenditure is very low. This aligns strongly with the Light effort level at 0.9, as restorative yoga typically emphasizes relaxation and slow movement. The presence of any moderate effort level is minimal, which is captured by the 0.2 alignment, suggesting only marginally more effort if participants actively engage in deeper poses or gentle stretching.",
