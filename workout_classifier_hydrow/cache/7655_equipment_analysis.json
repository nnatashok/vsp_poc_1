  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata indicates a focus on power strokes, labeled under the 'row' category, which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. The description mentions an 'even press' during 'power strokes,' typical of rowing exercises, reinforcing the necessity of a rowing machine. The confidence score is high at 0.9 because the category explicitly names 'row,' and the activity described is consistent with indoor rowing practices. There are no mentions or implications of other equipment being needed."
