  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Relax and Reflect Cool-Down' workout exhibits characteristics fitting several vibes. The primary vibe is 'The Reboot Workout,' given its classification as a cool-down activity which aims for a low-stress, refreshing session. The pop and global hits music genre, along with songs like 'Wonder' and 'Where Is My Mind,' enhance the soothing and reflective nature of this vibe. The vibe 'The Endorphin Wave' fits due to the steady rhythm and gentle movement which support a gradual emotional uplift often associated with rowing at a comfortable pace. Additionally, there's a meditative element in 'The Mindful Walk' vibe, as the workout includes reflective storytelling on Hydrow's Alaska trip, encouraging an immersive, contemplative experience. The decision against more intense vibes is based on the format's emphasis on relaxation and reflection, coupled with the absence of high-intensity music or exercises."
