  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which strongly indicates that a rowing machine is required. The title 'English Bay Stern View' and description 'row along English Bay' explicitly mention 'row', supporting the necessity of a rowing machine for this workout. Given the emphasis on rowing with phrases like 'Explore the bridges and buildings of Vancouver as you row', there is very high confidence (1.0) that a rowing machine is central and indispensable for this workout."
