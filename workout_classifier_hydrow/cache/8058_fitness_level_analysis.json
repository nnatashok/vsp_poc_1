  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row,' which indicates that it can only be Beginner or Intermediate in technique difficulty. The description mentions \"climbing intervals,\" suggesting a focus on varying intensity rather than complex techniques. The term 'standard' suggests typical rowing exercises without specialized movements, aligning with Intermediate complexity due to rhythm pacing (max 28), which requires some coordination but not advanced skill.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of just over 16 minutes, combined with the 'sweat' category and an intensity of 2 out of 3, points to a Challenging effort difficulty for less fit users. The focus on climbing intervals indicates a high energy expenditure within a relatively short period, especially for beginners or those not accustomed to rowing. While suitable for an intermediate fitness label, the effort required may feel moderate for those in better shape but challenging for sedentary individuals.",
