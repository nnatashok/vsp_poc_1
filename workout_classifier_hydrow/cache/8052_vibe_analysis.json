  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled \"World Mental Health Day Cool-Down\" explicitly focuses on mental health and reflection, indicating a calming and restorative vibe. The description emphasizes its educational and reflective nature, characteristic of 'The Reboot Workout,' which is suggested by the labels \"cool down\" and \"steady format.\" This is further supported by the duration of just over five minutes and the music genres played, classical and downtempo, which promote relaxation. The repetitive and steady nature of rowing aligns with 'The Meditative Grind,' allowing participants to zone in and reflect quietly. Given that it's a cool-down session with classical music influences, elements of 'The Zen Flow,' known for its unhurried and grounding nature, are present. While intensity is minimal, the focus on thoughtful recovery and education supports a high confidence level of 0.85."
