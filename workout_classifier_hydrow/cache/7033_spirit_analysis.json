  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the emphasis on climbing in rhythm, as mentioned in the description. The playlist includes Pop and Global Hits, which typically aid in creating a rhythmic experience. The low maximum rhythm and moderate intensity level support this classification. This spirit receives a high score of 0.8 for its alignment with the workout's rhythmic focus.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also applicable, given the low intensity level (1 out of 3) and the 'breathe' category, suggesting a gentler, more relaxing session. A score of 0.6 reflects its secondary presence in the workout.\n\nThe image indicates an outdoor rowing session, making 'Outdoor & Adventure' a primary spirit. Engaging with the natural environment and rowing on water falls into this category, resulting in a score of 0.8 due to strong visual evidence. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are less relevant due to the gentle and rhythmic nature of the workout."
