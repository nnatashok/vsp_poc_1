  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified with a High-Energy & Intense spirit due to its cardio focus and the inclusion of rhythmic dance and global music playlists, along with characteristics of a circuit workout that indicates high activity levels. The presence of explicit lyrics along with tracks like 'Humble. (Skrillex Remix)' and 'Promises (Skrillex & Nero Remix)' implies fast-paced, energizing music enhancing intensity (score: 0.7).\n\nThe Structured & Disciplined spirit is chosen for the AMRAP format which denotes a clear structure and discipline in terms of repeating exercises as much as possible within a time frame, thus requiring focus and precision (score: 0.6).\n\nFlow & Rhythm is considered due to the music-driven elements and terms such as 'rhythm' and use of specific mixes that typically encourage rhythm and coordination in movement (score: 0.5). The structured playlist supports a continuous movement pattern typical of this spirit.\n\nThe Outdoor & Adventure spirit is discounted as there is no indication of an outdoor setting. Soothing & Restorative is also excluded due to the emphasis on intensity and work rather than relaxation."
