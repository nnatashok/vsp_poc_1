  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Post-Row Mobility' is primarily classified under 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.9 due to its focus on mobility and recovery, specifically targeting back and hip areas post-rowing. The description emphasizes relaxation and stress reduction, typical of restorative workouts.\n\nThe secondary spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm' is considered with a score of 0.4. The selection of music, including songs like 'Fantasy' by Earth, Wind & Fire, suggests a smooth, rhythmic flow that can facilitate a mind-body connection during mobility exercises.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant, given the video setting by a pool, implying an outdoor environment which contributes moderately to a sense of adventure with a score of 0.5, even though the main focus remains indoors and restorative in nature. This inclusion reflects the natural setting but acknowledges that the primary intent is mobility and recovery."
