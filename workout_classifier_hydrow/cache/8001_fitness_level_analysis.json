  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the category 'row', which aligns with Hydrow-specific rules restricting Technique Difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. Given the 'Club 26' style rowing and the focus on rhythm, there may be some elements requiring coordination, justifying a score for Intermediate. However, the basics of rowing are generally simple, hence a strong Beginner attribution is also warranted.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves a 30-minute 'Club 26' style rowing session, structured as high-intensity intervals, as suggested by the 'Interval' tag and 'sweat' type. This, combined with the described music style, indicates a rhythmic and potentially intense session, contributing to a Moderate to Challenging effort classification. A 46-minute duration with structured warm-up and cool-down adds a moderate demand overall.",
