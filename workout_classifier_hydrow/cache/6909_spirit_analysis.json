  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'De-Stress and Restore Yoga' workout is classified predominantly as 'Soothing & Restorative' due to explicit references in the metadata to calming and restorative elements such as 'relief,' 'calming,' and 'restorative yoga.' The choice of music genre, including 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo,' further emphasizes relaxation, fitting this spirit strongly. This is supported by the workout type being 'restore' and the short duration of 15 minutes, aligning with restorative practices. 'Outdoor & Adventure' also applies due to the outdoor setting by a lake, which contributes an adventurous spirit, although at a lower intensity level, hence a medium score. There are no significant indicators of intensity or structured training, excluding other spirits."
