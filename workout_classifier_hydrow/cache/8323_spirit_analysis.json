  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Steady Cool-Down\" is primarily classified as Soothing & Restorative due to its focus on cool-down activities, as indicated by terms such as \"steady cool-down,\" \"catch your breath,\" and \"stretch out your legs.\" The low rhythm of 20 and the playlist featuring calm, relaxing songs like 'Drift Away' and 'Listen To The Music' further support this classification, leading to a perfect score of 1 for this spirit.\n\nThe image depicts an outdoor setting on a river, which aligns well with the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. Although the primary focus is on restorative actions, the environmental aspect provides a secondary match, justifying a score of 0.7. Other spirits such as High-Energy & Intense or Sport & Agility were excluded due to the lack of intensity and athletic focus in the workout's description and metadata."
