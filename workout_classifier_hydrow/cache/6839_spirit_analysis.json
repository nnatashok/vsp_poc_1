  "spiritsExplanation": "The spirit 'Outdoor & Adventure' is highly suitable (score: 0.9) for this workout based on strong indicators from the metadata. The title 'Hillsborough River Bow View' and the description mentioning 'a trip to Tampa during this quiet afternoon on the Hillsborough River' both suggest a setting that leverages natural terrain and environmental challenges, characteristic of adventure-themed sessions. The category 'journey' further emphasizes an explorative aspect, indicating a rowing session on a river, a defining element for the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. Other spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were not selected due to lack of explicit references to music-driven pacing or recovery focus in the metadata. Thus, the river-based setting and exploration focus makes 'Outdoor & Adventure' the most appropriate classification with high confidence."
