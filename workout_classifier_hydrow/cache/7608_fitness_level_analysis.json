  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' under Hydrow-specific rules is classified at an advanced technical level. However, given the workout is primarily a rowing session, the technique difficulty aligns with Beginner to Intermediate levels due to the focus on consistent rowing pace rather than complex movements. The intervals and max rhythm of 32 indicate a moderate need for coordination but do not elevate it beyond Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The interval format with a max rhythm of 32 and description of \"holding a sprint pace\" followed by a \"max effort at the finish\" suggests a physically demanding session. With a duration of 16:29 minutes, the effort difficulty is high. An intensity level of 3 out of 3 supports a Challenging score, indicating significant energy expenditure and physical demand beyond Moderate difficulty.",
