  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Split Control Row' exhibits a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.8, due to the emphasis on controlling power output and gradually managing speed as mentioned in the description. This indicates a focus on methodical and technical precision. The split control and power format further reinforce this structured nature.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit scores 0.6, supported by the maximum rhythm mentioned and the playlist of popular songs. The music genres 'Pop mid' and 'Global Hits' suggest a rhythmic and engaging experience, promoting a mind-body connection as participants row in sync with the music.\n\nAn 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is present to some extent, scoring 0.5. The presence of rowing on water bodies, as seen in the image, contributes to this classification, providing a natural setting that aligns with outdoor experiences.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are not applicable due to the moderate intensity level and structured format, which lack the qualities of extreme intensity or recovery focus."
