  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'All in One Row' features a continuous 30-minute 'Club 26' row, indicating endurance and repetition, aligning well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe (score 0.7). The use of 'Club 26' and the dance music playlist suggest a nightclub-like euphoria, fitting 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe (score 0.6). The presence of music from the dance and global hits genre, combined with the interval format, supports rhythmic qualities, justifying 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' classification (score 0.5). The explicit lyrics and playlist from Underworld add to the rhythmic and club atmosphere. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggests a strong, steady effort typical of a meditative grind but with elements of expressive rhythm and dance. The descriptor 'sweat' in the type and category also implies sustained effort with enjoyable music-driven motivation."
