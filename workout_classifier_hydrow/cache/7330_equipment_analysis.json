  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, indicating a high likelihood that a rowing machine is necessary. The title 'Get to Know Your Team Row' and the presence of an image displaying individuals in a rowing setup further support the centrality of rowing to this workout.
