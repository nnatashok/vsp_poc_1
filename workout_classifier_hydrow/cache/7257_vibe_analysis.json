  "vibesExplanation": "The selected workout primarily fits 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its rowing-focused nature and emphasis on rhythm. The title '10-Stroke Builders Warm-Up' and description such as 'building in rhythm' align with the repetitive, zone-in quality typical of this vibe. With a score of 0.7, it represents this vibe well.\n\n' \"The Endorphin Wave\" was chosen as well with a score of 0.6. The playlist features upbeat songs like 'Floating Through Space' by Sia and David Guetta, suggesting a feel-good energy, which, combined with the interval format, supports a steady build of energy and endorphins.\n\nLastly, 'The Groove Session' is also relevant, though to a lesser degree (0.4). The 'Dance mid, Global Hits' radio stations imply some level of fun and expressiveness, placing the workout slightly within this vibe. The overall vibes are strongly driven by the rhythmic and upbeat nature of the music and the structured row interval format in this enjoyable warm-up session."
