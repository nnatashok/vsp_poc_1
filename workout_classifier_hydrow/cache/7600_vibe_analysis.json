  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is focused on strength, specifically targeting the hips and glutes, which aligns with 'The Disciplined Grind' due to its structured and goal-focused nature. The use of a mini band emphasizes focused, controlled movements typical in disciplined workouts, warranting a score of 0.7. The outdoor setting overlooking the hills of Dublin suggests a connection to nature and might offer a refreshing element, which is consistent with 'The Nature Flow', scoring 0.5 because of the scenic backdrop enhancing the workout atmosphere. Additionally, the workout's gentle strength and short duration lend aspects of restoration and refreshment, aligning with 'The Reboot Workout', also scoring 0.5. The presence of pop music provides a light, engaging background but does not dominate the vibe. Given the lack of high intensity or complex multi-phase exercise elements, other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Endorphin Wave' were not applicable."
