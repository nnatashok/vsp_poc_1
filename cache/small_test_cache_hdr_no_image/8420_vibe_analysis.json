  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Time Under Tension Row' focuses on building cardio and endurance through intervals, which strongly suggests an 'Endorphin Wave' vibe with its emphasis on elevated energy and feel-good movement (score: 0.7). The indication of rowing and intervals along a scenic location like the Charles River aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' as it involves repetitive and immersive activity (score: 0.6). The use of indie alternative and global hits provides a beat-driven element that can contribute to a 'Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe but is less central without a defined focus on music's role in the workout (score: 0.5). The intensity level is 2 out of 3, aligning with these vibes rather than more extreme or high-intensity profiles like 'The Warrior Workout'. There is reasonable confidence in this analysis given the consistent indicators of interval, rhythm, and endurance-focused rowing."
