  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title \"Climbing Intervals Row\" explicitly mentions rowing, indicating the central role of the rowing machine in this workout. Furthermore, the description and category, which include \"row\" and \"sweat\", affirm that the primary activity involves using a rowing machine. The workout format and emphasis on climbing in rhythm and intensity also strongly suggest that the exercise is structured around the use of a rowing machine to adjust rhythm levels during the intervals. Hence, the confidence score for requiring a rowing machine is very high at 1.0, as it is explicitly mentioned and essential for completing this workout."
