  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video metadata indicates that this is an 'Indoor rowing' session for several reasons. Firstly, the title 'Climbing Intervals Row' and the explicit mention of 'row' in the category tags clearly suggest the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the format description 'Interval' and 'Workout Type: sweat' align with High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) characteristics, emphasizing a structured session with periods of intense effort, which is evident from the climbing rhythm and reducing intervals noted in the description. The intensity level 2 out of 3 suggests a noticeable but manageable workout, which can apply to both rowing and interval training. The combination of these factors provides high confidence for classifying it as both 'Indoor rowing' and 'HIIT.' The use of upbeat music genres (Hip Hop/R&B, Global Hits) also supports the active and rhythmic nature of the workout, commonly found in HIIT sessions, therefore giving strong credence to these categories."
