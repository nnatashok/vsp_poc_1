  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Endurance Intervals Row' with a description focusing on 'letting go of expectations' and 'climbing intervals,' along with a duration of over 16 minutes, suggests a format aligned with sustained effort and a meditative focus on enduring the intervals. The absence of an instructor and the intermediate fitness level requirement also reinforce an autonomously paced and mentally focused effort, which is characteristic of the 'The Meditative Grind,' earning it a strong score of 0.7. Furthermore, the inclusion of rock and global hits music, which are described as 'mid-intensity,' coupled with the rhythmic element ('Max rhythm: 28'), points towards a steady yet energizing experience, apt for 'The Endorphin Wave,' securing a score of 0.6. Other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' are excluded due to the absence of extreme intensity or explosive elements and because the workout does not emphasize primal energy or electrifying effects. Given the structured interval format and moderate intensity, the chosen vibes fit well, but there's some uncertainty regarding the exact emotional quality due to the lack of explicit expressiveness or highly emotive music."
