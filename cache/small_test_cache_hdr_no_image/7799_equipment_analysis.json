  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is specifically a rowing cool-down, as indicated by the workout name 'Feel the Rhythm Cool-Down' and description mentioning rowing at rhythms 22 and 24. Additionally, the category and format emphasize rowing ('cool down', 'standard', 'row', 'interval'), suggesting that a rowing machine is necessary to perform the activities prescribed in the workout. The repeated emphasis on rowing, along with the instructions to practice rowing with closed eyes, strongly implies that the presence of a rowing machine is essential for executing this workout. Thus, there is very high confidence (0.9) that a rowing machine is required."
