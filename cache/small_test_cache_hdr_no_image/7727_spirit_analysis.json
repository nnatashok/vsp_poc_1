  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Cardio Cruise Row' appears to embody the 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits. This is supported by the description of the session as a 'low intensity' workout where participants are encouraged to 'enjoy the music and remind yourself of your intention,' emphasizing a gentle pace and mind-body connection, fitting the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The playlist features classic and globally recognized tracks from the 60s and 70s, which suggests a calming and familiar auditory environment, enhancing the rhythmic flow of the workout.\n\nAdditionally, the narrative of a 'breathe' workout type and the low intensity level (1 out of 3) strongly align with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, focusing on relaxation and gentle recovery. The terms \u2018breathe\u2019 and \u2018intention\u2019 indicate a workout structured to alleviate stress rather than induce high energy exertion. The 'Interval' format suggests some structure but is mitigated by the workout's overall low intensity focus, making other spirits less applicable."
