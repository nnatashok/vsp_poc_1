  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Climbing Intervals Row' and the category tag 'row' strongly indicate the use of a 'Rowing machine', with a very high confidence score of 0.9. The term 'Row' is a clear indicator that rowing is central to the exercise, which confirms the need for a rowing machine. Furthermore, the description mentions 'intervals shifting up in rhythm', which is common in rowing workouts where pace variations are emphasized. There is no indication of other equipment being necessary or mentioned explicitly in the metadata, suggesting that the rowing machine is the primary, if not the only, equipment needed for this workout."
