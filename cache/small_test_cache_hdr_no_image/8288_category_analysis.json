  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'HIIT' and 'Indoor rowing' based on several pieces of metadata evidence. The title 'Rock HIIT Row' clearly includes 'HIIT,' indicating a High-Intensity Interval Training format. This is explicitly corroborated in the description, which states participants will 'push for high-intensity intervals.' The workout's intensity is confirmed with a 3 out of 3 levels, further supporting its HIIT nature. Additionally, there is a rowing component as indicated by terms 'row' in the title and 'drive' in the workout type, hinting at activities commonly associated with indoor rowing machines. The combination of rock music and high-intensity metrics ('Max rhythm: 30') aligns with a dynamic workout typically seen in HIIT. Other categories were excluded as the workout does not fit the characteristics of non-rowing or low-intensity categories."
