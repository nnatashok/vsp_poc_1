  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Welcome to Norway Flow', indicating a primary focus on 'Flow & Rhythm', supported by the description emphasizing a 'core-focused flow'. The presence of terms like 'serene surroundings' and references to Norway as a 'Destination' suggest a connection to 'Outdoor & Adventure' environments, although the actual workout is 'On The Mat'. The playlist, featuring chill and downtempo music genres, aligns with 'Flow & Rhythm' and supports a continuous, rhythm-based exercise (score 0.9). These elements also contribute to a 'Soothing & Restorative' atmosphere, reflected in the calming music (score 0.7). Given the focus on exploration of serene locations and gentle pacing, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is included with moderate confidence (score 0.5). The metadata lacks indicators for 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', or 'Sport & Agility', hence they were excluded."
