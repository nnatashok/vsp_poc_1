  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title \"Running + Sprinting Pace Row\" and the category tags such as 'row' strongly indicate the need for a rowing machine. The format of the workout involves \"2.5-minute intervals\" with a \"max rhythm of 28\" which is consistent with interval training that incorporates rowing. Additionally, the word 'row' explicitly relates to rowing activity. While the title suggests a running and sprinting element, the primary focus appears to be on rowing given the lack of any mention of treadmills or similar equipment. Therefore, the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high at 0.9."
