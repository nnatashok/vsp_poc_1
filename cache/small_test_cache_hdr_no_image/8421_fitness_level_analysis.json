Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.75,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The description and metadata suggest a moderate level of energy involvement given the 20-minute duration. This timeframe and the 'fire up your core' directive imply that while the intensity may rise, the effort difficulty is primarily moderate with some sections perhaps on the lighter end due to resting periods inherent in on-the-mat workouts. Thus, it scores 0.8 for Moderate due to consistent but not excessive exertion and 0.4 for Light because of the downtempo music and possible gentle pacing.",
