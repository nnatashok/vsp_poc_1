  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified is 'The Warrior Workout' with a score of 0.9. This is strongly supported by explicit indicators of high intensity and the workout's format as HIIT. The name 'Rage Row' itself evokes a primal energy, and the format mentions 60-second intervals, which align perfectly with a sweaty, heart-pounding experience. The lack of an instructor suggests a focus on personal drive and intensity, rather than technique or progression, aligning with a Warrior vibe.\n\n'Ride Station: Hip Hop/R&B Mid, Global Hits' further supports a Warrior Vibe, as intense beats often accompany intense workout sessions.\n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Competitor' with a score of 0.6, indicating a strong but not primary match. The structured nature of 60-second intervals could evoke a competitive environment, suitable for advanced users.\n\nA tertiary vibe is 'The Nightclub Workout' with a score of 0.5, justified by the playlist choice featuring popular, upbeat hits that could elevate the workout to a euphoric, music-driven experience. However, the core intensity focuses more on raw energy than euphoric flow, making this a secondary aspect."
