  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Time Under Tension Row,' and is classified under the categories 'Sweat,' 'standard,' and 'row,' which explicitly suggests the need for a rowing machine. The description further emphasizes building cardio and endurance 'during intervals along the Charles River,' which metaphorically represents a rowing experience. This indicates that the rowing machine is central to the workout, thus justifying a confidence score of 1.0. The metadata does not suggest the need for any additional equipment beyond the rowing machine."
