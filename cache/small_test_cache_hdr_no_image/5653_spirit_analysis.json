  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.85 due to the clear indication from the name 'HIIT Strength' and the description mentioning 'Get your heart rate up' which highlights a focus on high intensity. The use of terms like 'HIIT style workout' suggests a fast-paced and effortful session typical of high-energy workouts. The playlist featuring energetic, upbeat dance and global hits further reinforces the intense and energetic nature of the workout. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is given a secondary, lower score of 0.4 due to the presence of rhythmic tracks which could facilitate a sense of flow during the session. However, the primary focus on intensity and heart rate elevation makes it a weaker fit. Other spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the lack of mentions of structured training protocols or relaxation emphasis in the metadata. The absence of elements relating to specific sports skills or outdoor environments also precludes classifications under 'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure.'"
