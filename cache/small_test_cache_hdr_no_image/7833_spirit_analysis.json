  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Advanced HIIT Row' strongly embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as indicated by the use of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which is designed to maximize effort and elevate heart rates ('maximum effort'). The workout's intensity level is marked as '3 out of 3,' underscoring its vigorous nature. The playlist features upbeat, dynamic songs, such as 'Untouched' and 'So What,' which align with a high-energy atmosphere, further supported by the description focusing on 'high rhythms.' This merits a perfect score of 1.0 for the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit.\n\nThe workout also aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a score of 0.6. The mention of reaching 'high rhythms' and the coordination of movement to music ('all female artist playlist') suggest an emphasis on synchronization and dynamic flow throughout the rowing session. Lastly, the structured format of HIIT and the focus on music-driven pacing support this identification. However, the emphasis remains primarily on intensity over rhythm, explaining a lower score of 0.6."
