  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Climbing Intervals Warm-Up' workout is predominantly characterized by the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The description directly references 'rhythm' with phrases like 'climb up in rhythm with Aquil,' suggesting a music-driven, continuous movement pattern that aligns with the Flow & Rhythm spirit. The playlist includes dance tracks and global hits, which are likely to contribute to a rhythm-focused and engaging experience, justifying a high score of 0.8 for this spirit. The format 'Climb' and the categorization as a 'warm-up' imply a gentle introduction, which partially aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, focused on preparing the body, suggesting a lower match score of 0.4 for enhancing relaxation and readiness. No indicators support intense, highly structured training, sports-specificity, or an outdoor environment, hence these spirits are excluded."
