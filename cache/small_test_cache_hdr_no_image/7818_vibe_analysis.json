  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'The Meditative Grind' due to its focus on steady rhythm at stroke rate 22 and repetitive segments focused on different body parts (arms, core, legs). The description emphasizes consistent, rhythmic rowing, a hallmark of this vibe. The music genre (Indie Alternative, Global Hits) supports a calm and mindful atmosphere, aligning with 'The Meditative Grind' (score 0.8). Additionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is a relevant vibe given the workout's steady build and beginner-friendly nature, with an emphasis on gradual engagement (score 0.6). The music playlist, including artists like Death Cab For Cutie and Olivia Rodrigo, adds an emotive, motivating background that enhances the endorphin-boosting quality. Lastly, 'The Reboot Workout' is considered due to the low intensity level and 'breathe' categorization coupled with a slow pace, offering elements of refreshment (score 0.4). Other vibes were excluded as the workout lacks the explosive, high-intensity, or competitive aspects of those categories."
