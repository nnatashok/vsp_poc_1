  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration (5 minutes and 44 seconds) and the classification as a 'cool down' suggest minimal physical exertion. Cool downs are intended to bring the body to a resting state, indicating low intensity and energy expenditure. Therefore, this workout aligns strongly with a 'Light' effort difficulty. The use of steady format and music tracks intended for a relaxed atmosphere supports this classification.",
