  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'Drive' category, a term specific to Hydrow workouts indicating advanced-level rowing technique. Additionally, the rhythm maxes at 32, which requires a good level of coordination and skill to maintain correct rowing form at this intensity. The workout requires engaging multiple muscle groups effectively, which aligns significantly with Advanced technique difficulty. The brief accumulation of evidence hints at a possible minimal overlap with Expert due to the intensity and fast-paced nature, but the primary classification remains Advanced.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 21 minutes with a max rhythm of 32 and HIIT format suggests significant physical demand. The high intensity level of 3 out of 3 indicates that the workout requires considerable physical effort, aligning strongly with Challenging effort difficulty for most users. Furthermore, the 'Drive' workout type emphasizes both speed and power, suggesting a partial alignment with Extreme effort difficulty in terms of energy expenditure and endurance required.",
