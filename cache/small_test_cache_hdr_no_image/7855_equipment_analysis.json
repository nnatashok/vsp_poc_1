  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title 'Express Bootcamp HIIT Row' and the category tags 'Drive, standard, row' indicate that the workout primarily involves rowing activities. The mention of '50-second intervals at a rhythm 26 and 10-second intervals at a rhythm 32' suggests that a rowing machine is central to the workout, as these specified rhythms correspond to the strokes per minute typical in rowing workouts. The high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format also aligns with activities performed on a rowing machine. Therefore, the confidence score for the rowing machine is assigned at 1.0 due to these explicit references and the central role of rowing in the workout structure."
