Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 21 minutes, which is moderate in length but not overly demanding. The emphasis is on 'flow,' typically suggesting a mild continuous movement likely centered on moderate core engagement and flexibility rather than strenuous exertion. The playlist's chill and downtempo genre supports a calming atmosphere, indicating a lower intensity format, justifying a 'Light' to 'Moderate' effort difficulty. The absence of high-intensity cues aligns with this classification.",
