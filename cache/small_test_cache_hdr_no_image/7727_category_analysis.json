  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category, 'Indoor rowing', is determined by the workout name 'Cardio Cruise Row' indicating the use of a rowing machine, alongside the description specifying it as a 'low intensity, longer workout', which is characteristic of some rowing sessions. The mention of 'Row' and 'interval' format supports this classification, leading to a high confidence score of 0.8.\n\nThe secondary category, 'Breathing exercises', is selected because the description and workout type explicitly mention 'breathe' and 'intention', aligning with focused breathing practices. Furthermore, the emphasis on lower intensity and rhythm (max 26) with a focus on music and intention, rather than purely physical exertion, further supports this. Hence, a score of 0.6 is given.\n\nThe 'low intensity' and mention of 'intention', often associated with mindfulness formats, disqualify more strenuous categories like 'HIIT'. There\u2019s no evidence suggesting equipment other than a rowing machine or relevance to categories such as 'Mat', 'Yoga', 'Weight workout', etc."
