  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Post-Row Align Yoga' and described as a session focused on the hips, hamstrings, and spine, which strongly indicates a Soothing & Restorative spirit. The use of terms like 'align' and 'designed for right after a row' suggests a focus on recovery and relaxation after an intense activity, contributing to a high score (0.8) for the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The presence of chill and downtempo music further supports this classification by promoting a calm and relaxing atmosphere. Meanwhile, the Flow & Rhythm spirit is relevant due to the term 'Move through' in the description, indicating a session with smooth, flowing movements, and the idea of yoga itself often being rhythm-driven. The music helps create a rhythmic quality to the workout, justifying a moderate score (0.6) for Flow & Rhythm. Other spirits were excluded due to lack of high-energy, competitive, or outdoor adventure elements in the description and setup."
