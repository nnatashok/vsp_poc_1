  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Post-Row Align Yoga' is designed for a calming and restorative experience following a rowing session. The description emphasizes movements focusing on the 'hips, hamstrings and spine', which suggests a stretching and alignment focus common in yoga. The vibe of 'The Reboot Workout' is highly appropriate here as it is associated with 'deep stretch, low stress, total-body refresh'. This aligns closely with the purpose of post-exercise recovery yoga. The score of 0.8 reflects the strong match.\n\nAdditionally, the music playlist, featuring 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' radio stations and relaxed remix tracks like those by Darius and Kygo, supports a calming and grounding atmosphere, akin to 'The Zen Flow' vibe, which is described as 'Grounding, intentional, breath-centered, unhurried'. This is particularly evident with smooth, relaxing tracks. Thus, this vibe is given a score of 0.7.\n\nOther vibes such as 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Nature Flow' were considered but deemed less fitting due to the specific post-row recovery context and the lack of an outdoor setting."
