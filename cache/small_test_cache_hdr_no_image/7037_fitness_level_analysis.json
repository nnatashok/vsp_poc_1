Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is a short 5-minute stretch focusing on specific muscle groups post-row, indicating low physical demand. Stretching usually involves very low energy expenditure and minimal physical strain, especially when targeting specific areas like the hip flexors and adductors. This session involves resting and static positions rather than dynamic movements, substantiating it as 'Light' effort. Vocabulary like 'stretch' and 'post-row' implies a restorative and easy-going activity, reinforcing the Light effort classification.",
