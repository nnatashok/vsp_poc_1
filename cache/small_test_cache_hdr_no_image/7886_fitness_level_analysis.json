  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Drive' which indicates a high technical challenge inherent in maintaining proper rowing form especially at an intensity max rhythm of 32+. \"Drive\" workouts on Hydrow often require advanced knowledge of technique, body awareness, and coordination due to the need for effective stroke mechanics. Therefore, this aligns strongly with the Advanced level (1.0) and moderately with Expert (0.6) due to the technique complexity inherent in sustaining proper form at such pace.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's short duration of 11 minutes but with high-intensity intervals of max rhythm 32+ implies a very demanding session. A 'HIIT' format, classified as intensity level 3 out of 3, indicates substantial energy expenditure in quick succession effort, justifying a Challenging difficulty (1.0) and indicating significant overlap with Extreme (0.7) despite its short duration because of the intense nature.",
