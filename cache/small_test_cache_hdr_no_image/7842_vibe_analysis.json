  "vibesExplanation": "The workout features a combination of lower body and core strength exercises with a quick pace, suggesting a strong rhythmic element, characterized by quick movements such as squats and lunges. The playlist includes remix tracks with a danceable beat (e.g., Dua Lipa's 'Hotter Than Hell' and Lizzo's 'Good As Hell'), indicating an energetic and music-driven atmosphere. These tracks align closely with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, meant to be beat-driven and strong but fluid, earning a score of 0.8 given the prominent role of music in setting the workout pace.\n\nAdditionally, with the energetic and expressive music plus the inclusion of dance-focused remixes and global hits stations, 'The Groove Session' is also a fitting vibe, warranting a score of 0.6 due to the workout's fluid and in-the-moment aura.\n\nThe mention of yoga blocks suggests a possibly meditative component or flexibility needed between exercises, slightly aligning this with 'The Meditative Grind', though to a lesser extent (score 0.4). The unlikelihood of a pure meditative grind is because the workout focus is on dynamic movement rather than repetitive endurance, explaining the moderate score."
