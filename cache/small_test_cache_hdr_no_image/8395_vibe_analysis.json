  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled \"Core Engagement + Stretch Cool-Down\" primarily indicates a cool-down or recovery session, combining rowing and stretches. 'Steadily row' and 'steady format' suggest rhythmic and repetitive action, which aligns with 'The Meditative Grind,' earning it a score of 0.8 as it captures the endurance-focused, repetitive nature typical of rowing. The inclusion of 'engage your core' plus stretches aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' as a cooldown encourages low stress and recovery, justifying a score of 0.7. Additionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' captures the steady build in energy potentially sustained during rowing, thus a 0.6. The music comprises 'Rock low' and 'Global Hits,' implying a calming, engaging atmosphere. Lack of intense, electric music or language excludes the more intense or upbeat vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Nightclub Workout.' The confidence is moderate as the music genre is not specified and the light rock genre mostly infers a calm, steady vibe."
