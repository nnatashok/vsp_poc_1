  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is best classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence level of 0.8. The title 'Steady Cool-Down' and the description indicating a focus on steadily decreasing heart rate suggest a workout aimed at recovery and relaxation, which is essential to the Soothing & Restorative spirit. This is further supported by the categorization as 'Cool Down,' reinforcing its recovery focus. The rowing along the Charles River also contributes to a relaxing and restorative atmosphere, along with the steady 24 rhythm which does not imply high intensity. The lack of intensity and focus on cool down makes it an ideal candidate for this spirit.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' also fits this workout with a moderate confidence of 0.6. The phrase 'Max rhythm: 24' indicates a smooth, rhythmic approach, and the music playlists ('Pop low, Global Hits') suggest a gentle, continuous movement pattern, which aligns with Flow & Rhythm, though it is secondary to the primary restorative nature."
