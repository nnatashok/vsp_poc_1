  "vibesExplanation": "The workout \"Rock HIIT Row\" primarily aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe due to its high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format. The description emphasizes high-intensity intervals, and the workout is categorized as having an intensity level of 3 out of 3, suggesting a very demanding session, perfect for 'The Warrior Workout' which embodies sweat-dripping, heart-pounding energy. The inclusion of rock music, with tracks from artists like 'The Cranberries' and 'Fall Out Boy', adds a powerful and energizing backdrop, reinforcing the primal energy associated with 'The Warrior Workout'. This is why it scored a 0.9 for this vibe.\n\n'\"The Firestarter\" vibe is also relevant, as the workout involves short, explosive HIIT segments, indicated in the description and supported by the rhythmic and energetic rock music, leading to a score of 0.65.\n\nThere is a moderate connection to 'The Nightclub Workout' because rock music can promote a lively and engaging atmosphere, similar to a nightclub setting, but it's less about dance and more about intense movement, thus receiving a lower score of 0.4. The overall confidence in classification is high at 0.85, based on explicit indicators such as the workout format, intensity, and music choice."
