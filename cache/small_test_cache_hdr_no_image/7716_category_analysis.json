  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout title 'Rhythm 30 HIIT Row' explicitly mentions rowing and HIIT, which directs the classification towards these categories. The description further confirms this by detailing the workout structure, consisting of 1-minute intervals at rhythm 30 with recovery periods, which aligns with HIIT principles of alternating intense exercise and rest. Additionally, the term 'footboards' indicates the use of rowing machines, confirming the 'Indoor rowing' category with high confidence (score 0.9) as the central activity. The intense nature of the workout, rated 3 out of 3 for intensity, and specific interval training format support the classification into 'HIIT' (score 0.8). Other categories, such as 'Mat', 'Body weight', or 'Weight workout', do not fit since the workout does not involve floor exercises or resistance training."
