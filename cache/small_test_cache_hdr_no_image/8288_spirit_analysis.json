  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'High-Energy & Intense', strongly indicated by the description mentioning 'high-intensity intervals' and a focus on 'pushing' participants, coupled with an intensity level of 3 out of 3. The use of 'HIIT', which stands for High-Intensity Interval Training, further underscores this classification. Additionally, the playlist featuring energetic rock songs like 'Centuries' and 'Paralyzer' contributes to a dynamic and vigorous atmosphere, justifying a high score of 0.9. \n\nA secondary spirit could be 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the emphasis on jamming out to rock music, which suggests a coordination of exercise movements with the music's rhythm. The mention of 'max rhythm: 30' aligns with this concept, thereby meriting a moderate score of 0.6. Other spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined', 'Soothing & Restorative', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded as there is no emphasis on precise structure, recovery, sports specificity, or outdoor/nature elements."
