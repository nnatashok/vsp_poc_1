  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Joyful Intention Row' workout is classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative'. The use of the term \"jog pace\" suggests a smooth, continuous movement, common in 'Flow & Rhythm' workouts, especially given the pyramid format which implies varying intensity levels that help maintain a dynamic flow. The playlist, featuring songs by Donovan and Blue \u00d6yster Cult, suggests a rhythmic experience, supporting the 'Flow & Rhythm' classification. The score of 0.75 reflects a strong match with this spirit due to the clear emphasis on maintaining a continuous, rhythmic state rather than high intensity.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is supported by the 'breathe' category and the low-intensity level (1 out of 3), indicating a focus on relaxation and mindfulness. The beginner fitness level targeted by the workout aligns with a restorative approach. The score of 0.65 for this spirit reflects its moderate fit, as the workout appears to balance being both rhythmically engaging and restorative without the presence of emphasis on healing or recovery-specific language. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the lower intensity and lack of systematic technical focus."
