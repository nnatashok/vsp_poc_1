  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title \"Restorative Yoga\" and category tags like \"On The Mat\" strongly suggest the use of a mat, as yoga practices typically involve mat work for comfort and support. The description mentions moving through poses, which are standard in yoga practices, further implying the use of a mat. With a confidence level of 0.9, it is clear that a mat is central and necessary for performing this restorative yoga workout. No other equipment is explicitly or implicitly required as the restorative nature of the workout focuses on gentle movement and poses, which are typically mat-centered activities."
