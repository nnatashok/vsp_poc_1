  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Racing Rock Row', which strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. The metadata lists the workout category as 'row', and the description mentions 'tackle high rhythm numbers', which suggests a focus on maintaining pace on a rowing machine. The term 'Drive' in both the format and category also suggests rowing, as 'drive' is a common term associated with the rowing stroke. Given these clear indicators, there is very high confidence (1.0) that a rowing machine is the primary equipment needed for this workout."
