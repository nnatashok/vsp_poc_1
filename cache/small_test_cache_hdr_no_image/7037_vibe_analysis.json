  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Post-Row Stretch' workout focuses on stretching specific muscle groups, namely the hip flexors and adductors, as mentioned in the description. This aligns well with the vibe of 'The Reboot Workout', which is characterized by deep stretch and total-body refreshment. The brief duration of 5 minutes and 45 seconds suggests it is designed to complement a rowing session rather than serve as a standalone workout, further supporting the rebooting aspect. The music playlist features artists like Kygo and Leftfield, known for producing tracks with a chill vibe, which fits the 'Zen Flow' classification that involves grounding and breath-centered activities. While the vibe is not entirely meditative, the emphasis on stretching and the choice of music suggest a calming and restorative intention, rather than high intensity or technique-driven focus. The confidence level is moderate due to the lack of detailed description about the intensity or specific style of the stretching routine, but the available metadata leads to a reasonable inference of these vibes."
