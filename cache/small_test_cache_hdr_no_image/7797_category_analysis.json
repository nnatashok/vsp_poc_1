  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 0.9, based on the context provided by the metadata. The phrase 'Row steadily along the Charles River with Mac' indicates the use of a rowing machine, as rowing is mentioned explicitly and typically aligns strongly with indoor rowing sessions. The setting of rowing, albeit virtual, implies that the workout is conducted on a rowing ergometer, hence the high confidence in classifying it under 'Indoor rowing'. Additionally, 'Cool Down' and 'Steady' format suggest a relaxed rowing pace, appropriate for a cool-down session. \n\nThe 'Stretching' category is considered as secondary with a score of 0.6. This is inferred from the 'cool down' description, which often includes stretching exercises to aid in recovery after more intense physical activity. While the primary focus is on rowing, the cooling down aspect implies stretching elements, justifying inclusion at a lower confidence. Other categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Mat' were not considered, as there's no evidence of yoga poses or general mat exercises in the metadata."
