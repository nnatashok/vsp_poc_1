  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'cool down' session with a specific emphasis on 'reinforcing technique.' The inclusion of the term 'row' in the Category field strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the mention of 'Max rhythm: 22' is relevant to rowing, where cadence (strokes per minute) is a key metric. Therefore, I have a very high confidence (0.8) that a rowing machine is needed for this workout, as it is central to the activity and relevant details are provided in the metadata. No other equipment is mentioned or implied; thus, the focus is on the rowing machine."
