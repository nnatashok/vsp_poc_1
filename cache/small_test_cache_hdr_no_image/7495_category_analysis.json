  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Runner's Program #1 of 9', suggesting a focus on exercises beneficial for runners. The description mentions 'mobility and functional movement', suggesting exercises typically performed on the floor or mat. Additionally, 'strength building exercises' implies some level of resistance training, likely using body weight given the lack of specified equipment. The category noted as 'On The Mat' further reinforces this environment, hence the selection of 'Mat' with a score of 0.7 and 'Body weight' with a score of 0.4. The indirect reference to running indicates a mild presence of running-specific conditioning, warranting a score of 0.2 for 'Running'. The workout duration of approximately 21 minutes supports a moderate-to-high confidence in categorizing this as a mix of mat-based and strength exercises with a focus on running support. Other categories like 'Pilates', 'Yoga', or 'Treadmill' are excluded due to lack of direct indicators."
