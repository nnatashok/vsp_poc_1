  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, 'Foot + Ankle Focused Yoga,' showcases a primary emphasis on careful and mindful movements, aimed at enhancing foot and ankle strength and mobility, which aligns strongly with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, hence a score of 0.75. The description of the setting 'overlooking the Boston Harbor' introduces a calming and peaceful atmosphere, consistent with restorative practices. The music selection featuring 'chill low' and 'cool/downtempo' genres further supports a tranquil and relaxing environment. Yoga is inherently about flow and rhythm, with an emphasis on movement and coordination, though the specific focus on the feet and ankles suggests a less pronounced embodiment of 'Flow & Rhythm,' meriting a score of 0.55. Additionally, the outdoor setting hints at a touch of 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, as the harbor setting provides a sense of embracing the natural environment, although the structured nature of a mat-based workout indoors diminishes this, earning it a score of 0.3. There is little to suggest high energy, structure, or sports agility elements in this session, thus these spirits were excluded."
