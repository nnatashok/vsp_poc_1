  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is predominantly classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to several explicit indicators in the metadata. The title 'Rage Row' suggests releasing frustration through vigorous activity, and the description highlights a 'high-intensity session with 60-second intervals,' indicative of a demanding, energy-expending workout. Furthermore, the format is specified as HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training), which is synonymous with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, and the intensity level is marked 3 out of 3, affirming the rigorous nature. The playlist features high-energy tracks from artists like Flo Rida and Lil Nas X, complementing the intense vibe.\n\nA secondary classification of 'Flow & Rhythm' is warranted, with a moderate score of 0.6, due to the music-driven nature of the session. The presence of popular rhythmic tracks and phrases like 'Max rhythm: 32+' indicate that maintaining a certain tempo and rhythm is integral to the workout, creating a rhythmic flow alongside the intense effort.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the lack of evidence of structured protocols beyond standard intervals or relaxation-focused elements."
