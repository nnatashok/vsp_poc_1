  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'cool down with Mike as you row,' which strongly indicates it involves rowing. The mention of rhythms 22 and 24, along with interval formats, further supports this classification as an 'Indoor rowing' workout, earning a high score of 0.9 since it explicitly involves rowing. The cool-down nature suggests a relaxed pace, but still within the context of rowing. The additional mention of practicing rowing with eyes closed suggests a focus on rhythm and form rather than high intensity or cardio. The secondary category 'Mat' is included with a lower score of 0.3 due to the rhythmic and possibly stationary nature of the workout, but it is primarily for diversification, acknowledging that cooldowns can occasionally encompass basic stretching movements common to mat exercises. Other categories like Stretching, Meditation, or Yoga were considered but not included due to the presence of rowing-specific context."
