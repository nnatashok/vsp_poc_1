  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of rowing, categorized under 'sweat' and 'standard', indicating fundamental rowing exercises. Rowing at intervals is generally straightforward but requires maintaining proper technique to avoid fatigue and injury, making it suitable for beginners with potential slight complexity for intermediates. There's no mention of technical or complex maneuvers required, hence a strong alignment with Beginner (0.7) and partial with Intermediate due to interval training format (0.3).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout spans 31 minutes with interval training involving 4-minutes and 45-second durations. The maximum rhythm of 30 suggests moderate intensity rowing, which could be challenging for some beginners. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 fits moderately across effort levels. Hence, it's moderate due to duration and interval setup, but could be challenging due to sustained effort, with strong alignment to Moderate (0.75) and some to Challenging (0.25).",
