  "categoriesExplanation": "The title 'Express Bootcamp HIIT Row' and description indicate a combination of high-intensity interval training ('HIIT') with rowing ('Row'). The workout is specifically structured with '50-second intervals' and '10-second intervals' matching typical HIIT workout patterns of alternating exercise and rest periods. 'Max rhythm: 32' and 'Format: HIIT' further corroborate the high-intensity nature. The 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3' implies a very high intensity, suitable for HIIT. 'Category: drive,standard,row' also points to a rowing machine workout, and the typical pop 'Radio Stations Played' aligns with energetic music suitable for HIIT. Thus, 'Indoor rowing' is a central defining characteristic (score: 0.9), and 'HIIT' is clearly evident (score: 0.8). Other potential categories, like 'Mat' or 'Weight workout', were excluded due to a lack of relevant indicators."
