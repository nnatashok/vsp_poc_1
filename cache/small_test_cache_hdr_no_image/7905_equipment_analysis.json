  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled 'Bodyweight Strength' and its description suggest that it focuses on using bodyweight to build strength and stability. The 'Category' specifically lists 'On The Mat,' which implies that exercises are performed on the floor, likely without additional equipment. The emphasis on engaging the core and building stability strongly indicates a bodyweight routine, with no mention of any external equipment such as dumbbells, bands, or machines. Therefore, based on the title, categories, and description, the workout appears to be designed to be performed using just the body and potentially a mat for comfort, but since mats are considered basic for any floor workout, they aren't listed unless otherwise emphasized. This analysis leads to the conclusion that no additional workout equipment is required for this session."
