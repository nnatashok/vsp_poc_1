  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Peppy HIIT Row' is classified primarily under 'Indoor rowing' and 'HIIT'. The title explicitly mentions 'HIIT Row', indicating a combination of high-intensity interval training with rowing exercises. This is reinforced by the description mentioning '30-second and 60-second intervals', a characteristic of interval training, typically associated with HIIT. The title and metadata specify the use of rowing, indicated by terms like 'row' and 'along the shores of Hanover', confirming the primary equipment used is a rowing machine. The metadata also describes the workout as having an intensity level of 3 out of 3, further supporting the classification as HIIT. The consistent use of the term 'row' suggests a central focus on rowing exercises, justifying a high score for the 'Indoor rowing' category. The music genre and playlist, while energetic and vibrant, primarily support the high-energy element rather than indicating a different workout type. No other categories, such as 'Mat' or 'Body weight', were applicable due to the lack of related exercises."
