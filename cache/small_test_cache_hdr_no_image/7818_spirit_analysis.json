  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Steady Fundamentals Row' with a rhythm focus and steady pacing at a rhythm of 22 indicates a significant element of 'Flow & Rhythm'. The explicit mention of maintaining a rhythm aligns well with this spirit, suggesting a workout that emphasizes smoothing and continuous movement patterns. Hence, the score of 0.75 due to the music pacing and rhythm aim. \n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also relevant given the segmentation of focus on different body parts (arms, core, legs) every 5 minutes, showcasing a methodical approach to training. The structured segments support technical precision and progressive training, warranting a score of 0.7. \n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is not as applicable here despite the lower intensity level and the 'breathe' category, as the structure and rhythm focus suggests an active engagement rather than pure relaxation. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the workout's lower intensity and lack of athletic performance aspects."
