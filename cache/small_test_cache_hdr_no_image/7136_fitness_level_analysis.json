  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's short duration (under 11 minutes) and its categorization as a 'restore' type exercise strongly suggest a low physical demand, aligning with a Light effort level. The focus on breath and stillness, typical of restorative practices, usually include low-intensity stretches or poses designed primarily to promote relaxation rather than physical exertion. Additionally, the music selection characterized as Chill and Cool/Downtempo supports a calm, light intensity setting (score: 0.95).",
