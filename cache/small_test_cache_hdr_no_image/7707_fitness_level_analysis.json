  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is classified primarily at the Beginner level with a score of 0.8. The metadata indicates that the workout is a rhythm 18 row described as a steady rowing pace with an emphasis on 'practicing patience.' Additionally, the 'breathe' type suggests focus on controlled, steady-paced rowing rather than complex movements. There is a weak indication of Intermediate handling due to the rowing rhythm (some coordination required), which is reflected in a lower score of 0.2 for that level.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified at the Light level with a score of 0.8, given the 16-minute duration, a maximum rhythm of 18 per the steady format, and an intensity level marked as 1 out of 3. The description of 'breathe' and 'jogging pace' supports a light effort classification suitable for beginners. However, if participants push themselves slightly higher due to rhythm intensity, it could border on Moderate, hence the 0.2 score for Moderate.",
