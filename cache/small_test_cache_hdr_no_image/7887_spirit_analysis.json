  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Climbing Intervals Row' closely aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to its focus on climbing in rhythm, as explicitly mentioned in the description and title. The inclusion of hip-hop and global hits in the music playlist further suggests strong rhythmic and musical elements, justifying a score of 0.75.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is also relevant as indicated by terms like 'sweat' and 'endurance' in the metadata. The playlist includes songs with energetic themes, such as 'Adrenaline!' and 'Motivate,' suggesting an engaging and motivating experience, hence a score of 0.65.\n\nThere are elements of 'Structured & Disciplined' due to the interval format and planned progression of reduced duration, which shows a methodical approach to training, giving it a score of 0.6. The lack of any clear mention of restoration, outdoor adventure, or sports-specific agility allows the exclusion of those spirits from consideration."
