  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized by 2.5-minute high-effort intervals, which indicates explosive energy, aligning well with 'The Firestarter' vibe, especially considering its association with the workout type 'sweat' and 'standard row'. The use of energetic songs from the Shrek movies soundtrack, such as 'All Star', 'Livin' La Vida Loca', and 'Joker And The Thief', enhances the fast-paced and electric feel of the intervals, which is a hallmark of 'The Firestarter'. This results in a high score of 0.85 as it strongly embodies a short, intense workout experience. Additionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is appropriate due to the 21-minute duration featuring steady-state rowing which builds and releases energy, while being driven by upbeat and globally popular pop hits. The long intervals and music genre imply sustained energetic movement, characteristic of a feel-good, steady build wave of endorphins. It merits a score of 0.75 as it also captures the workout's steady build and rhythmically upbeat nature. The 'Meditative Grind' was considered but the music and interval nature shift it towards the more energetic and rhythmic vibes."
