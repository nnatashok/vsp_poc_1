  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'On The Mat,' which strongly suggests the use of a mat for floor exercises, consistent with workouts that are typically performed with movements requiring comfort and support on the floor. Keywords like 'HIIT Strength' imply that the workout involves high-intensity intervals and strength exercises, which can often include bodyweight movements that benefit from using a mat. The inclusion under 'On The Mat' further supports a very high confidence level that a mat is needed, as it is explicitly part of the workout category."
