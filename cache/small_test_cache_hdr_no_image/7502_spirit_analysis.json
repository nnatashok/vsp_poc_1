  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Runner's Program #8 of 9' is a session specifically designed for runners, focusing on strengthening the hips and core through Pilates. This indicates a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit due to the targeted, methodical approach aimed at improving specific runner-related muscles, earning it a score of 0.7. The explicit mention of a Pilates session suggests a smooth, flowing quality typical of 'Flow & Rhythm' exercises, especially with the inclusion of popular, rhythm-driven music tracks that likely maintain a continuous movement pattern, hence a score of 0.65. The 'Sport & Agility' spirit is also relevant given the runner's focus, as strengthening areas such as hips and core are key for enhancing sports performance, earning it a score of 0.6. Other spirits were excluded as the focus is on sport-specific strengthening rather than intense cardio, soothing activities, or outdoor features."
