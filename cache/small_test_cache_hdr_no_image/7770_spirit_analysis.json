  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is strongly classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to several explicit indicators: the format 'HIIT', the workout intensity being listed at the maximum level '3 out of 3', and user fitness level recommendations that are advanced. Additionally, the details of '1-minute intervals' suggest a high exertion level typical of intense training sessions (Score: 0.9).\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is supported by the setting 'Nord\u00e5svannet Bay' in Norway and the description referring to it as a 'newest Destination'. This suggests a focus on environment and exploration, which fits 'Outdoor & Adventure' moderately well (Score: 0.7).\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is included because of the music-driven nature of the workout, with popular and upbeat tracks that may promote fluid and rhythmic movement, though this spirit is less dominant compared to the others (Score: 0.4).\n\nOther spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are less relevant due to the energetic and spontaneous nature of HIIT and the described setting."
