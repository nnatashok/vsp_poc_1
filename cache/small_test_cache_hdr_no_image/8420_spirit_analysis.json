  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout spirit for this session primarily embodies 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.7. This is supported by the description referencing intervals and a max rhythm of 28, indicating a focus on maintaining a steady pace and coordination. The rhythmic nature of rowing to music genres such as Indie Alternative and Global Hits further supports this classification.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is also applicable, scoring 0.65. The workout is described as 'sweat' focused with a moderate intensity level, suitable for intermediate users, which implies a session designed to elevate heart rate and push exertion levels.\n\nFinally, 'Structured & Disciplined' scores 0.6 due to the interval format and time-under-tension focus, which requires methodical execution and adherence to a set protocol. \n\nThe intervals and environmental description of being 'along the Charles River' hint at 'Outdoor & Adventure', but not enough specifics are provided to warrant a strong classification there. The user comments and nature of the session exclude more restorative, sport-specific, or highly adventure-focused spirits, as these elements are not emphasized in the metadata provided."
