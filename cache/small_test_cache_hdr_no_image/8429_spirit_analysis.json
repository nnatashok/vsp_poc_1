  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.9 due to the use of descriptors like 'ignite your legs and lungs,' and 'bolt down the Charles River,' which suggest a fast-paced, vigorous rowing session. The workout intensity level being 3 out of 3 further supports this classification, as does the inclusion of high-energy rock music that typically drives such intense sessions. The 'Racing Mindset Row' implies a strong emphasis on performance and competition, aligning with 'Sport & Agility' as a secondary spirit (score 0.7). This is further supported by the term 'drive' in the workout type, indicating a focus on powerful, sustained efforts typical in sports training. The structured nature of a 'HIIT' format and the rhythmic elements implied by a max rhythm of 32 suggest the presence of 'Structured & Disciplined', though to a slightly lesser degree (score 0.6), as the structure of intervals often requires precision and discipline. The lack of a noted outdoor element reduces the likelihood of 'Outdoor & Adventure,' and there is no emphasis on recovery or relaxation to consider 'Soothing & Restorative.'"
