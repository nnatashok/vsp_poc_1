  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Effort Focused Row,' which strongly indicates the primary activity involves rowing. The description further confirms this, as it mentions maintaining a split while rowing at different rhythms under the guidance of instructors, Aisyah and Nick. The workout is formatted as interval training and falls under the categories 'standard' and 'row,' reinforcing that rowing is central to the workout. There is no mention of any other equipment, and the duration of 16 minutes and 46 seconds suggests a focused, rowing-specific session. Based on these factors, the confidence score for needing a rowing machine is very high, rated at 1.0, since it is explicitly required to perform the workout as described."
