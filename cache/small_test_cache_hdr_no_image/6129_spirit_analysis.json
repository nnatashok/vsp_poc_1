  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Restorative Yoga\" clearly suggests a calming and healing type of session, indicated by both the title and description which highlight gentle movement and spending time in each pose. The classification of 'restore' and inclusion in the 'On The Mat' category further supports this, making 'Soothing & Restorative' an extremely strong match with a score of 0.9. The calm and relaxing nature of the workout is also supported by the music genre being labeled 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo,' aligning with a \u2018Soothing & Restorative\u2019 spirit.\n\nThe mention of the workout being conducted in Lucerne, Switzerland implies an outdoor setting, which suggests a slight 'Outdoor & Adventure' aspect due to the environmental exploration component. However, there is less emphasis on the adventurous or challenging environmental aspects as the primary focus is restorative yoga. Hence, this spirit is assigned a lower score of 0.4.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the workout's gentle nature and lack of structured, high-intensity elements."
