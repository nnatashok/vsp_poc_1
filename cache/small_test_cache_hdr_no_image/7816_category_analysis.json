  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category 'Indoor rowing' is supported by multiple explicit indicators: the workout name 'Learn and Burn Row,' the description specifying 'steadily row at rhythm 22,' and the workout type 'row.' Additionally, the use of terms such as 'rhythm 22' and 'steady' rowing aligns with a rowing workout. This results in a very high confidence level of 0.9 for Indoor Rowing as it is the central element of the workout.\n\nThe second category, 'Breathing exercises,' is assigned with a moderate confidence level of 0.5. The workout type mentions 'breathe,' suggesting a focus on rhythmic breathing. However, the emphasis seems less pronounced compared to the rowing aspect, justifying a lower score. The inclusion of meditative or relaxing music could further support this.\n\nThe moderate intensity level '1 out of 3' aligns well with a potentially relaxed rowing pace combined with breathing focus but doesn't indicate Stretching, Meditation, or Yoga, meaning these categories were not selected. No equipment or environment suggesting another workout category was found, ensuring clarity in category selection."
