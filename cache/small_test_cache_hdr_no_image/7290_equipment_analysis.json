  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Newport Beach HIIT Row,' indicating a high-intensity interval training session focused on rowing. The word 'Row' in the title directly implies the use of a rowing machine for this workout. The description further supports this with references to 'intervals' and 'drive,' which are commonly associated with rowing exercises. Additionally, the category tags include 'row,' providing further evidence. Given these repeated references, there is very high confidence (0.9) that the rowing machine is central to this workout, essential for its intended high-intensity interval format. No other equipment is suggested or implied in the metadata."
