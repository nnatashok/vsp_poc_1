Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 16 minutes and the description 'beginner friendly' highlight a lower energy expenditure and overall exertion. The 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' music supports a relaxed pace, aligning more with the Light level of Effort Difficulty. Thus, it primarily demands minimal physical exertion, justifying a Light classification with high confidence.",
