  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Bootcamp HIIT Row' workout strongly aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe due to its high intensity (level 3 out of 3) and the HIIT format, suggesting a demanding session designed to push limits. The use of 'Bootcamp' in the title further indicates a focus on primal energy and rigorous exertion, supporting a 0.75 score. Additionally, the 'Endorphin Wave' vibe is relevant given the 21-minute duration, promoting endurance and sustained energy. The music selections and 'Drive, standard, row' emphasis corroborate this, justifying a 0.6 score. Furthermore, the playlist choice with radio stations like 'Dance high' and 'Global Hits' hints at 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe, as these choices suggest an upbeat and energizing musical atmosphere, common in dance-focused settings, hence a 0.5 score. The absence of an instructor involved does not detract from these vibes, given the strong other indicators present."
