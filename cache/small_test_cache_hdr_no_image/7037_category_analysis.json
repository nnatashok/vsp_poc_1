  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Stretching' with a score of 0.95, due to explicit mention in both the workout name 'Post-Row Stretch' and the description which states a focus on stretching hip flexors and adductors. These are clear indicators of a stretching-focused session. The metadata, including category tags 'On The Mat' and the short duration of 5 minutes 45 seconds, supports this classification as a dedicated stretching activity following rowing. Additionally, the 'Mat' category is relevant, scoring 0.65, based on the metadata's categorization under 'On The Mat,' implying floor-based exercises typically involving an exercise mat. No mention of rowing activity or equipment suggests that this is conducted off the rowing machine, reinforcing the mat-based nature. Other categories like 'Yoga' or 'Pilates' are excluded due to lack of evidence of relevant exercises or practices."
