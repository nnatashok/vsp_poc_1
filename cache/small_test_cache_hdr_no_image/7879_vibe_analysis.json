  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, 'Recovery Cool-Down,' is explicitly identified as a cooldown session aimed at preparing individuals for future workouts, aligning perfectly with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe. This vibe focuses on recovery and low-stress activities, which is precisely what a cooldown session entails. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong match due to the focus on preparation, cooling the body down, and reinforcing technique, all elements of a refreshing and restorative workout. \n\nAdditionally, the playlist includes artists like Kylie Minogue and Sam Smith, known for uplifting, energetic tracks often associated with a feel-good vibe, aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave,' which is characterized by elevated energy and feel-good movement. However, as this is a cooldown with a steady rhythm and a focus on reinforcement rather than vigorous activity, this vibe scores a 0.6. The moderate match indicates that while the music contributes to a feel-good endorphin release, the primary function remains recovery-focused."
