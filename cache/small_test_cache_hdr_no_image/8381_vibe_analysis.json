  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is classified primarily as 'The Firestarter' due to the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format, the maximum rhythm of 32 SPM, and a top intensity level of 3 out of 3. The short duration of 21 minutes and the focus on explosive, energy-driven rowing further substantiate this vibe. The music genre from radio stations like 'Dance high' and 'Global Hits', as well as songs by artists like Pitbull and Ne-Yo, aligns with a 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe, suggesting a vibrant, club-like atmosphere. 'The Endorphin Wave' is also perceptible due to the steady energy and motivational tracks like 'Pompeii' and 'Gotta Get Thru This', creating a feel-good progression through the workout. Confidence levels are high given the strong contextual cues from workout intensity, format, and music selection. The combination of short duration, high energy, and dance music makes both 'The Firestarter' and 'The Nightclub Workout' strong matches."
