  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Back Bends Align' suggests a focus on backbends, which are common in both Yoga and Stretching routines. The use of terms such as 'align' and 'on the mat' further supports these categories as they are indicative of exercises often performed on a mat, typically linked to Yoga or Stretching. The description suggests a relaxed start and warming up, aligning with the nature of these workouts. The playlist, characterized by chill and downtempo music, reinforces an atmosphere suitable for Yoga or Stretching. Given the 15-minute duration, this workout likely involves gentle stretching or yoga flow targeting alignment and flexibility. Therefore, Yoga is assigned a score of 0.75 due to strong alignment with backbend practices and mat-based exercises, whereas Stretching is marked at 0.7 for its emphasis on flexibility and warm-up."
