  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Beginner Yoga Flow' strongly aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe due to its grounding and intentional focus, suitable for all levels, and the soothing backdrop of scenic Achill Island. Key elements of the metadata, such as 'beginner friendly flow,' 'scenic Achill Island,' and 'yoga,' emphasize a calming and breath-centered approach. This suggests a serene, unhurried quality synonymous with The Zen Flow vibe.\n\nThe inclusion of music characterized by genres such as Chill mid and Cool/Downtempo\u2014featuring artists like RY X and R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL\u2014supports this classification, providing a calm, rhythmic soundtrack that enhances the peacefulness of the session. These elements collectively justify a high score of 0.9 for The Zen Flow.\n\nAdditionally, there are elements of 'The Groove Session,' as the music contributes to a fun, fluid experience, making this session somewhat expressive in the moment. However, the primary focus on a beginner-friendly and serene flow limits its alignment with The Groove Session, hence a moderate score of 0.5."
