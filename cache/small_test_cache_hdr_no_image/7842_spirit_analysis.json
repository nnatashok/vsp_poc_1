  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Lower Body + Core Strength' incorporates elements that suggest a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The description mentions a 'quick pace' for exercises such as squats and lunges, combined with core exercises, indicating a dynamic and sweat-inducing session characteristic of high-energy workouts. This aligns with the use of upbeat, remixed tracks in the playlist, featuring artists like Dua Lipa, Lizzo, and Vicetone, suggesting a vigorous and motivating atmosphere. Thus, a score of 0.75 for 'High-Energy & Intense' is justified.\n\n'Sport & Agility' is also an applicable spirit, though less prominently. The focus on lower body exercises and core strength, typical of athletic conditioning, aligns somewhat with this spirit. The playlist's energetic nature also promotes agility and movement, warranting a score of 0.55. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' was considered due to the potentially rhythmic nature of the quick-paced movements and musical accompaniment, but the emphasis on core strength and lower body exercises, coupled with the description, suggests a more intense workout, leading to its exclusion."
