  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Peppy HIIT Row' workout combines high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with a strong musical element, suggested by the use of energetic 90s pop punk and global hits. The high intensity level of 3 out of 3, and the advanced fitness level requirement, point towards 'The Warrior Workout' vibe, as it encourages releasing primal energy with sweat-dripping exertion (score: 0.7). The short 16-minute duration paired with explosive intervals aligns with 'The Firestarter' vibe, characterized by its fast-paced and electrifying nature (score: 0.6). Additionally, the playlist featuring upbeat, recognizable songs and the setting 'along the shores of Hanover' with charismatic music suggests a 'Nightclub Workout' atmosphere, focusing on music-driven energy and full-body engagement (score: 0.6). The combination of music and movement hints at an immersive and dynamic workout experience, though lacking explicit descriptors like 'dance' to earn a higher confidence for the 'Nightclub Workout' classification."
