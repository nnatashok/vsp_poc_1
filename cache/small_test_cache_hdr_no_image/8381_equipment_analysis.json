  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Pure Energy Row' and the category tags 'Drive,standard,row' strongly suggest that this session centers around rowing, meaning a rowing machine is essential for performing the workout effectively. Additionally, the description mentions 'high-intensity intervals along the Charles River,' which implies a simulated rowing experience. These consistent references indicate a very high likelihood (0.9 confidence) that a rowing machine is needed. No other equipment is mentioned or implied, as the focus is solely on the rowing activity."
