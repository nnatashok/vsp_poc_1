  "vibesExplanation": "The metadata suggests a 'Meditative Grind' vibe due to the steady rhythm (22) and the format being described as 'breathe', indicating a focus on sustained, repetitive, and mindful rowing. The inclusion of Scandinavian mythology implies a mentally engaging element, enhancing the contemplative nature of the workout. The low intensity level (1 out of 3) further supports a meditative pace, with music choices like 'One Of Us' by Joan Osborne and 'God Only Knows' by The Beach Boys complementing this vibe.\n\n'Pop low' and 'Global Hits' stations suggest a gentle, accessible energy that aligns with a 'Mindful Walk' vibe, engaging participants in a guided, immersive experience. The lack of an instructor and the beginner fitness level requirement highlight a self-guided, entry-level approach. The 'Mindful Walk' score is lower as the workout is not literally walking but shares the narrative-driven aspect.Overall, the steady pace, focus on mythology, and easy-listening music align closely with the 'Meditative Grind' and 'Mindful Walk' vibes."
