  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title 'Consistency Row' and the description which mentions 'Maintain a consistent split as Mike leads you through sets of intervals' strongly indicate the use of a rowing machine. The metadata includes 'row' in the category section, which further supports this conclusion. Additionally, the use of a rowing machine is central to achieving a consistent split and executing interval workouts effectively. Given these factors, there is very high confidence (0.9) that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
