  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of 'The Meditative Grind' was chosen due to the workout's emphasis on maintaining a steady rhythm and focusing on effort control, which suggests a repetitive and enduring experience typical of rowing workouts. The usage of terms like 'effort focused' and 'control your effort' aligns with this vibe, making it a strong match (score 0.7). Additionally, the low intensity level (1 out of 3) and the 'Breathe' categorization support this assessment, suggesting a calm, focused workout. The choice of music, with dance and global hits, infuses energy into the session, which is why 'The Endorphin Wave' was also selected with a score of 0.6. The playlist's tracks such as 'Levels (Radio Edit)' by Avicii and 'I Took A Pill In Ibiza (Seeb Remix)' by Mike Posner are known for their upbeat nature, contributing to an elevated, feel-good atmosphere, characteristic of this vibe. The lack of an instructor and the focus on breathing reinforce the meditative aspect, while the music introduces an element of positivity and energy. Other intense vibes like 'The Firestarter' or 'The Warrior Workout' were excluded due to the low intensity and beginner level, along with the lack of any extreme or competitive elements."
