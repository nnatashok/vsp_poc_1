  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Newport Beach HIIT Row,\" clearly indicating a high-intensity training session focused on vigorous rowing intervals. The description elaborates that the workout consists of 'ten sets of 1-minute high intensity intervals' and gives a maximum rhythm of 34 strokes per minute, suggesting a demanding and rigorous session commonly associated with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe. The intensity level is rated as 3 out of 3, supporting a very high confidence (0.9 score) in this vibe due to its intense and primal energy.\n\nThe music playlist featuring rock and global hits, along with songs like 'The Final Countdown' and 'Good Vibrations,' infuses an electrifying and fast-paced energy that aligns with 'The Firestarter' vibe. The combination of high-energy songs and short, powerful bursts of effort with advanced user fitness requirements provide a strong match (0.75 score) for this vibe.\n\nOther vibes were excluded due to the focused high-intensity and short-duration nature of the workout, which doesn't align with vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Zen Flow,' making our confidence in the selected vibes high at 0.85."
