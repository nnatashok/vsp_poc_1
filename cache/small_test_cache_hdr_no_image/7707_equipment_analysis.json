  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is named 'Rhythm 18 Row' and the description mentions rowing steadily, which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. The 'row' keyword in both the workout name and description indicates that rowing is central to this session. Additionally, it's categorized under 'row', further corroborating the need for a rowing machine. The context provided, such as 'steady rhythm' and 'jogging pace', are typical of workouts conducted on a rowing machine. Given the high centrality of rowing to the session, a confidence score of 0.95 is warranted."
