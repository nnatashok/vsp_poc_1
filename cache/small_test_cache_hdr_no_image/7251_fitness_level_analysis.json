Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of approximately 21 minutes and described as four rounds of exercises, this workout suggests a sustained effort. The music choice (Dance mid, Global Hits) indicates a tempo that supports moderate to challenging activity. The 'strength' category implies a focus on muscle endurance, contributing to a moderate energy expenditure, potentially challenging for less fit individuals. Thus, the effort difficulty is rated mostly 'Moderate' with some 'Challenging' elements due to the repeated rounds.",
