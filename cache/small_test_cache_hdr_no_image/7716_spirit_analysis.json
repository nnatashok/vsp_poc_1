  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is predominantly classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the HIIT format, which involves short bursts of maximum effort and intensity, indicated by phrases like 'Exert max pressure' and '1-minute intervals at rhythm 30'. The workout intensity level of 3 out of 3 further supports this classification, suggesting a focus on pushing physical limits. The music playlist, consisting of high-energy tracks such as 'She's So Mean' and 'Savior', complements the vigorous workout effort.\n\nAdditionally, the spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm' is present due to the specified 'rhythm 30' in 1-minute intervals. This aspect indicates coordination in timing with either the music or movement pattern, aligning with attributes of maintaining a rhythmic flow throughout.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' was not the primary choice due to the lack of detailed progressive training elements or technical precision focus, excluding its relevance. The absence of environmental factors or specific sports elements rules out 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Sport & Agility' as primary spirits."
