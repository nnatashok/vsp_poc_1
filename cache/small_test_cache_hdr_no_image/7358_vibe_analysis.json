  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized by a 'Consistent Effort' theme, with an emphasis on maintaining steady rhythms of 20 to 24, which aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, as it suggests a repetitive, focused approach typical of steady rowing or cycling sessions. The duration of 21 minutes and 18 seconds and the beginner fitness level further support this classification, offering an accessible endurance component. The music consists of rock and global hits with songs like 'It's Not My Time' and '(Don't Fear) The Reaper', which are energetic yet not overpowering, fitting the 'Endorphin Wave' vibe, moderately elevating the mood through steady-state cardio. Given the low intensity (1 out of 3) and focus on maintaining rhythm rather than explosive exertion, 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' are excluded, as is 'The Nightclub Workout', due to the lack of highly intense or rhythmic dance elements. The consistent effort and phrasing align more with a meditative state and a feel-good endorphin experience rather than adrenaline-pumping or technique-heavy sessions, indicating moderate confidence overall."
