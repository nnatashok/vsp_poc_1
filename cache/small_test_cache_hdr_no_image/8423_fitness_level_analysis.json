  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves rowing, which is typically a low-complexity exercise, albeit one that requires good coordination for optimal efficiency. It involves rhythmic strokes that beginners can grasp, although proper form benefits from some practice, indicating a balance between Beginner and Intermediate. Given the format is 'intervals', some variability in stroke rate and power may add to difficulty, warranting an Intermediate score but mostly Beginner-friendly.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 31-minute workout includes warm-up, interval training, and cool-down periods. With a 'sweat' intensity label and an intensity level of 2 out of 3, it suggests moderate effort overall. Intervals and a high rhythm (max 28) increase the intensity above a simple steady-state row, slightly challenging for deconditioned users, but primarily moderate as there is room for rest during intervals.",
