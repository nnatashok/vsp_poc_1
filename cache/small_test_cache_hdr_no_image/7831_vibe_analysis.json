  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Cardio Intervals Row' has a short duration of just over 11 minutes, involving shifting rhythm intervals, which matches the explosive and intense qualities of 'The Firestarter' vibe. The presence of upbeat dance and global hits supplement this with energy indicative of a fast-paced workout. The description also emphasizes 'getting sweaty' and 'elevating heart rate', reinforcing this classification. Moreover, the playlist featuring songs like 'Party Rock Anthem' and 'I Love It' lends itself to a dance-party atmosphere, aligning with 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe, hence its inclusion. Finally, the interval format and focus on rhythm can promote a steady energy build throughout the session, suggesting 'The Endorphin Wave', albeit to a lesser extent due to less explicit emphasis on prolonged endurance common to that vibe. Overall, the confidence level is 0.75, based on strong music cues and format indicators despite some uncertainty in workout intensity specifics."
