  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily focused on bodyweight strength exercises, indicating elements of 'The Endorphin Wave' due to its steady, feel-good movement typical of endurance or strength-building routines. The session duration of 20 minutes aligns with the idea of an elevated yet manageable energy level, earning it a score of 0.8. Secondly, the playlist consisting of dance and club mixes, such as 'Somebody To Love (Club Mix)' and 'Up Till Dawn (On The Move) [Club Radio Mix]', injects a fun and expressive element to the workout, pushing it towards 'The Groove Session' vibe, thus scoring 0.7. The use of well-known global hits further supports a vibrant and engaging atmosphere. However, the absence of a specified music genre and instructor introduces some ambiguity in the emotional tone, resulting in a confidence level of 0.65 for these vibes. The setting in Seville, with no explicit competitive or meditative indicators, excludes other vibes like 'The Competitor' or 'The Meditative Grind.'"
