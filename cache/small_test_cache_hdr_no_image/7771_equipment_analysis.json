  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Steady Adventure Row,' which directly suggests that it is a rowing workout, and this is further supported by the term 'row' included in the category and the focus on maintaining a consistent split. The description explicitly mentions working on your pace through intervals, which is a common exercise format on a rowing machine. The term 'standard' in the category might refer to the typical equipment used for such workouts, reinforcing the need for a rowing machine. Therefore, with very high confidence, a rowing machine is required for this workout."
