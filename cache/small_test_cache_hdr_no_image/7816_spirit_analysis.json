  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Learn and Burn Row' is centered around steady rhythm rowing with a focus on Scandinavian mythology. This suggests a smooth flow and coordination, aligning well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The specified rhythm of 22 strokes per minute further supports this, as it tends to encourage a consistent pacing rather than an intense interval-style workout. The description emphasizes learning, which indicates a mindful component, enhancing the mind-body connection typical of 'Flow & Rhythm'. The workout is marked at a low intensity level (1 out of 3) and for beginners, suggesting a gentle engagement rather than exhaustive effort, aligning moderately with 'Soothing & Restorative'. The playlist featuring softer pop hits complements the more restorative nature by creating a calming atmosphere. Absence of any elements indicating high intensity, sports performance, strict structure, or outdoor exploration rules out other spirits. The scores reflect a strong match with 'Flow & Rhythm' and a moderate alignment with 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit."
