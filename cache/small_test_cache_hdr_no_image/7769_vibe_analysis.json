  "vibesExplanation": "The classification of this workout primarily aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe due to the mention of a \"gentle and smooth rhythm\" and the setting at sunset, which suggests a calming, grounding experience. The format is specified as \"Steady,\" aligning with the unhurried and intentional qualities of Zen Flow. The music genre, primarily Hip Hop/R&B, along with tracks featuring artists like Frank Ocean and Tyler, The Creator, supports a laid-back yet emotionally resonant atmosphere, enhancing the Zen Flow feel. This vibe is scored at 0.8 due to the strong alignment with zen-like qualities. \n'The Reboot Workout' is a secondary vibe due to the workout being labeled as a \"cool down\" in nature, aiming for a total body refresh, which corresponds with the \"low stress\" and \"refresh\" aspects of a Reboot workout. However, this alignment is more secondary to the Zen focus and thus is scored at 0.6. The absence of high intensity or competitive elements excludes vibes like The Warrior Workout or The Competitor."
