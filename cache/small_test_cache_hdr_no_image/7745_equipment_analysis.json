  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'August Race: Week 3 of 5', which suggests a structured training program. The description highlights 'explode with power and speed during 5-minute pieces with Mac before going all out for a final 1-minute effort', indicating an interval training session. The metadata includes keywords such as 'drive' and 'row' under the 'Category', implying the use of a rowing machine. The maximum rhythm and power format are typical of indoor rowing workouts, reinforcing the requirement for a rowing machine. The high intensity level (3 out of 3) also aligns with rowing exercises, where power and speed are emphasized. Thus, the confidence score for requiring a rowing machine is very high at 1.0."
