  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout falls under the category of \"On The Mat,\" which strongly implies that a mat is needed for the exercises involved. This category suggests floor-based exercises or mobility work that typically require a mat to provide comfort and stability. The mention of \"mobility and functional movement\" for runners indicates exercises that might involve movements like stretching or bodyweight exercises, where a mat would be beneficial for cushioning and balance. This inference leads to a very high confidence score of 0.9 for requiring a mat. The absence of other specific equipment mentioned or implied in the metadata supports focusing on the mat as the primary equipment."
