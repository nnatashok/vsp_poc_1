  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is called 'Instructional: Drive Through Your Feet,' indicating a focus on technique, which is a hallmark of 'The Masterclass Workout.' The description reinforces this by emphasizing foot placement and form, aimed at skill-building during a legs-only drill. This justifies a high confidence and an 0.8 score for 'The Masterclass Workout' due to its clear technical focus.\n\nFurthermore, the specific focus on proper form and foundational technique aligns well with 'The Foundation Builder' vibe, as it aims to strengthen basics and address potential weak points in rowing technique. The legs-only drill emphasizes foundational movement patterns, earning this vibe a 0.7 score.\n\nThe music, such as '1 Thing (Instrumental)' and '99 Red Balloons,' is known for being upbeat but not excessively intense, which supports the instructional and foundational nature without overpowering with high energy. Confidence in these vibes is high due to explicit focus on instruction, skill enhancement, and foundational movement in the metadata."
