  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Learn and Burn Row' combines elements of learning and exercise, featuring whales and orcas education while rowing. The use of indie alternative and global hits music, along with artist tracks such as 'Sunflower' by Post Malone and 'Dreams' by The Cranberries, supports a 'Groove Session' vibe, characterized by fluid, in-the-moment activity. The moderate intensity (2 out of 3) and 16-minute duration suggest a balance between effort and enjoyment, leaning towards 'The Meditative Grind' due to the repetitive nature of rowing with an educational angle, focusing more on enduring with rhythm. The HIIT format and intermediate fitness level align lightly with 'The Endorphin Wave,' as these elements build energizing motion, creating physical exertion and enjoyment. However, it's less intense compared to typical HIIT, hence a lower score. The vibes confidence is high given clear indicators, despite the indie and global hits music genres being nonspecific."
