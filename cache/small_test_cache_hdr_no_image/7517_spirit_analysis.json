  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout emphasizes increasing rhythm and effort through 2.5-minute intervals, suggesting a strong 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, supported by the 'sweat' category and an intensity level of 2 out of 3. The use of upbeat songs from Shrek, including 'All Star' and 'Livin' La Vida Loca', further supports this high-energy classification. Additionally, the playlist featuring rhythmic and popular anthems implies a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, indicated by phrases like 'Increase your rhythm' and the playlist driven by popular tunes that likely enhance coordination with the workout pacing. 'Structured & Disciplined' is also present due to the interval format, encouraging methodical progression and targeted effort intervals. Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the focus on intensity and indoor rowing format."
