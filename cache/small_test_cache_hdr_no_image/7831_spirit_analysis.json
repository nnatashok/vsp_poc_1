  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to its emphasis on elevating heart rate and sweating, as explicitly mentioned in the description. The use of terms like 'Cardio Intervals' and 'Workout Type: sweat' suggests a fast-paced, challenging session, reinforced by the intermediate fitness level requirement, which supports a score of 0.75. The 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' radio stations indicate energetic music. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also applicable because the description mentions 'intervals shifting in rhythm,' indicating a coordination focus with music-driven pacing and continuous movements, leading to a score of 0.65. The playlist further supports this spirit, with lively songs that likely aid in maintaining a rhythm-driven session. \n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit was considered due to the 'Interval' format, but it appears less pronounced, as the focus seems primarily on energy and rhythm rather than strict technical precision, thus not selected. \n\nConfidence is relatively high at 0.78, given the clear indicators, though the absence of a specific instructor and detailed visuals leaves some room for interpretation."
