  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'All in One Row' has clear indicators of being 'The Meditative Grind' due to its rowing nature and structured progression into different intervals (warm-up, sweat intensity, cooldown). The rowing focus and interval format suggest repetitive and meditative elements. The moderate duration of 31 minutes and the sweat intensity level further imply sustained effort, typical in endurance-based, mentally-focused workouts. \n\nThe inclusion of 90's and Global Hits music with explicit lyrics, combined with a mix of energetic and nostalgic songs like 'Send Me On My Way' and 'Knockin' On Heaven's Door,' contribute to a positive, immersive experience, which aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave' as it provides elevated, feel-good energy suitable for a steady build through intermediate intensity levels.\n\nThe confidence is moderate to high (0.72) due to clear metadata indicators, though slight uncertainty remains as the lack of specific music genre limits full certainty. The workout does not align with more explosive or gamified vibes due to its format and intended intensity level."
