  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Foot + Ankle Focused Yoga', which strongly suggests that the central focus is a yoga session, specifically aimed at improving movement and strength in the foot and ankle regions. This is further supported by the description emphasizing movement and strength and the use of the term 'align', which is commonly associated with yoga practices to indicate a focus on alignment and posture. The category tags 'On The Mat' and 'on-the-mat' further support the classification as 'Mat', as yoga is predominantly performed on a mat. The playlist and music genre, featuring chill and downtempo styles, support a calm and focused session typical of yoga. Therefore, 'Yoga' was assigned with a very high confidence score (0.9) as the main category due to the explicit use of the word, and 'Mat' with medium confidence (0.6) to account for the format, even though it's a secondary aspect in this context."
