  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Instructional: Drive Through Your Feet' suggests a focus on technique and form, indicated by phrases like 'Prioritize proper foot placement' and 'legs-only drill.' This emphasis on proper form and specific drills aligns well with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, justifying a high confidence score (0.75) for this spirit. The mention of an 'instructional' context further supports this classification. The music selection, featuring upbeat and mainstream songs, implies an element of rhythm which can align with 'Flow & Rhythm.' This spirit is further supported by the continuous nature of rowing exercises, suggesting a secondary match (score 0.6). The classification considers the short warm-up nature, focusing on technical precision rather than intensity or restorative aspects, and therefore excludes 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Soothing & Restorative,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits."
