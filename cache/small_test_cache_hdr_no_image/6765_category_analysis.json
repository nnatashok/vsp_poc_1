  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Bootcamp HIIT Row', where 'HIIT' and 'Row' are explicit indicators of a high-intensity interval training session performed on a rowing machine. The description mentions 'train short intervals followed by quick recovery,' typical of HIIT workouts, and specifically references navigating 'Indian Creek,' aligning with rowing. The intensity is described as 3 out of 3, confirming the workout's high intensity level, suitable for HIIT. Although 'Drive' and 'Standard' are mentioned under Workout Type, they are not standard classifications, hence the focus on HIIT. The playlist featuring dance hits and well-known tracks corresponds with high-energy HIIT sessions, reinforcing this classification. Therefore, 'HIIT' is given a score of 0.9 for its strong presence, and 'Indoor rowing' a score of 0.8 due to its clear relevance from 'Row'. Other categories like 'Mat' or 'Body weight' are excluded as no equipment-free exercises or body weight specifics are mentioned."
