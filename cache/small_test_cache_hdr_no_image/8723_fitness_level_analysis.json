Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 5 minutes and 44 seconds, categorized as a 'cool down', indicates very low energy expenditure. Effort in cool-down exercises focuses on light, gentle movements. Additionally, the max rhythm of 24 strokes per minute supports a light activity level given it is significantly below typical workout intensities. Hence, 'Light' effort difficulty is highly appropriate, with a slight consideration for 'Moderate' due to potential residual fatigue from any prior intense session.",
