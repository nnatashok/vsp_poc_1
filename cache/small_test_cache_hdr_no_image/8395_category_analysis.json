  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Core Engagement + Stretch Cool-Down,' which indicates a rowing workout with an added core focus and stretch component. The description mentions 'steadily row with Nick and Dani and then incorporate a few pauses to engage your core and stretch your hamstrings,' clearly establishing an indoor rowing workout as the primary activity with a core engagement and stretching as secondary elements. The inclusion of specific rowing terms like 'Max rhythm: 22' and 'Format: Steady' are strong indicators that reinforce the rowing focus. The term 'cool down' also suggests a lower intensity, potentially incorporating stretching. Given these factors, 'Indoor rowing' is assigned a high score of 0.8, as it is the primary component, and 'Stretching' receives a score of 0.6, reflecting its inclusion as a secondary component in the description."
