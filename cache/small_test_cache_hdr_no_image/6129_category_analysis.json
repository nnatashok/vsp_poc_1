  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly titled 'Restorative Yoga', which strongly indicates the 'Yoga' category. This is supported by the description that mentions gentle movement and time spent in poses, typical of yoga practices, especially restorative styles that focus on relaxation and stress relief. The music genre 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' aligns with a calming and meditative yoga session, enhancing relaxation. The 'On The Mat' tag suggests floor-based exercise, further supporting the 'Yoga' classification and also indicating the 'Mat' category, as yoga typically involves mat work. Although there is no specific mention of meditation practices, the restorative nature of the session and the music hint at a possible meditative component, albeit with less certainty, therefore assigning a lower score for 'Meditation'. Other categories like 'Stretching' or 'Pilates' were not chosen as the primary focus is clearly on yoga and relaxation."
