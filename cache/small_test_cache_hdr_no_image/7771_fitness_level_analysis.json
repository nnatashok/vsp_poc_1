  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout 'Steady Adventure Row' focuses on maintaining a consistent split over several intervals. The rowing technique primarily emphasized requires straightforward movements typical for beginners. However, managing pace across intervals adds minimal complexity. The 'breathe' category further suggests a relaxed, easily manageable session. However, some slight coordination in maintaining rhythm contributes to the minimal intermediate classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as a 'breathe' type with an intensity of 1 out of 3, indicating low physical demand. The 'climb' format with a 31-minute duration and moderately paced intervals suggests a light effort, with some energy expenditure from maintaining a steady pace. The playlist of upbeat but not overly intense music supports the light effort classification, with minimal hints of a higher energy output typical for moderate levels.",
