  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Structured & Disciplined,' as indicated by the term 'Interval' in the format and the focus on maintaining effort and rhythmic control ('rhythm 20 during intervals'). This suggests a methodical approach with a component of technique and control, justifying a high score of 0.8. Additionally, there is an aspect of 'Flow & Rhythm,' supported by the music-driven nature of the session with songs from genres like dance and global hits, suggesting a rhythmic component underpinning the workout. The description's reference to rhythms and teaching elements also supports integration with music and flow, which warrants a moderate score of 0.6. The mention of 'breathe' and low intensity level implies a lower energy, ruling out 'High-Energy & Intense' despite the dance music. 'Soothing & Restorative' is unlikely due to interval training, and there's no outdoor element indicating 'Outdoor & Adventure,' nor sport-specific criteria for 'Sport & Agility.'"
