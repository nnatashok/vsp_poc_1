  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.7 because it involves rowing-based activities with a focus on interval rhythm work (rhythms 26 and 28), typical for endurance and repetitive physical engagement. This aligns with the nature of 'The Meditative Grind' which is about zoning in and letting repetition take over. Supporting evidence includes the rowing intervals and the lack of an instructor, which encourages internal focus. Secondly, 'The Endorphin Wave' is relevant with a score of 0.6 due to the music choice of rock and global hits at a mid-intensity level, combined with the workout's emphasis on maintaining an elevated heart rate. The use of engaging rock music can induce a feel-good, steady build in energy, characteristic of 'The Endorphin Wave'. The workout name \"Runner's Program\" implies an emphasis on rhythm and stamina building, further supporting these vibes."
