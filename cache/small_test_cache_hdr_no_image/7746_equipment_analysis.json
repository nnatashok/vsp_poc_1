  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title and description strongly suggest that a rowing machine is necessary. The phrases 'explode with power and speed,' 'drive,' 'standard,' and 'row' are all indicative of a rowing workout, which typically requires a rowing machine. Additionally, the format is described as 'Power,' which aligns with high-intensity rowing sessions. The metadata lacks any mention of other equipment types, and the focus on rhythm and rowing-specific terminology supports a high confidence level of 0.9 that a rowing machine is essential. The advanced fitness level and high-intensity rating further imply the need for equipment capable of sustaining a rigorous workout, which is consistent with usage of a rowing machine. Therefore, the only necessary equipment for this workout is the rowing machine."
