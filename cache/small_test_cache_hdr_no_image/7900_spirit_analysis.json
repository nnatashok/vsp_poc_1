  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Pop Row' strongly embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to several factors: the title suggests a pop music-driven session, and the description specifies holding sprint paces and max pushes, which indicate high intensity. The interval format and the max intensity level of 3 out of 3 further support a high-energy classification. The inclusion of popular, upbeat songs like 'Can't Hold Us' and 'Moves Like Jagger' reinforces a fast-paced, energetic environment, making this spirit a suitable match with a score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant, supported by the rhythmic elements of pop music that drive the workout, as inferred from the playlist containing well-known pop hits that notionally facilitate flow through music-driven pacing. This spirit is assigned a score of 0.7, indicating a strong presence but secondary to the high-intensity nature.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to the lack of indicators for structure, restitution, sport-specific skills, or an outdoor setting, thereby focusing the classification on intensity and rhythm attributes."
