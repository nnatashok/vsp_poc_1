  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Core Flow' suggests a focus on continuous, smooth movements typically associated with a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, which is corroborated by the use of 'flow' in both the title and the description. The description mentions 'heat-building flow', indicating a dynamic yet cohesive pace. The recommendation of a yoga block, common in yoga or pilates sessions, also supports this spirit. Additionally, the music playlist, featuring genres such as Chill and Downtempo, and tracks like 'Be Kind' and 'Just My Imagination' suggests a soothing and relaxing atmosphere, indicating elements of a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit as well. The 'standard on-the-mat' category and a duration of approximately 21 minutes suggest a workout session designed to maintain a steady pace suitable for building core strength in a mindful setting, further underscoring both spirits. There are no indicators of high intensity, structure, or adventure, leading to the exclusion of other spirits."
