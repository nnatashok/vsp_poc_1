  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as focusing on stretching, particularly targeting the hips, legs, and ankles, which directly supports the classification under 'Stretching'. The recommendation to use yoga blocks further suggests a structured stretching routine aimed at improving flexibility, consistent with this category. The 'stretching' workout type specifically mentioned in the metadata, combined with the workout description, gives this category a very high confidence score of 0.9.\n\nThe second category, 'Mat', is assigned due to the reference to 'On The Mat' in the workout type category and the nature of stretching exercises, which are typically performed on the floor using supportive surfaces like exercise mats. This justifies a moderate score of 0.6 for 'Mat'. The music and setting (overlooking Dublin) do not directly influence these classifications but create an ambiance for a relaxing stretching session, reinforcing the primary categorization."
