  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Fix Your Posture', which suggests an emphasis on corrective exercise and alignment. The mention of 'Practice mobility' in the description indicates a focus on controlled, low-intensity movement aimed at improving posture. This aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe due to its emphasis on deep stretching and low stress, and therefore receives a strong score of 0.75, indicating a clear match.\n\nThe second relevant vibe, 'The Foundation Builder', is chosen because this workout aims to strengthen weak points such as posture and mobility, which are fundamental components of improving basic body mechanics. Given the focus on correcting and improving foundational issues, it receives a score of 0.6.\n\nThe lack of specified music genre and the use of indie and global hits imply a somewhat neutral background that does not contribute strongly to a specific emotional tone, hence no stronger match to a music-driven vibe. Overall the metadata points clearly to correction and posture improvement, supporting these vibe selections with a high confidence level of 0.75."
