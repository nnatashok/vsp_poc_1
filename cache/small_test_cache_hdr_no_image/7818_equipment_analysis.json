  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title \"Steady Fundamentals Row\" and description explicitly focus on rowing, which strongly implies that a rowing machine is central to the workout. Specific keywords such as \"row\" and \"rhythm\" further emphasize the necessity of a rowing machine for this session, thus assigning it a very high confidence level of 0.9. The workout categorization under 'breathe, standard, row' substantiates the requirement of a rowing machine as an integral part of performing this exercise. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata, suggesting the primary focus is on using the rowing machine effectively."
