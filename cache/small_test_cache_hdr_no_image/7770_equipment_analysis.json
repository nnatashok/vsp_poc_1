  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title 'Welcome to Norway Row' and the description explicitly focus on rowing, which strongly suggests that a rowing machine is necessary for this workout. The description mentions 'tackling 1-minute intervals in Nord\u00e5svannet Bay,' which aligns with rowing activities. Keywords like 'Destination,' 'intervals,' and 'Bay' further imply an indoor rowing scenario facilitated by a rowing machine, as it simulates outdoor rowing activities. The metadata also categorizes the workout as both 'Drive' and 'row,' reinforcing that the central activity involves rowing, and therefore, a rowing machine is essential. Consequently, the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high at 1.0."
