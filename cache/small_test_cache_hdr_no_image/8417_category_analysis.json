  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is titled 'Upper Body Strength with Bands', and the description states it is for strengthening the upper body using long resistance bands. This workout fits well under the 'Mat' category since it involves exercises using a resistance band, typically performed on the floor or mat, emphasizing body positioning and controlled movements. The inclusion of strength-based exercises with bands suggests 'Weight workout' as a relevant category because resistance bands serve as a form of equipment providing resistance akin to free weights or machines. The high energy, contemporary music soundtrack supports an active workout setting rather than a meditative or low-intensity environment. The combined metadata suggests a focused strength workout, placing high-weight scores on 'Mat' (0.8) due to the description and category tag, and on 'Weight workout' (0.7) due to the resistance and strength components."
