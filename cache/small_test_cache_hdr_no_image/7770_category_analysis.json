  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout classified as HIIT is based on the core structure of the exercises described as '1-minute intervals' which indicates alternating periods of high intensity and rest typical of High-Intensity Interval Training. The workout is on a rowing machine as indicated by the \"row\" tag and the mention of rowing in the title 'Welcome to Norway Row', which confirms the 'Indoor rowing' category. The presence of clear evidence leads to high confidence in these selections. The mentioned intensity level of '3 out of 3' aligns with typical high-intensity interval training, supporting the assignment of HIIT with a strong score. Other categories such as Mat or Body weight were excluded due to the explicit mention of rowing and the absence of any indication of mat work or bodyweight exercises, coupled with the focus on interval timing and the music choice enhancing a high-energy atmosphere, which is common in rowing workouts."
