  "spiritsExplanation": "The spirit of the workout is primarily 'High-Energy & Intense' because the metadata indicates that it is a short, maximum-effort challenge designed to push limits in a competitive format ('1-minute challenge for maximum meters' and 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3'). The inclusion of high-paced pop music and global hits further supports this classification, creating an energetic atmosphere. The 'Sport & Agility' spirit is also present as indicated by the competitive element ('it\u2019s you and Mike versus the production crew'), suggesting a performance-based approach that requires coordination and quick movements. The advanced fitness level requirement and 'Max rhythm: 32+' reinforce the focus on speed and agility. The absence of explicit references to nature or structured training rules out other spirits."
