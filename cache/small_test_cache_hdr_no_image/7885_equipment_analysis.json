  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Post-Row Pilates' session, indicating that it is intended to be performed after a rowing workout. This implies the usage of a rowing machine, assigning it a high confidence score of 0.7, as it is integral to the context of the workout. Additionally, the category 'On The Mat' strongly suggests that a mat is necessary. The workout's classification as 'pilates' further supports the need for a mat, as pilates typically requires one for floor exercises. Thus, the confidence score for a mat is very high, at 0.9. The metadata does not mention any other specific equipment, and given the short duration and focus on stretching and planks, no additional equipment is inferred beyond these items."
