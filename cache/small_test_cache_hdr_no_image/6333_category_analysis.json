  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Post-Row Align Yoga', explicitly indicating it is a Yoga session ('Yoga' category) designed specifically for after a rowing workout. The description further supports this by stating it focuses on moving through hips, hamstrings, and spine with an align yoga practice, confirming the selection of the 'Yoga' category with high confidence, assigned a score of 0.9 due to the specific naming and description. Additionally, the category 'On The Mat' from the metadata and the typical practice of yoga being mat-based justifies including the 'Mat' category, although secondary, with a score of 0.7. Given the explicit indicators related to yoga, other potential categories like 'Stretching' or others related to rowing were not selected as the focus is specifically on a Yoga-centric routine."
