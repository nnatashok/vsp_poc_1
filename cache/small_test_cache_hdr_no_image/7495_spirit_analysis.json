The integration of mobility and functional movements indicates a smooth flow of exercises. 'Structured & Disciplined' is also relevant with a score of 0.6, as the workout is part of a 'Runner's Program' which implies a systematic, progressive approach, and involves strength building, which requires methodical execution. 'Sport & Agility' scored 0.5, as the workout focuses on functional movement specifically for runners, pointing towards an athletic, performance-based component. Other spirits were not included due to lack of explicit recovery, high-intensity, or outdoor exploration indicators."
