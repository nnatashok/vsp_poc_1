  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Back Bends Align' and description both suggest a focus on flexibility and positions typical of yoga, which is commonly performed on a mat. The category 'On The Mat' further reinforces that a mat is essential for this workout, as it specifically mentions the workout taking place 'On The Mat.' These cues firmly indicate the central role of a mat, warranting very high confidence (0.95) that a mat is required. Other equipment is not mentioned, suggesting the workout is primarily grounded on the mat without additional props."
