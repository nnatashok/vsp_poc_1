  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Comeback Row' is centered around gradually building rhythm, with an emphasis on the instructor's personal experience and the idea of a 'comeback', suggesting a focus on consistent movement and mental engagement. The use of the term 'rhythm' explicitly supports the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, further implied by a capped rowing rhythm at 24 strokes per minute. This slow pace indicates continuity without intensity, matching a flow-focused approach. The 'Breathe' category, low intensity (1 out of 3), and beginner fitness level further reinforce a spirit aligned with gradual engagement, fitting 'Soothing & Restorative'. The playlist featuring indie and alternative artists like Bahamas and Hozier suggests a laid-back, calming atmosphere, consistent with a soothing and restorative experience. Consequently, 'Flow & Rhythm' scores 0.75, as it aligns well with rhythm-building but lacks explicit music-driven cues. 'Soothing & Restorative' scores 0.7, as it is well-supported by the pacing, music choice, and workout setup aiming for mental rejuvenation."
