  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Cool Down, standard, row', indicating a focus on rowing exercises. Additionally, terms like 'Max rhythm: 22' and the setting described as being at sunset on the Charles River suggest an association with rowing, likely mimicking an on-water experience using a rowing machine. The use of 'Steady' format further implies maintaining a continuous, rhythmic motion typical of rowing workouts. Therefore, a rowing machine is identified as essential to perform this workout, warranting a high confidence score of 0.9 since rowing is central to the workout's description and format."
