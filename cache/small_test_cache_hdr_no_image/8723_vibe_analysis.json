  "vibesExplanation": "Based on the provided metadata, the primary vibe for the workout is 'The Reboot Workout' with a strong score of 0.8. The title 'Steady Cool-Down' and the description mentioning 'steadily decrease your heart rate' strongly suggest a focus on winding down, alignment with the chill, relaxing nature of a reboot session. Additionally, the workout category 'Cool Down' corroborates this vibe. The secondary vibe 'The Endorphin Wave,' with a score of 0.6, is indicated by the use of popular, feel-good music from 'Pop low' and 'Global Hits,' which likely maintains a pleasant, elevated mood throughout the session. This workout provides light movement and steady pacing without high intensity, thus the Endorphin Wave's steady, feel-good movement slightly applies. Other potential vibes like 'The Zen Flow' could have been considered, but the upbeat music choice leans more towards a refreshing cooldown rather than meditative."
