  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Advanced HIIT Row' workout presents a strong match for 'The Warrior Workout' vibe. This is supported by the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format, the maximum intensity level of 3 out of 3, and the duration of slightly over 21 minutes which indicates a demanding session. The instruction to unleash maximum effort aligns with the 'unleash your inner beast' aspect of this vibe. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong alignment with this high-energy, intense vibe.\n\nThe 'Adrenaline Rush' vibe is selected due to the unpredictable intensity associated with HIIT and the emphasis on reaching 'high rhythms at maximum effort,' indicative of heart-racing, full-body intensity. The advanced fitness level required also suggests an element of challenge and unpredictability, earning it a score of 0.7.\n\nFinally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is relevant due to the emotionally uplifting and motivational nature of the workout, driven by a pop-heavy playlist featuring influential female artists. This playlist helps induce a feel-good, elevated energy state, thus earning it a score of 0.5. The shorter length indicates a quick yet impactful session, fitting the steady build aspect of this vibe."
