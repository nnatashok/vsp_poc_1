  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Consistency Row' has a strong focus on maintaining consistent split times during intervals, indicating a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The term 'consistent split' and 'sets of intervals' suggest a methodical approach, requiring participants to follow a specific pacing protocol. This structured element is supported by the metadata, as the workout is facilitated by an instructor (Mike) and includes a clear format. The choice of songs like 'Blaze Of Glory' and 'I Wanna Rock' adds a motivational element but doesn't suggest an intense or rhythmic flow alone. Therefore, 'Flow & Rhythm' also moderately applies due to the emphasis on rhythm ('Max rhythm: 26') and music's presence, especially given the steady pace integral to rowing. However, as the intensity level is set at 1 out of 3 and the workout type includes 'breathe,' 'High-Energy & Intense' was not chosen. Considering the beginner requirements and duration, the structure drove the principal classification."
