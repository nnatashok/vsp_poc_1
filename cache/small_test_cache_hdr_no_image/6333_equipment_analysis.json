  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Post-Row Align Yoga' and description both strongly suggest that the primary focus is on yoga, particularly designed for right after a rowing session. The title includes 'On The Mat' as a category, indicating that a mat is essential for this workout. Yoga typically requires a mat for stability and comfort during poses, especially when it involves floor exercises such as those targeting the hips, hamstrings, and spine, as mentioned in the description. Given these factors, a Mat has been assigned a very high confidence score of 0.9. No other equipment is implied or mentioned, so the workout appears to be limited to mat-based yoga exercises."
