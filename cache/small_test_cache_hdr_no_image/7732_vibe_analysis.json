  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Back Bends Align' leans towards 'The Zen Flow' vibe due to its intentional, breath-centered nature. This is evident from the workout type 'align' and the description's emphasis on starting gently and warming up for backbends. The 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' radio stations suggest a calm and unhurried atmosphere, aligning well with 'The Zen Flow'. The playlist includes mellow tracks, further reinforcing this vibe. The secondary vibe 'The Reboot Workout' is applicable due to the workout's total-body refresh quality, as inferred from the gentle start and backbend focus. The lack of high-intensity elements rules out more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout'. The chosen vibes are supported by well-matched music and workout approach, leading to high confidence in this classification, despite the absence of an explicit music genre."
