  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Meditative Grind' is assigned a score of 0.7 based on the description emphasizing a 'steady' and 'consistent' pace, which characterizes endurance rowing. The use of 'six intervals at varying durations' aligns with a repetitive, meditative workout style. The playlist featuring tracks by artists like Zedd and Sia suggests a rhythmic flow, enhancing the meditative feel.\n\n'The Endorphin Wave' scored 0.6 due to the combination of low intensity (rated 1 out of 3) and consistent rowing over 31 minutes driving steady energy without spikes, typical of an endorphin-releasing activity. The choice of upbeat, popular music genres (Dance mid, Global Hits) also suggests a feel-good, sustained energy vibe.\n\n'The Groove Session' is considered with a 0.4 score due to the dance music theme and globally popular tracks which bring a sense of fun and expressiveness to this rowing session. However, this is less dominant as the primary focus is on maintaining a consistent split, which downplays the expressiveness typically associated with Groove Sessions."
