  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Foot + Ankle Focused Yoga', which strongly indicates a yoga session. Yoga typically requires a mat for a comfortable and supportive surface, aligning with the provided category labels \"On The Mat\" and \"standard\". The description highlights movement and strength in feet and ankles, reinforcing that participants will be performing exercises on the floor, further necessitating the use of a mat. Despite no explicit mention of a mat, these elements collectively justify a very high confidence level (0.9) for requiring this equipment."
