  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit chosen is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.9 due to the workout being described as a 'flow', which implies a focus on smooth, continuous movements and coordination. The music playlist featuring songs from artists like RY X and R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL aligns with a rhythmic and emotive quality that typically supports a flow-centric workout. \n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is strongly considered as well with a score of 0.85. The use of terms like 'beginner friendly' and 'scenic Achill Island' suggests a calming and accessible session, likely aimed at relaxation and gentle movement. The chill and downtempo music further supports this interpretation, aligning with a soothing environment.\n\nFinally, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is included with a moderate score of 0.6, due mainly to the location on Achill Island. This setting provides an element of nature-based immersion, albeit not the central focus of the workout. Lack of specific outdoor challenges or exploration details keeps this spirit at a lower confidence.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the absence of intense or performance-driven elements, and 'Structured & Disciplined' was not considered due to the lack of emphasis on technical precision or methodical progression."
