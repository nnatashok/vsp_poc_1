  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This classification is evident from the workout's emphasis on stretching and recovery, focusing on body parts like hips, legs, and ankles favorable for post-run relaxation. The recommendation of yoga blocks is also indicative of a restorative approach aimed at gentle recovery. The setting, overlooking Dublin, and the fact that it is part of a 'Runner's Program,' suggests an opportunity for mental relaxation, enhancing the restorative spirit. \n\nAdditionally, there is a minor 'Flow & Rhythm' element with a score of 0.4. While the workout is primarily stretching, the playlist features dance and global hits, which can invoke a sense of rhythm and smooth movement, albeit secondary to the restorative nature.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit scores 0.3 due to the outdoor visual elements described, potentially providing a sense of reconnecting with nature in a scenic way, although the stretching focus doesn\u2019t strongly align with this category's core adventure activities."
