  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily identified as a 'Masterclass Workout' due to its focus on a Pilates session designed to strengthen specific areas (hips and core), aligning with skill-building and technique-driven elements typical of a masterclass. The session targets 'runners,' indicating a targeted, skill-focused approach. The score of 0.75 reflects strong alignment, bolstered by its structured nature and intentional focus. \n\nThe 'Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe is inferred from the playlist featuring dynamic pop and remixed tracks ('Big Energy,' 'Say So'), which suggests a beat-driven and music-infused session, albeit not its primary focus. The score of 0.6 reflects the music's potential contribution to the workout's energy and atmosphere.\n\nLastly, the 'Disciplined Grind' vibe receives a moderate score of 0.5. Pilates requires discipline and consistent focus on form, mirrored in this workout's emphasis on specific body strengthening. However, the explicit playlist and session description tilt the workout more towards rhythm and mastery rather than pure discipline-driven execution."
