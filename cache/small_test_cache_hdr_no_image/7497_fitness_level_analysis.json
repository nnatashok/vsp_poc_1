Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 10 minutes and 44 seconds, which is relatively short, suggesting a manageable energy expenditure. Combined with the pilates category, effort intensity is unlikely to be high. The description of adjusting pace suggests moderate exertion rather than intense bursts, aligning it with 'Moderate' effort difficulty. Additionally, the presence of motivating music implies a pace that keeps energy levels up without being overly taxing.",
