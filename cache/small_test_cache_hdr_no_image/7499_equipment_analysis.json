  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description explicitly mentions 'Yoga blocks recommended,' indicating a high confidence score of 0.7 for the need for blocks. This suggests they are not essential but helpful for those performing the stretches. The category 'On The Mat' strongly suggests the use of a mat for floor-based exercises, hence a very high confidence score of 0.85. The title 'Runner's Program #5' implies it is designed for those who run and now need to stretch, aligning with typical use cases for mats in stretching routines. There is no direct mention or implication of other equipment needed, and the focus on stretching supports the conclusion that only these items are relevant for this workout."
