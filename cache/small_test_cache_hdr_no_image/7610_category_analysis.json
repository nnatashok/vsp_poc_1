  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 0.9 due to explicit references in the metadata indicating it is performed on a rowing machine. Terms like 'gain big meters' and 'row' in the category, along with 'sprint pace' and 'intervals,' strongly suggest it involves a rowing ergometer. The intensity level and focus on sprint paces further reinforce this classification. 'HIIT' is assigned a score of 0.6 because the workout involves sprint pace and maximum effort segments, typical of high-intensity interval training, even though it's primarily labeled as rowing. The interval format supports the HIIT categorization. The intensity described as 'level 3 out of 3' aligns with a high-level, intense workout, common to HIIT routines. Other categories like 'Running' or 'Mat' do not apply since the activity is clearly described in the context of rowing."
