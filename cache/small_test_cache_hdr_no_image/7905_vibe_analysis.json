  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Bodyweight Strength' focuses on core engagement and stability building, which indicates a somewhat intense and focused session. The setting is described as 'overlooking the lush mountains of Norway,' adding an element of serenity and connection with nature. However, the music genre provides a stronger clue to the workout's vibe. The playlist includes dance and global hits, featuring artists like Pitbull and Kygo, suggesting a vibrant and beat-driven experience. The prominent use of remixes and energetic tracks supports a classification into 'The Groove Session' vibe, capturing fun and expressive movement adapted to a full-body engagement workout. This vibe is assigned a score of 0.7 due to the balance of strength training with danceable music. Additionally, 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' is a suitable secondary vibe, considering the strong, fluid movements likely choreographed to the playlist's beats, emphasizing rhythmic power, hence the score of 0.6. The absence of a specified music genre creates moderate confidence in the selected vibes, as alignment is inferred from the playlist."
