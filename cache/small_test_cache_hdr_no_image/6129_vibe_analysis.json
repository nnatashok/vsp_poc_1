  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Restorative Yoga' strongly aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, scoring 0.8, due to its focus on gentle movement and spending time in each pose, which is emphasized in the description. The calming environment and the 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' radio stations further reinforce a grounding and intentional practice typical of 'Zen Flow.'\n\nIt also fits 'The Reboot Workout' vibe with a score of 0.7, as it aims to deeply stretch and refresh the body, indicated by the restorative nature of the session and its classification as 'restore.' The playlist, featuring relaxed and low-tempo music, supports this vibe of a low stress, total-body refresh workout.\n\nLastly, 'The Deep Recharge' is also a relevant vibe, though weaker at 0.5, as the workout offers a nervous system reset through restorative yoga. However, the inclusion of popular and recognizable songs like 'No Scrubs' and 'Talk' introduces mild elements of engagement not typically predominant in ultra-gentle sessions which affects its stronger classification as a 'Deep Recharge' workout."
