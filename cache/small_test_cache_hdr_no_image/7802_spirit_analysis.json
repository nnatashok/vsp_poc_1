  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title, 'Racing Rock Row,' along with the description, suggests an energetic atmosphere driven by a rock playlist and high rhythm numbers. The presence of a high rhythm max of 34 and an interval format indicates an intense and fast-paced session, directly aligning with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The high intensity level of 3 out of 3 further supports a strong match for this spirit, leading to a score of 0.9. Additionally, the description's mention of 'high rhythm numbers' and the music choice emphasize the role of music-driven pacing, which is a hallmark of the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. Classic rock tracks like 'I Wanna Rock' and 'Cum On Feel The Noize' suggest a continuous movement pattern that complements the workout's rhythm, justifying a score of 0.7 for this spirit. Other potential spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the lack of methodical or relaxation-focused elements. Overall, explicit indicators provide high confidence in the classification of these spirits."
