  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout focuses on rowing intervals with a shift in rhythm, which indicates some level of coordination required to maintain proper form at varying speeds. The max rhythm of 28 suggests a moderate complexity, aligning more with an Intermediate technique due to rhythm shifts and the requirement to maintain form at higher strokes per minute. The description and intensity level suggest that while some skill is needed, it does not reach advanced complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 11 minutes and 33 seconds with a workout intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggests moderate physical demand. The format as 'Climb' with intervals increasing in rhythm contributes to the exertion level, making it moderately challenging for beginners but manageable for intermediates. Thus, the effort is placed between Moderate and Challenging due to the need to handle increased rhythm and the overall intensity rating stated.",
