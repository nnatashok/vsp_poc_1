  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata explicitly mentions using a \"foam roller,\" which is directly stated in the workout description as necessary for stretching major muscles in the back. This specificity yields a very high confidence score of 0.9 for the foam roller being required. Additionally, the category \"On The Mat,standard,on-the-mat\" strongly implies the use of a mat for this stretching session, though it's not explicitly mentioned in the description. Since the workout involves floor work commonly done on a mat, this suggests a high likelihood of a mat being needed, resulting in a confidence score of 0.7. No other equipment is indicated by the metadata or implied by the workout type or location."
