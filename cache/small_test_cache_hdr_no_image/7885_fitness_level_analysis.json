  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session's duration is short at 5 minutes and 42 seconds, with low-intensity exercises like stretching and planking, which suggest low energy expenditure. Post-row classification and the chill music genre also imply a focus on relaxation, aligning with 'Light' effort. The presence of planks introduces a small element of effort, possibly elevating to 'Moderate' for some deconditioned users, explaining the scores of Light (0.8) and Moderate (0.2).",
