  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout title 'Racing Rock Row' and description provide clear indicators that this is an Indoor Rowing session. The description highlights a high rhythm, which suggests that rowing is the central activity. Additionally, terms like 'Max rhythm', 'Intervals', and 'Drive' further reinforce that this workout is centered around high-intensity rowing exercises typical of Indoor Rowing, resulting in a perfect score of 1 for this category. The use of the word 'Intervals' and a high-intensity level of 3 out of 3 strongly implies High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which is why it is also assigned but with a slightly lower score of 0.7 due to the primary focus on rowing. The playlist consisting of classic rock songs matches the high-energy nature of the workout, which aligns with both Indoor Rowing and HIIT activities. Other categories were excluded due to a lack of direct evidence or indicators supporting their inclusion."
