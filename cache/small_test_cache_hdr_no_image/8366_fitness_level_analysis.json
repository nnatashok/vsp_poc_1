  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'Drive' indicates a focus on intensity and form, suggesting advanced skill requirements typical of high coordination movements. The description's emphasis on 'high rhythms' and 'maximum meters' indicates a need for practiced technique, supporting an advanced classification. Due to the specified intensity and technical demands, there's also a marginal alignment with expert level.",
