  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence score of 0.9. The indications for this classification include references to 'gently' warming up and the focus on backbends, which are typically associated with flexibility and relaxation. Additionally, the music played during the workout, described as Chill and Downtempo, further supports a restorative and calming atmosphere. The term 'align' in the title and category also implies a focus on body positioning and alignment, often emphasized in restorative practices. \n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a moderate confidence score of 0.6. This is inferred from the music selection, which includes remixes and rhythmically engaging tracks, suggesting a dance or flow aspect to the workout that enhances the mind-body connection and matches movements to musical beats. \n\n'High-Energy & Intense' and other spirits were excluded due to the lack of explicit high-intensity cues or competitive, sports-specific elements in the metadata."
