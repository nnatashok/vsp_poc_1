  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Upper Body Strength with Bands' is primarily focused on strength training using a resistance band. This points towards 'The Foundation Builder' vibe due to its emphasis on strengthening and rebuilding basics, which is common in workouts that use resistance bands for targeted muscle improvement. The 0.75 score reflects a strong alignment with this vibe because of the focus on core strength, foundational exercises, and its suitability for all fitness levels (Beginner to Advanced). \n\n'Progression Quest' is also suitable (0.65 score) as this workout involves methodical strength progression, evident from the universal fitness level requirement and the use of resistance bands which often support incremental strength improvements over time.\n\nThe playlist, featuring pop and global hits, introduces a lighter, enjoyable atmosphere suggestive of 'The Groove Session' vibe. The choice of energetic and popular tracks lends a fun, rhythmic element to the routine, hence its inclusion with a 0.45 score. This suggests some alignment with this vibe but is secondary to the primary focus on strength and progression."
