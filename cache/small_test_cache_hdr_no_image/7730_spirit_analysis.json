  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled '80s Intervals Row', with its focus on interval training and an 'intensity level of 2 out of 3', strongly suggests the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. This classification is supported by the description 'turn up the volume and intensity' and the inclusion of the 'Sweat' category, which emphasizes maximum effort and heart-pumping energy, hence a score of 0.75.\n\nThe playlist, featuring rhythmic and upbeat hits from the 80s like 'Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go' and 'I'm So Excited', complements the structured intervals with a flow that enhances coordination and movement, suggesting a 'Flow & Rhythm' aspect. The use of continuous movement through music-driven pacing justifies this spirit choice, though at a slightly lower score of 0.65 due to the primary focus on intensity.\n\nOther spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' were considered but less fit as there's not enough emphasis on technical precision or methodical protocols beyond the interval format. The absence of outdoor or restorative elements rules out those spirits."
