  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is primarily Light, as indicated by the short duration (5 minutes 44 seconds) and the format being a warm-up. This suggests the workout is designed to elevate the heart rate slightly and prepare the body for more demanding exercise, rather than being a workout with high energy expenditure. The Moderate score inclusion is due to the 'Climb' format which might involve brief, minor increases in intensity, aligning moderately with some effort, but primarily it remains a Light activity.",
