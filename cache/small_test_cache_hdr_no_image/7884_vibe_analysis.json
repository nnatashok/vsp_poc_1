  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Whole Body Stretch', is centered around stretching the hips, hamstrings, back, and glutes, indicating a focus on flexibility and relaxation, which aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe. The duration of about 15 minutes and the emphasis on scenery of Norway suggest a tranquil, refreshing experience, typical of this vibe. The music playlist, which includes Kygo remixes and global hits, gives an uplifting background, aligning well with 'The Nature Flow' vibe due to the outdoor, scenic element described, although not a perfect match since stretching isn't typically core to Nature Flow experiences which are more dynamic. Hence, these vibes were selected, with 'Reboot' scoring slightly higher due to the direct focus on deep, rejuvenating stretches, while the scenic element and music support a milder alignment with 'Nature Flow'. The overall confidence in this classification is high due to clear indicators in the metadata."
