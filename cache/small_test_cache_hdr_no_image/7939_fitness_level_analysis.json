  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The Pyramid Quiz Row workout features basic rowing which is often considered beginner-friendly in terms of technique difficulty. The format 'Pyramid' may involve variations in speed, specifically max rhythm of 26, but this typically does not advance the complexity beyond beginner technical capabilities. The metadata indicates a low intensity level of 1 out of 3 and categorizes the workout as 'breathe', which aligns with exercises requiring simple movement execution. Thus, the workout primarily aligns with Beginner level complexity, with a slight overlap into Intermediate due to rhythmic pacing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout's duration of 11 minutes and 15 seconds, coupled with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, the effort difficulty is likely to be Light. The 'breathe' classification suggests a lower energy expenditure, suitable for less fit users. The rhythmic elements might slightly increase energy demands which gives some credit to Moderate, but the overall profile still corresponds best with a Light level difficulty.",
