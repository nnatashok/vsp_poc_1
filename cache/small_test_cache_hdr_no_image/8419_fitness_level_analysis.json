  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is short (5 minutes 47 seconds), and since it is a warm-up focused on legs-only rowing, the energy expenditure is minimal. Therefore, it's classified primarily as 'Light' effort (score 0.8). The repetitive nature of rowing can occasionally provide a mild cardiovascular challenge, which adds a moderate effort level possibility (score 0.4).",
