  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Welcome to Norway Flow' with a description focusing on a 'core-focused flow' suggests a mat-based exercise involving flowing movements. The term 'flow' is commonly associated with Yoga, specifically styles like Vinyasa or Flow Yoga, which matches the serene and core-focused theme. The music genre, featuring chill and downtempo tracks, supports a relaxed and mindful workout experience. The metadata classifies it under 'On The Mat,' leading to a high likelihood of it being a mat workout primarily, hence a score of 0.7 for 'Mat.' 'Yoga' is inferred as another strong possibility in line with the 'flow' terminology, meriting a score of 0.6. 'Stretching' is included with a score of 0.4 due to possible elements of flexibility work in this serene and core-focused setup, although it's less emphasized compared to the other two categories. The workout type 'flow' distinguishes it from purely strength or cardio-based activities, further narrowing down the categories."
