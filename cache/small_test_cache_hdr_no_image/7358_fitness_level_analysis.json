  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Consistent Effort Row' focusing on maintaining rhythms between 20 to 24. Rowing in these rhythm ranges generally requires basic to moderate technique understanding. Given that the max rhythm is 24 and the interval format is used, this presents a small increase in complexity beyond pure beginner workouts but remains approachable. The 'breathe' category suggests focus on steadiness rather than technique complexity, supporting a strong beginner classification with slight intermediate consideration.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 21 minutes and 18 seconds, with an intensity level marked as 1 out of 3, indicating a low physical demand. The format's focus on maintaining consistent effort with rhythm shifts suggests effort just above light, particularly for deconditioned beginners. Hence, it primarily aligns with a Light effort difficulty, with some elements potentially requiring Moderate effort from completely unfit users during intervals.",
