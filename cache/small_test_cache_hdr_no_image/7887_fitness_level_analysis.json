  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for 'Climbing Intervals Row' is primarily Beginner with some Intermediate aspects. Rowing is a basic movement that beginner users can usually handle with basic training. The interval format requires the user to adjust intensity and rhythm, which introduces a moderate level of coordination, aligning with Intermediate. However, the overall movement complexity remains relatively simple, primarily focusing on rhythm and timing adjustments.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty classification is Moderate with some elements of Challenging. With a duration of over 30 minutes and an interval format, there is an inherent increase in energy expenditure. The 'sweat' workout type also suggests a higher intensity, further supported by the workout intensity level being 2 out of 3. The variance in intensity during intervals adds a challenging aspect, but overall it remains more accessible to those at lower fitness levels.",
