  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 21 minutes for a 'flow' session suggests a gentle, sustained sequence which aligns with light effort difficulty, as the focus is on opening the hips and mindfulness rather than high-intensity exertion. The chill, downtempo music further suggests a more relaxing session, although some challenge could arise for total beginners, justifying a lower moderate score as well.",
