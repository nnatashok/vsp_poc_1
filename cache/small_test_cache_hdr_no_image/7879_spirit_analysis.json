  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.9 due to its emphasis on cooling down and preparing for future sessions, indicative of a focus on recovery and relaxation. Key terms like 'Recovery Cool-Down', 'cooling your body down', and 'reinforcing technique' suggest a gentle and restorative nature. The choice of 'cool down' as the workout type further strengthens this classification. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant with a score of 0.6, as the playlist features songs known for their musical flow and steady rhythm, such as 'Latch' and 'Love Story', which may help in creating a continuous and rhythmic cool-down experience despite the lack of specific rhythmic indicators in the format. The music's genres like 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' suggest a moderate, consistent rhythm, which supports this secondary spirit classification."
