  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata strongly indicates that a rowing machine is required for this workout. Firstly, the workout is categorized under 'row', which directly implies the need for rowing equipment. The description mentions 'climbing interval' and a 'power' format, both of which are consistent with high-intensity rowing sessions on a rowing machine. Furthermore, the use of terminology like 'drive' in the workout type reinforces the central role of a rowing machine, as 'drive' is a term commonly used to describe the action phase in rowing. The high intensity level (3 out of 3) supports the requirement of a rowing machine to achieve the intended workout format and goals. Therefore, the confidence level for the rowing machine is very high at 1.0, as it is explicitly and centrally inherent to the workout."
