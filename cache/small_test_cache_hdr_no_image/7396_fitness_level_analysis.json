  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts for 15 minutes and 44 seconds, which is a short duration, suggesting a lower physical demand. The description labels it as a beginner strength workout, implying a focus on introducing strength movements at a gentle pace. The short duration and the use of terms like 'approachable' suggest low energy expenditure. However, since it is whole-body, there may be moderate exertion required, explaining the presence of some moderate-level alignment.",
