  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Post-Row Pilates,' suggests a focus on recovery and gentle movement following a rowing session. The description emphasizes hip stretching and planks, aligning with a slow, deliberate pace typical of pilates. It suits 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which involves deep stretch and low stress, seen in the post-row context designed to refresh and recover. The music genre, which includes songs by Lorde and Taylor Swift, combined with radio stations labeled Chill and Downtempo, reinforces a calm and soothing environment consistent with 'The Zen Flow.' The short duration minimizes intensity, supporting a more relaxing experience. The absence of intense or competitive elements narrows the potential vibe options away from anything high-energy or endurance-based, increasing confidence in these selections. Uncertainty exists due to lack of explicit intensity or emotional descriptors in the metadata, indicating a moderate confidence level."
