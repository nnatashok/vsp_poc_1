  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Steady State Row', suggests a consistent and rhythmical exercise due to 'steady state' and pace instructions of 22 and 24, which aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. This is further supported by the playlist featuring pop hits with evident beats, promoting rhythm. Hence, this spirit was given a high score of 0.75.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' aspect scores 0.5 due to the terminology 'breathe' and 'steady', and the workout's low intensity level (1 out of 3), indicating a calm, restorative tone rather than high-energy exertion.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is complemented by 'Structured & Disciplined' because the workout follows specific rhythms (22 and 24 strokes per minute), indicating some structured protocol, although not rigorously intense, which leads to a moderate score of 0.45.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded, as the intensity level is explicitly stated as 1 out of 3. Similarly, the absence of outdoor elements rules out 'Outdoor & Adventure'."
