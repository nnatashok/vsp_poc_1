The final 1-minute all-out effort suggests very high exertion. With an intensity rating of '3 out of 3' and categorized as a 'drive' standard, the workout demands significant effort, suggesting a challenging to extreme level of energy expenditure. Therefore, Challenging fits well, with partial alignment to Extreme.",
