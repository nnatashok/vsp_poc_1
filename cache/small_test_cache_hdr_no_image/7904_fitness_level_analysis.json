  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is identified as a 'row' session with a 'breathe' format under the category 'Breathe,standard,row', indicating a focus on maintaining a smooth and steady rowing rhythm at a maximum cadence of 24 strokes per minute. Given that the user fitness level requirement is 'Beginner', the coordination required is minimal, aligning with simple, repetitive rowing strokes. The rowing technique, while requiring some consistency, is straightforward and lacks complexity, evident by the 'Beginner' fitness level prerequisite and the succinct duration of just over 11 minutes.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 11 minutes and 14 seconds, classified at an intensity level of 1 out of 3, suggesting it is not physically taxing. 'Step by Step Row' under a 'breathe' type further implies a session focused on rhythmic, controlled exertion rather than intensive energy expenditure. Although the row session aims to elevate rhythm and intensity moderately, the climb format suggests gradual exertion increases without significant stress. Combined with the upbeat indie and global hits music, the effort aligns slightly with 'Moderate', but fits 'Light' more closely due to the short duration and the indicated low-intensity level.",
