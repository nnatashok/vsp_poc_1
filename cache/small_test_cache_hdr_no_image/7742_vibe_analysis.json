  "vibesExplanation": "The workout features a 'Climb at altitude,' suggesting a focused, rhythmic progression, aligning well with both 'The Groove Session' and 'The Endorphin Wave.' The use of a rock playlist featuring classic rock hits like '(Don't Fear) The Reaper' and 'I Wanna Rock' implies a fun, rhythmic element, which is indicative of 'The Groove Session.' The workout's setting on Lake Tahoe during a rowing session gives it an enjoyable, scenic vibe, enhancing the endorphin-driven experience of 'The Endorphin Wave.' The rock playlist, combined with the format and pacing, suggests a music-infused workout environment similar to 'The Nightclub Workout,' though the lack of direct dance focus warrants a lower confidence score for this vibe. The workout intensity level is mid-range, fitting a vibe that is energetic but not overly intense, affirming the selections."
