  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout primarily involves maintaining a split rowing rhythm, which suggests a focus on controlled, repetitive movement rather than complex techniques. The use of intervals might slightly elevate the complexity to intermediate, but the metadata indicates a 'Breathe' focus which aligns with low complexity. No major coordination or technical skills are needed, supporting a beginner classification with some intermediate elements due to rhythm changes.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of just under 17 minutes and an intensity level marked as 1 out of 3, the workout is designed to be manageable even for less conditioned users. Although interval work can increase intensity, the goal of controlling effort and maintaining certain rhythms indicates a lighter focus. Therefore, the effort difficulty is primarily 'Light', with some 'Moderate' elements due to the incorporation of interval training.",
