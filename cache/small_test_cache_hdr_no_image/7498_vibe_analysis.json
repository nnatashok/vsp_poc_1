  "vibesExplanation": "The vibes selected for this workout are 'The Meditative Grind' and 'The Endorphin Wave.' The first vibe, 'The Meditative Grind,' is supported by the workout's focus on building an aerobic base, described with '3' intervals at low rhythms,' and the emphasis on breath control ('Workout Type: breathe'). These elements suggest a rhythmic and repetitive pattern typical of endurance rowing. The workout's steady pace, long duration (21 minutes), and low intensity level (1 out of 3) further justify this vibe. The high score of 0.9 reflects the strong alignment with this workout style.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is chosen as a secondary vibe due to the playlist features upbeat tracks like 'Shivers,' 'Wake Me Up,' and 'Renegades,' which can provide a feel-good, steady energy build, enhancing endurance rowing efforts. The influence of Dance and Global Hits radio stations aligns with the upbeat and positive energy typical of this vibe. The score of 0.7 indicates a strong, but not primary, match for this vibe. These observations are consistent with the workout's goals and music selection, while excluding more intense or competitive vibes due to its low intensity and beginner focus."
