  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout metadata strongly suggests this is an Indoor Rowing session due to the emphasis on rowing with terms like 'row,' 'Sweat intensity,' and 'intervals.' The structure of the workout is indicative of rowing, involving a warm-up, a high-intensity phase ('Sweat intensity'), and a cool down, where 'row' is explicitly highlighted as a category. The duration of 31 minutes with intervals corresponds to a focused indoor rowing workout. The 'sweat' workout type and the mention of 'sweat intensity' imply moderate to high intensity, compatible with High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) principles, as intervals are a key component of HIIT. Therefore, a secondary classification of HIIT is appropriate, albeit with slightly less certainty than Indoor Rowing as the primary category. Other categories like Yoga, Stretching, or Mat exercises are clearly not applicable given the structured and equipment-based nature of this workout. Thus, Indoor Rowing is scored at 0.9 due to the clear indicators, and HIIT is scored at 0.7 given the less explicit but still strong evidence."
