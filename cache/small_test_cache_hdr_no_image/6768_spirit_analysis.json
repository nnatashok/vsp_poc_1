  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout focuses on 'Essential Stretches for Your Back,' which indicates a gentle and healing approach, aligning with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The use of a 'foam roller' to 'stretch major muscles in your back' suggests a focus on recovery, relaxation, and stress reduction, further supporting the choice of the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a high score of 0.9. \n\nThe music and playlist include 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' with tracks like 'Jubel' by Klingande, which are upbeat and rhythmically engaging. However, these tracks in the context of a stretching session may contribute to a very mild essence of 'Flow & Rhythm,' justifying a lower score of 0.3 as there is limited evidence from the session's purpose and content to support a strong role for this spirit. Overall, 'Soothing & Restorative' is the dominant spirit due to the nature of the activities involved. No indicators were found for high-intensity, structured training, sports specificity, or significant outdoor elements, leading to their exclusion."
