  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Runner's Program #7 of 9' hints at a cross-training program for runners, possibly incorporating rowing as an alternative or supplementary workout. The use of phrases like 'rev your engine' and 'eight 1-minute intervals' further suggest a high-intensity workout, typical of rowing machine sessions. The term 'row' in the Category field strongly indicates that a rowing machine is essential for this workout. Given the interval format and the workout type being listed as 'drive' and 'standard,row', it reinforces the idea that a rowing machine is central to completing this workout, justifying a high confidence score of 0.8."
