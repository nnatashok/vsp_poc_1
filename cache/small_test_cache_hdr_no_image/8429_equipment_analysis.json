  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Racing Mindset Row' and the description mentioning 'bolt down the Charles River' strongly indicate that this is a rowing-focused workout. Additionally, the tags and categories, specifically 'row', further suggest that a rowing machine is required. The emphasis on the Charles River implies a virtual rowing experience, typically conducted on a rowing machine. Thus, with these factors in mind, there is very high confidence (0.9) that a rowing machine is essential to perform this workout effectively. No other equipment is suggested or implied by the metadata."
