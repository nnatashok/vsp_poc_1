  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Fix Your Posture' suggests a focus on alignment and mobility, which aligns closely with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The description mentions 'Practice mobility' and 'fix your posture for everyday life,' indicating a gentle, repair-oriented approach suitable for recovery and stress reduction, justifying a strong score of 0.8 for 'Soothing & Restorative'. The short duration (10 minutes and 47 seconds) further supports a brisk, manageable routine rather than an intense session. Meanwhile, the presence of music from the 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits' radio stations may encourage a rhythmic component to movements, suggesting a potential 'Flow & Rhythm' element, though this is less explicit, hence the moderate score of 0.4. There is not a strong indication of high-energy intensity, strict discipline, or sports-specific agility, ruling out those spirits from the scoring."
