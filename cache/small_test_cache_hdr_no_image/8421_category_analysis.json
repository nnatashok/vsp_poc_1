  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Core Flow' and described as 'heat-building flow' which strongly suggests a Yoga-based practice, specifically Vinyasa or Power Yoga, known for its focus on flowing sequences. The recommendation of a yoga block further supports this category, as yoga props are commonly used in such workouts. Thus, 'Yoga' is assigned with a high confidence score of 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, the workout is part of the 'On The Mat' category and described as 'on-the-mat' which aligns with floor exercises, further indicating that the workout is primarily performed on a mat without significant additional equipment use, justifying the inclusion of the 'Mat' category with a score of 0.7.\n\nThe music choice, with an emphasis on 'Chill', 'Cool/Downtempo' genres, fits the style of a controlled flow similar to yoga routines. Therefore, other categories such as 'Pilates' or 'Stretching' are excluded as they don't match the 'flow' terminology and focus on core.\n\nWith these considerations, the analysis provides a high confidence level at 0.9 for the selected categories."
