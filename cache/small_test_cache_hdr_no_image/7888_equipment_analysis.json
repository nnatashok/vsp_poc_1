  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Power Flow', is described as a 'flow' type exercise, with explicit mention of the 'On The Mat' category, indicating that a Mat is required with very high confidence (1.0). Yoga practice typically occurs on a mat, and this is corroborated by the category description.\n\nThe description mentions 'Yoga blocks optional', which suggests blocks could be used but are not essential. This assigns a low confidence level (0.3) for the blocks as they are optional and not crucial to performing the main elements of the workout.\n\nNo other equipment is mentioned in the metadata, and the workout type implies it is primarily focused on bodyweight exercises, typical of a yoga flow."
