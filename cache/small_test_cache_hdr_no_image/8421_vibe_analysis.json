  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Flow' primarily exhibits characteristics aligned with 'The Zen Flow' vibe at a score of 0.75. This is due to its description as a 'heat-building flow' which suggests a grounding and intentional yoga practice. The use of a yoga block and the categorization under 'On The Mat' further support a slow yet deliberate movement style typical of a yoga flow. This is enhanced by the playlist featuring chill and downtempo tracks, which align with a calming, breath-centered experience.\n\nAdditionally, the 'The Groove Session' vibe is present with a score of 0.5, indicated by the fun and rhythmic potential brought by the playlist's mix of contemporary, feel-good tracks from artists like Lorde and The Temptations. These songs suggest a more fluid and expressive side to the workout, albeit secondary to its primary zen nature. The classification leans towards moderate confidence at 0.75 due to the balanced indicators in both flow and groove elements, without explicit direction towards a high-energy or intense workout."
