  "spiritsExplanation": "The title 'Feel the Rhythm Cool-Down' and description emphasizing rowing at specific rhythms along with closed-eye rowing strongly suggest the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The words 'Feel the Rhythm' directly indicate a focus on rhythm and coordination, justifying a high score of 0.9 for this spirit. The description's mention of a 'cool down' and interval of rhythms 22 and 24 also imply a soothing, restorative orientation instead of high intensity, aligning with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The cool down focus lowers intensity stress, giving it a score of 0.7. The absence of explicit intensity or competitive elements rules out 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' spirits. The music's diverse genre with songs conducive to rhythmic rowing supports these classifications, though song specifics imply potential energy that complements rhythm more than rest."
