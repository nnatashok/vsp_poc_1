  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Climbing Intervals Row' predominantly exhibits the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the emphasis on shifting up in rhythm each minute, as noted in the description. This suggests a strong focus on coordinating movement with musical tempo, justifying a high score of 0.75. The inclusion of upbeat Latin and Global Hits further supports this spirit, as these music styles often enhance rhythmic flow.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is suggested by the format 'Climb' and the workout type labeled as 'sweat,' indicating a demanding session focused on elevating heart rate and exertion, thus earning a score of 0.65. The choice of lively and popular tracks likely contributes to maintaining a high energy level throughout the workout.\n\nA 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is evident due to the interval-based format and the technical focus mentioned in the description. This structured progression through rhythm levels implies methodical training, warranting a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nThe use of terms like 'technique' and 'intermediate level requirement' provide further evidence for both rhythmic flow and structured discipline, excluding potential spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to their irrelevance to the workout's format and environment."
