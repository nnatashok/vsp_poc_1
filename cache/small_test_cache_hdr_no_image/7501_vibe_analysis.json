  "vibesExplanation": "The workout \"Runner's Program #7 of 9\" is an interval-based row designed for advanced users, as indicated by the user fitness level requirement being 'Advanced'. The format is interval with a high-intensity level of 3 out of 3, suggesting a vigorous session aimed at complementing a run. This closely aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave' because it features steady, elevated energy through repeated efforts, and the classic rock music playlist\u2014featuring tracks like 'Born to be Wild'\u2014supports a feel-good, invigorating atmosphere. The competitive elements of interval training, combined with the lack of an instructor and the focus on timed efforts ('eight 1-minute intervals'), align well with 'The Competitor' vibe, suggesting a gamified, self-driven aspect to the workout. The absence of an explicit leaderboard or gamified element keeps the score slightly lower yet significant for this vibe. The classic rock and global hits playlist further enhances an energetic and motivating environment, filling both vibes well. Overall, the confidence is high due to the strong match of the workout's structure and musical choices with these vibes."
