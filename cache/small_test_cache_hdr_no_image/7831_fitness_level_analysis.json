  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves cardio intervals in a rowing format, which are simple to execute and primarily depend on maintaining a rhythm. Given the absence of any complex movement patterns or requirement for advanced body coordination, these exercises are aligned with Beginner to Intermediate technique difficulty. The use of the term 'intervals shifting in rhythm' suggests a manageable level of coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'sweat' category with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicating a moderately demanding session. Although the duration is relatively short at 11 minutes, the 'Cardio Intervals Row' with a max rhythm of 28 implies a moderately challenging cardio session, resulting in increased heart rate and calorie burn. Therefore, it fits well within the Moderate category with some alignment to Challenging due to its sweat focus and interval nature.",
