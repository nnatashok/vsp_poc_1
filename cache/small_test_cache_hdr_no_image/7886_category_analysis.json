  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Rage Row,' strongly suggests a rowing-based workout due to the inclusion of 'row' in both the title and tags like 'row.' The description states it is a 'high-intensity session with 60-second intervals,' which matches the characteristics of a HIIT workout. Further, the metadata explicitly categorizes it as a 'drive' and 'standard row,' aligning with 'Indoor rowing.' The workout intensity level is listed as '3 out of 3,' affirming the high-intensity nature, and the music playlist supports an energetic, rhythm-driven atmosphere typical in HIIT sessions. Given these explicit indicators, there is very high confidence in classifying this workout as both 'HIIT' (score: 0.9) and 'Indoor rowing' (score: 0.8). The detailed description and relevant keywords provide a strong basis for these categorizations."
