  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified predominantly as 'Structured & Disciplined' due to the emphasis on 'endurance through a series of intervals' and the well-structured format of fixed duration intervals. This creates a methodical approach to training endurance, typical of this spirit, earning a high score of 0.8. The playlist featuring classic rock supports a rhythmic, steady pace, which may help maintain flow and coordination, hence the 'Flow & Rhythm' classification with a 0.7 score. While the intensity is relatively low ('1 out of 3'), the focus on breathing and a steady rhythm aligns well with continuous, smooth energy, further supporting this classification. The 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit was considered but not assigned due to the beginner-friendly level and low intensity. The 'Soothing & Restorative', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits were excluded as the workout does not focus on relaxation, sports-specific skills, or an outdoor setting."
