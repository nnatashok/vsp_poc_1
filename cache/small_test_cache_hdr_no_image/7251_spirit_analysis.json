  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the structured four rounds of bodyweight exercises, suggesting a smooth, continuous flow emphasizing coordination. The music playlist, with dance and global hits, reinforces the rhythmic nature, providing a music-driven pacing that resonates with this spirit. This is assigned a score of 0.6 as it clearly matches the rhythmic and coordinated element but lacks explicit mind-body connection emphasis. \n\nAdditionally, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is considered due to the workout's setting in Seville, Spain, highlighting an outdoor component. Although the environment itself is urban rather than nature-focused, the mention of being outdoors and the location injects an element of exploration, warranting a score of 0.5. This reflects a moderate match, as the workout isn't primarily adventure-themed, but the setting adds a relevant dimension.\n\nThe intensity is not exceptionally high to fully encompass 'High-Energy & Intense,' and the focus on standard bodyweight exercises excludes 'Sport & Agility.' Given these considerations, the main spirits are identified with moderate to high confidence."
