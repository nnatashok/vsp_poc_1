  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is moderate, at just over 20 minutes, indicating a manageable effort level. The mention of strength-building exercises suggests slightly higher demands than pure mobility work, placing it at the higher end of Light (score: 0.7) with a possibility of touching Moderate (score: 0.3) due to the light aerobic component implied by the Dance and Global Hits playlist, though energy expenditure is not extremely high.",
