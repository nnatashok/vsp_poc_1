  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title 'Rhythm 30 HIIT Row' and the detailed workout description make it clear that a rowing machine is required for this workout. The term 'Row' specifically indicates the use of a rowing machine, as the workout involves driving with maximum pressure on the footboards, a component specific to rowing machines. The description emphasizes intervals at rhythm 30, which suggests adjustments on a rowing machine to match the required tempo. The high intensity level and classification under categories like 'drive' and 'row' strongly imply the centrality of a rowing machine. Thus, with a very high confidence score of 0.9, I conclude that a rowing machine is essential for this workout."
