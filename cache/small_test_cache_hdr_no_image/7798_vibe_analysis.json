  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Running Up the Hill Row' is characterized by a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format and is inspired by the energetic series 'Stranger Things', suggesting a dynamic and intense vibe. This strongly aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' due to its sweat-dripping, heart-pounding qualities, as indicated by the intensity level of 3 out of 3 and the requirement for advanced fitness levels. The incorporation of HIIT further supports this vibe with a score of 0.9 for its intense demands.\n\nThe reference to 'Running Up That Hill', a powerful and driving song, along with other energetic tracks from the 80\u2019s and global hits, contributes to 'The Firestarter' vibe, denoting a fast-paced and explosive session, especially given the shorter duration of 16:29, thus scoring 0.7.\n\nLastly, 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe is considered because the unpredictability of intervals and high energy music potentially create unpredictable challenges, meriting a score of 0.5. Other vibes like 'The Competitor' and 'The Endorphin Wave' were considered but not chosen due to lack of competitive elements and the shorter format that doesn't promote a steady build."
