  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves rowing, which is generally a low-impact activity that requires some coordination but is not overly complex. The 'Rhythm' up to 28 and 'sprinting pace' suggest a faster cadence, which may demand more technique than basic rowing, aligning with a Beginner to Intermediate difficulty. The Intermediate requirement fits the technique level, given increased pace demands some competence in form maintenance. The presence of intervals and sweat session categorization hints at slightly increased complexity, but not enough to push beyond Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of over 21 minutes and a high max rhythm of 28, this session stands to be moderately demanding. The 'sweat' workout type and categorized intensity level 2 out of 3 indicate a substantial energy expenditure is required, exacerbated by 'sprinting pace' and interval format. Intervals generally suggest higher effort levels due to the alternating high and low intensity phases, pushing it towards moderate but not quite into challenging for a less fit user base.",
