  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Consistent Effort Row' and the description mentioning intervals from rhythms 20 to 24 strongly indicate the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the category explicitly includes 'row', further confirming that the workout revolves around rowing. Given this information, there is very high confidence (confidence score of 1.0) that a rowing machine is required to perform this workout effectively. Other equipment is not mentioned, suggesting that the focus is solely on rowing."
