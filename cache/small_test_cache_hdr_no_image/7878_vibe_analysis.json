  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Joyful Intention Row' is primarily classified as 'The Meditative Grind' due to its pyramidal structure and moderate jogging pace, which suggests a focus on steady, repetitive movement ideal for zoning in and locking down rhythmically. The workout's intensity level (1 out of 3) supports a meditative pace, and the format prioritizes breathing, indicative of a soothing, repetitive experience. The choice of classic rock and global hits, while not explicitly meditative, complements the steady row with a familiar and steady beat, giving a 0.7 score for 'The Meditative Grind.'\n\n'The Groove Session' is a secondary vibe attributed with a 0.5 score, as the description reflects a fluid and enjoyable experience ('Joyful Intention') with Sera Moon's narrative adding an expressive, moment-focused journey. The song choices have a groove element that aligns with expressive, fun movement.\n\n'The Endorphin Wave' is considered with a 0.4 score due to the workout's inclusion of global hits and continuous movement, likely leading to a steady build of energy and mood, although less prominent than the meditative aspects."
