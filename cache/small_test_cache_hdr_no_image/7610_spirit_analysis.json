  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' because it involves holding a sprint pace and concludes with a push to maximum effort, indicating a fast-paced and demanding session. This is reinforced by the intense rock music playlist including energetic songs by Bon Jovi and Twisted Sister, which enhances the workout's energetic quality, earning a score of 0.9. 'Structured & Disciplined' is the secondary spirit due to the 'interval' format and detailed reference to pacing strategies, suggesting a methodical, disciplined approach (score: 0.7). The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is applicable to a moderate extent as the workout involves continuous rhythmic movement driven by music, but it's not the primary focus (score: 0.4). Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were not applicable due to the workout's structure and environment."
