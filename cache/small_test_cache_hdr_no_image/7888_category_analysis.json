  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is clearly identified as a yoga session based on the title 'Power Flow' and description, which mentions moving through a 'power flow' and yoga blocks being optional. The mention of 'flow' strongly implies a dynamic yoga sequence, specifically power yoga. The 'On The Mat' category further supports that the workout involves exercises performed on an exercise mat, without indicating equipment use beyond optional yoga blocks. \n\nThe choice of music genre and playlist, featuring chill, cool, and downtempo tracks, aligns with the relaxed yet engaging atmosphere typical of a yoga flow session. Although the specific category of Yoga was not mentioned, the cues from metadata clearly indicate a strong presence of yoga elements, justifying a high confidence score.\n\nThe Mat category receives a lower score due to the primary focus being yoga, but it is relevant as it indicates the workout's format. Other categories were excluded due to lack of relevant indicators for activities like cardio or strength training."
