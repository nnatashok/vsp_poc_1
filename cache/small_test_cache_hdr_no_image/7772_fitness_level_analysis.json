  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The title \"Peppy HIIT Row\" and the workout being categorized as \"Drive\" suggests a higher complexity in technique. The term 'drive' in Hydrow workouts typically indicates more advanced rowing strokes, requiring good coordination and body awareness. Considering the high rhythm of 32 strokes per minute, executing these movements effectively requires advanced technique proficiency. Confidence is bolstered by Hydrow-specific classification of 'Drive' workouts as Advanced.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 16:45 minutes with a format labeled HIIT, and a maximum rhythm of 32 strokes per minute, indicating intense intervals. A maximum intensity cue of 3 out of 3 aligns with higher effort. The duration is relatively short but the high intensity merits a 'Challenging' score. Confidence is high due to explicit intensity cues and known demand of HIIT formats. Some alignment with 'Extreme' due to high-intensity intervals, but not sustained long enough to be strongly categorized as such.",
