  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'Indoor rowing' as the title \"Let Go and Row\" and 'Category: row' explicitly indicate a rowing-focused workout. The 'Max rhythm: 32, Format: Interval' suggests high-intensity interval rowing, hence the primary classification as 'Indoor rowing' with a very high confidence score of 0.9. Additionally, 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3' and the emphasis on intervals demonstrate characteristics of HIIT, supporting a secondary classification as 'HIIT' with a high confidence score of 0.7. The use of high-energy music genres (Dance high, Global Hits) and the overall workout duration contributes to the intensity classification. Other categories like 'Stretching' or 'Yoga' are excluded as the metadata heavily emphasizes high-intensity rowing rather than relaxation or flexibility."
