  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title and description highlight a Pilates session, with a focus on strengthening hips and core. The category 'On The Mat' strongly implies the use of a mat as it is a common equipment piece for mat-based Pilates exercises. Thus, there is very high confidence (0.8) that a mat is necessary for comfort and support. The workout does not mention any other specific equipment, and the focus on bodyweight exercises for Pilates suggests that no additional equipment is needed, hence the classification includes only the Mat with a confidence level of 0.8."
