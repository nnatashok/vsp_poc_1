  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, 'Welcome to Norway Row', combines the scenic aspect of rowing in Norway with challenging 1-minute intervals, which aligns with 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe due to its heart-racing, intense nature, evidenced by the max rhythm at 34 and HIIT format. 'The Competitor' vibe is also relevant given the focus on performance in an advanced skill level workout, suggesting a competitive edge. The high-intensity music genre, with songs like 'Higher Love' by Kygo, suggests a motivational soundtrack that fits both 'The Adrenaline Rush' and 'The Competitor'. Finally, the maximal intensity level (3 out of 3) and advanced requirements contribute to the 'The Warrior Workout' vibe, catering to those looking to 'unleash their inner beast'. Though 'The Nightclub Workout' or 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' could be considered due to the pop and global hits music, the primary emphasis is on intensity and competitiveness, justifying the exclusion of these vibes in favor of more intense and performance-oriented ones."
