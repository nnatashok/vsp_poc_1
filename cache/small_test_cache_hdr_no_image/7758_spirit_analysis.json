  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Endurance Intervals Row' exhibits a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit primarily because of its interval format ('2-minute climbing intervals'), suggesting a methodical approach to training. This structure aligns with disciplined execution and progression, matching well with this spirit (score: 0.75). The title itself 'Endurance Intervals Row' and 'Workout Type: sweat' implies a focus on sustained effort and cardiovascular challenge, indicating 'High-Energy & Intense' characteristics (score: 0.65). The mention of a rhythm cap (max rhythm: 28) and the curated playlist including rock and global hits suggest a secondary emphasis on rhythm and maintaining pace, which reflects elements of 'Flow & Rhythm' (score: 0.4). Despite the presence of moderately intense music and the explicit category of 'sweat', it lacks extremely high-energy indicators needed for a higher score in 'High-Energy & Intense'. 'Soothing & Restorative', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are not evident in the data, as the workout is indoor, standard rowing without stress-reduction or sport-specific emphasis."
