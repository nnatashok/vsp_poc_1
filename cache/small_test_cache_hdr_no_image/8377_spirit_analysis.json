  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit due to the emphasis on 'core positioning' and the format being 'Technique', which suggests a methodical approach focused on improving specific rowing skills. The workout's intensity level of 1 out of 3 indicates a lower-intensity, skill-focused session rather than one focused on physical exertion or speed. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant, as the playlist consists of smooth-going Country and Global Hits, which are likely to maintain a rhythmic pace. The maximum stroke rhythm of 26 further supports the presence of a rhythmic undercurrent, though not intensely fast-paced. 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are less applicable given the lack of high intensity or explicit relaxation focus. The confidence score reflects strong indicators of the disciplined and rhythmic nature of this workout."
