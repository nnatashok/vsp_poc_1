  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Technique Cool-Down' prominently suggests a focus on recovery and cooling down, which aligns well with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe that emphasizes deep stretch, low stress, and total-body refresh. The metadata indicates the use of calming rock music, which supports a relaxed workout atmosphere, contributing to a high score of 0.9 for this vibe. Additionally, with a focus on technique and steady rhythm, the workout also fits 'The Meditative Grind', which involves zoning in and repetitive movement, hence a score of 0.7 is appropriate here. The lack of intensity or competitive elements rules out vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor'. The high confidence level of 0.85 arises from explicit indications in the metadata, including the tags \"cool down\" and the rhythmic and calming music choice."
