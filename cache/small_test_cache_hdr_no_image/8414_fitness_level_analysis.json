  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a HIIT row but described as a 'Learn and Burn' session, indicating a focus on engaging, straightforward movements while rowing. The lack of a specific instructor suggests that the movements are not highly technical, aligning with a Beginner to Intermediate level. The use of a standard rowing HIIT format requires some coordination but is not excessively complex, suiting those with a basic understanding of rowing techniques, hence scoring closer to Intermediate as well.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a workout type labeled as 'Sweat' and a mid-range intensity level of 2 out of 3, the effort difficulty is moderate to challenging. The session is a 16-minute HIIT format rowing workout, which demands a consistent energy expenditure. While the duration is not very long, the 28 max rhythm and HIIT categorization suggest bursts of higher intensity which would well challenge deconditioned users, aligning with Moderate to Challenging levels of effort difficulty.",
