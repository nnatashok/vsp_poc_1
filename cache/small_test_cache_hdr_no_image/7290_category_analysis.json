  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as 'Newport Beach HIIT Row,' which strongly indicates a rowing workout that focuses on high-intensity intervals. The description mentions 'ten sets of 1-minute high intensity intervals,' validating the HIIT classification. The 'Max rhythm: 34' and 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3' further reinforce the HIIT nature of the exercise. The use of a rowing-related tag ('row') and the term 'drive' in the workout type suggest action on a rowing machine. Although the genre of music played includes 'Rock Mid-intensity, Global Hits,' indicating a range of energetic sounds, it does not conflict with the primary categorization. Therefore, with no ambiguity, 'Indoor rowing' and 'HIIT' are both very relevant with high confidence scores."
