  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata explicitly categorizes the workout under 'On The Mat,' indicating that a mat is essential for performing floor exercises. Therefore, I assign a very high confidence score of 1.0 to the requirement of a mat. \n\nAdditionally, the description states 'Yoga blocks optional,' indicating that blocks may be used to assist with certain exercises, such as providing support during lunges or squats. However, since the use of blocks is optional as per the description, I assign it a low confidence score of 0.3."
