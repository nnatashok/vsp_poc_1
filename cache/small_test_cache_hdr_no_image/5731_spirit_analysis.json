  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Core Flow' suggests a focus on smooth and continuous movement patterns inherent to yoga flows, indicated by the term 'flow' in both the title and description. This, combined with music labeled as 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo', supports a primary classification as 'Flow & Rhythm' (score: 0.9 for strong match). The setting 'in front of the mountains in Colorado' hints at an appreciation of the natural environment, suggesting elements of 'Outdoor & Adventure'. However, the lack of explicit challenges related to terrain or exploration results in a moderate score of 0.45. The use of calming music and the relaxing nature of yoga also aligns with 'Soothing & Restorative', although the primary emphasis on core engagement prevents this from being the workout's main characteristic, thus receiving a score of 0.4. Overall, the dominant spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm', with outdoor elements and restorative aspects playing less but significant roles."
