  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled 'All in One Row' strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine as the central piece of equipment required. This is further corroborated by the description and tags such as 'row', 'sweat', and 'standard', which imply a rowing-focused workout. The format of intervals, typical in rower workouts, further confirms this. Given the specificity of 'row' in both the category and the workout name, there is very high confidence (1.0) that a rowing machine is essential for this workout. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata."
