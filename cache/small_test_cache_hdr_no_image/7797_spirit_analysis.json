  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Soothing & Restorative' due to the 'cool down' nature indicated in both the title and description. It involves rowing 'steadily' with a maximum rhythm of 20, which aligns with a focus on relaxation and low intensity. The playlist featuring Taylor Swift's 'Lover' and 'Love Story' supports a calming and restorative atmosphere, further reinforcing this spirit. This justifies a high score of 0.8 for this spirit.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is included with a score of 0.7 due to the music-driven aspect of the workout. The flow is emphasized through rhythmic rowing, matching the pace set by the music, which is highlighted by the genre focus on country and global hits, known for their steady and melodic nature.\n\nFinally, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is considered due to rowing along the Charles River, implicating an outdoor, exploration element. However, as the experience leans more toward virtual imagery rather than a physical environment, this spirit is assigned a moderate score of 0.5."
