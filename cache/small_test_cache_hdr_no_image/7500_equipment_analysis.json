  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title \"Runner's Program #6 of 9\" and description clearly position it as a training complement for runners, similar to 400m repeats. The use of terms like \"interval\" and \"drive,standard,row\" in the Workout Type and Category fields strongly implies the centrality of rowing exercises. Based on these descriptions and the structure of the program, the Rowing machine is necessary for completing the workout effectively. The confidence score is set very high at 0.9 because of the repeated references to row-specific activities, ensuring it is essential equipment for this workout. Other equipment is not mentioned or implied, suggesting a focused rowing session."
