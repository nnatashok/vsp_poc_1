  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Post-Row Stretch,' indicating that this stretching routine is intended to follow a rowing session. Therefore, a 'Rowing machine' may have been used beforehand, but isn't needed for the stretch itself. Hence, it is assigned a low confidence score of 0.25. The description emphasizes stretching, specifically mentioning hip flexors and adductors. The category, 'On The Mat,' directly points to the use of a 'Mat' for floor-based exercises, resulting in a high confidence score of 0.9 for the mat. The focus on stretching and its association with being 'On The Mat' strongly implies that no other equipment is needed."
