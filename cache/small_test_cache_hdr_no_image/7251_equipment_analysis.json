  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Bodyweight Strength,\" which already suggests that no equipment is necessary as the focus is on bodyweight exercises. The description explicitly mentions moving through rounds of bodyweight exercises, further confirming that no external equipment is required. The category also includes 'On The Mat,' which typically refers to workouts done on the floor but doesn't necessarily imply the use of a physical mat beyond the workout surface. Given these points, there is very high confidence (0.8-1.0) that this workout requires no additional equipment. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, and no equipment is needed."
