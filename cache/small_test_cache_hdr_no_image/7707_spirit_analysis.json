  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title 'Rhythm 18 Row' and description indicate a focus on maintaining a steady rhythm (at a rate of 18), suggesting a central element of 'Flow & Rhythm'. Additionally, the mention of 'practice patience' implies a smooth, continuous movement emphasizing pacing and coordination, common in Flow & Rhythm workouts. The incorporation of pop music with steady beats from Taylor Swift further supports this spirit, aligning the pacing of the workout with music-driven engagement, resulting in a strong score of 0.7 for 'Flow & Rhythm'.\n\nThe descriptions 'breathe' and 'jogging pace', along with a low intensity level of 1 out of 3 and a beginner-friendly format, point towards a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. These aspects promote an element of relaxation and an easier pace conducive to stress reduction, granting it a score of 0.6. \n\nFinally, the use of a specific rhythm rate (18) and the descriptor 'steady' imply a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, as it requires maintaining controlled pacing and possibly some technical focus, yet this is less dominant, resulting in a moderate score of 0.5. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the absence of high intensity or nature elements."
