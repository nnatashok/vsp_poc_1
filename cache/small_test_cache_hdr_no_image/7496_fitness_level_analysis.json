  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'drive,' which is a specific category in Hydrow that indicates advanced technique requirements. The description posits high intensity intervals similar to sprint track workouts, necessitating good coordination and form to maintain efficiency during rapid bursts. Additionally, the max rhythm of 28 strokes per minute suggests a need for controlled, technical execution to sustain tempo, further aligning this session with an Advanced classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a HIIT format, 1-minute high intensity intervals, and a workout intensity level rated as 3 out of 3, this session places significant demand on physical exertion. The 21-minute duration packs these intervals in a short period, indicative of high energy expenditure and cardiovascular challenge. However, it's not exceedingly extreme due to its relatively short time frame, hence aligning with both Challenging (strongly) and Extreme (reasonably) effort levels for less fit users.",
