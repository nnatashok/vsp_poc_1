  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Steady Adventure Row' features key elements suggesting the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The emphasis on maintaining a consistent split over intervals and music-driven pacing, specifically with songs such as 'The Middle' and 'You Know You Like It', signals a harmonious connection between movement and rhythm (score: 0.7). The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit also fits (score: 0.6) due to the methodical approach involving 'six intervals at varying durations', indicating a planned progression. Lastly, there is a 'Soothing & Restorative' element (score: 0.5), reflected by the 'Breathe' category and low intensity level (1 out of 3), promoting a calming, less intense workout focus. High-energy spirits were excluded due to the low intensity setting, and outdoor factors don't apply as no explicit environmental elements were present."
