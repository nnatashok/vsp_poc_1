  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'drive', which in Hydrow terminology suggests a more challenging level, typically 'Advanced'. The rhythm of 30 adds complexity, necessitating good coordination, proper form, and control during high-intensity intervals. These factors justify a predominantly Advanced classification with some consideration for Expert due to the high-intensity nature and specific rowing form required.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The intensity level is maxed out at 3 out of 3, indicating a demanding workout. The HIIT format, involving 1-minute max effort intervals, further elevates the energy expenditure. Although the workout is under 12 minutes, the lack of longer recovery times results in a Challenging effort level, with some Extreme elements due to continuous high intensity, aligning with these descriptors.",
