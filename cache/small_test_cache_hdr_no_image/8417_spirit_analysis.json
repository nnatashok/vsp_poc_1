  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Upper Body Strength with Bands' appears to focus on 'Structured & Disciplined' aspects, as it emphasizes strength training with a resistance band, suggesting a methodical and progressive approach to muscle building. The use of the term 'Strengthen' coupled with the 'strength' category indicates clear structure in the workout goal, which aligns well with technical precision. The score of 0.75 reflects this strong alignment.\n\nThe presence of pop and global hits like 'Suge', 'Beauty And A Beat', and others adds a rhythmic, engaging element that suggests a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. This music selection encourages a coordinated, music-driven pacing, indicated by such energetic, mainstream tracks, which complements the rhythmic nature of the band exercises. This spirit is supported with a score of 0.65.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is not predominant, as the workout targets all fitness levels, implying variable intensity, and the short duration suggests a focus on form rather than max effort."
