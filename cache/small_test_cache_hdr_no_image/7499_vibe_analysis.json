  "vibesExplanation": "The metadata suggests a low-intensity stretching workout focused on recovery. The workout emphasizes stretching key muscle groups like hips, legs, and ankles, tailored for runners. This aligns closely with 'The Reboot Workout,' which involves low stress and total-body refreshment. The score of 0.75 reflects the strong alignment with this vibe, given the focus on stretching post-run and utilizing equipment like yoga blocks. \n\n'Zen Flow' is a fitting secondary vibe due to the grounding, breath-centered nature typically associated with stretching routines, especially after a run when muscle relaxation and breath work are emphasized. The unobtrusive, calming music (including tracks like 'Sweater Weather' which have a relaxed, atmospheric quality) supports this vibe, meriting a score of 0.65.\n\nThe music genre of 'Dance mid, Global Hits' suggests a more upbeat tone, but given the activity is primarily stretching, it solidifies the focus on refreshment and relaxation rather than high intensity or energetic vibes."
