  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is structured as 'Climbing Intervals Row' with intervals of 3', 2', and 1' minutes, progressing from 22 to 26 strokes per minute. These are relatively straightforward rowing intervals indicating a requirement to maintain rhythm but no complex maneuvers. While fundamental rowing technique is needed, which may suggest a slight push into 'Intermediate', the overall movements are basic and accessible, aligning strongly with 'Beginner' due to the emphasis on fundamentals.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves a duration of 21 minutes, described with intervals that increase in stroke rate, featured as an intensity level of 1 out of 3. Such details indicate it's designed to be fairly accessible with moderate challenge. Given short work intervals, typically light to moderate exertion is suitable for those starting. The workout aims to reinforce basic rowing endurance rather than induce high-intensity effort, suiting both 'Light' and 'Moderate' classifications.",
