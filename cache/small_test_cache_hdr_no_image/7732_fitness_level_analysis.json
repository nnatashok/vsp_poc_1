  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is relatively short at approximately 16 minutes and categorized under 'align', focusing more on flexibility and alignment rather than intense physical exertion. The playlist comprises chill and downtempo music, further suggesting a low-energy, gentle session. This supports the primary classification as Light effort, with a minor acknowledgment of possible moderate effort due to the backbend focus.",
