The description highlights 'mobility,' which is often associated with mat-based exercises, supporting the 'Mat' category with strong confidence (score 0.9). The mention of 'fix your posture' also implies activities that might include flexibility or range of motion exercises, aligning with aspects of 'Stretching,' justifying a mid-high score (0.7). The 'On The Mat' label further reinforces that the primary activity is performed on an exercise mat.
