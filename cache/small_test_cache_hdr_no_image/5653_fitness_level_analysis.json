Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a 20-minute duration and a description indicating a HIIT style meant to elevate heart rate, it strongly points to a 'Challenging' effort level. HIIT workouts typically push cardiovascular limits and are designed to be intense with minimal rest, making them more demanding for deconditioned users. The playlist's high-energy songs likely encourage high intensity, indicative of a moderately demanding workout. There's high confidence this aligns with 'Challenging', as it's well-suited to users who are out of shape but seeking to push their limits.",
