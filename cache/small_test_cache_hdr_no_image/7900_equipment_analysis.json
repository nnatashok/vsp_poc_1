  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Pop Row', along with descriptors such as 'row', 'sprint pace', '90-second intervals', and 'max pace', strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. The repeated emphasis on rowing terminology, combined with the category 'Drive,standard,row', provides very high confidence that a rowing machine is essential for this workout. The music playlist and pacing detail ('90-second intervals with a 30-second push') is consistent with typical indoor rowing exercises focused on rhythm and endurance. Therefore, the confidence score for the rowing machine is set at 0.9, reflecting the central role it plays in the described workout."
