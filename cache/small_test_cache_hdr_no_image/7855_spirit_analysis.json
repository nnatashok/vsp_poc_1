  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.9 due to explicit indicators suggesting a high-intensity session. The use of 'HIIT' in the title and description, combined with the '3 out of 3' intensity level and 'Advanced' fitness level, strongly supports this classification. The short duration (11 minutes) and fast intervals (50-second and 10-second at high rhythms of 26 and 32) further reinforce the intense nature of this workout. The 'Drive' tag and music choice, featuring upbeat pop and global hits, aligns with high-energy vibes, aimed to maintain high motivation and adrenaline throughout the session. 'Flow & Rhythm' is also present with a score of 0.6, as the workout involves rhythmic pacing and coordination between intervals, highlighted by the structured rhythm changes and the music-driven environment. 'Structured & Disciplined' was considered but excluded as the description emphasizes intensity and speed rather than technical precision or methodical progression."
