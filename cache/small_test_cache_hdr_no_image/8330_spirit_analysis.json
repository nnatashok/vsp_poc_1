  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title 'Twists Flow' and the description that mentions opening shoulders, chest, and back suggest a smooth, continuous movement pattern that is characteristic of the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The emphasis on a 'twists flow' indicates a focus on coordination and movement harmony. The use of music genres described as chill and downtempo, along with tracks like 'Firefly' and 'Something About You', supports a fluid and rhythm-driven session, contributing to a high confidence in this spirit. The 'Chill mid' and 'Cool/Downtempo' radio stations reinforce a laid-back, flowing nature, furthering the alignment with 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.8.\n\n'On The Mat' category, short duration, and the mention of opening the body parts suggest a soothing, gentle session aimed at relaxation and mild restoration, which aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. However, this aspect is less pronounced than the flow element, leading to a moderately high match with a score of 0.6. No explicit elements suggest structure, intensity, sport-focus, or outdoor adventure, so those spirits were excluded."
