  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Foundation Builder' with a score of 0.8. This is due to the focus on a 'whole body' workout aimed at beginners, suggesting a workout designed to strengthen foundational elements and improve basic fitness levels across the body. The inclusion of 'strength' as a workout type further supports this vibe, as it implies building and reinforcing muscle groups, aligning with foundational goals rather than intense or explosive training. The 'Masterclass Workout' vibe also has relevance with a score of 0.6, as the workout is described as 'approachable,' which suggests instructional, technique-driven guidance, especially suitable for varying fitness levels from beginner to advanced. The lack of an instructor named and unspecified music genre do provide some uncertainty, leading to a moderate confidence level of 0.75 for the overall vibe classification. 'The Groove Session' or 'The Endorphin Wave' were excluded due to the lack of emphasis on fluidity or elevated steady energy typically associated with musical influence and emotional upliftment."
