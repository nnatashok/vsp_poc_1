  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Bodyweight Strength' is set against the backdrop of the lush mountains of Norway, suggesting elements of 'Outdoor & Adventure'. However, since the workout takes place 'On the Mat', the primary environment is more focused on a stationary, studio-like practice with natural views, thus assigning it a relatively moderate score of 0.5 for the adventurous element. The playlist featuring songs with danceable beats and global hits indicates a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, which is strongly suggested by the rhythmic quality of the music, earning it a score of 0.7. Although it is a 'strength' workout, the scenic outdoor setting may also provide a sense of relaxation, leading to the inclusion of 'Soothing & Restorative.' As the workout emphasizes 'engaging your core and building stability', it combines stability and flow with moderate soothing elements, making it a suitable fit with a score of 0.4 in the restorative aspect."
