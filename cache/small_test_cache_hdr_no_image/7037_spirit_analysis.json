  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata strongly suggests a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to the workout type ('stretching') and focus on areas typically targeted for recovery ('hip flexors and adductors'). The short duration of 5 minutes and 45 seconds further implies a restorative aim rather than an intense session, leading to an extremely strong match with this spirit (0.85 score). The use of music genres like 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' suggests some element of 'Flow & Rhythm', introducing a slight musical pacing or coordination aspect, earning it a moderate score of 0.6. Despite music being present, the dominant emphasis remains on stretching, making other high-energy spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' less applicable. There's high confidence (0.85) in the classification due to explicit cues in the description and content format."
