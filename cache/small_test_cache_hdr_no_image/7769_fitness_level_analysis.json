Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is short at 5 minutes and 50 seconds, typical of cooldown sessions that focus on gradually lowering heart rates rather than high energy output. The use of terms like 'gentle' and 'smooth rhythm' suggests a soft close to a previous workout or activity, indicating minimal physical exertion. There are no mentions of intense physical demands, energy expenditure, or extensive sets or reps, which aligns with a 'Light' effort level (score 1.0).",
