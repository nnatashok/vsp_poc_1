  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Runner's Program #4 of 9', suggesting a focus on building a runner's aerobic capacity. The description mentions '3' intervals at low rhythms' hinting at a cardio session that could align with aerobic training, potentially on a rowing machine. The reference to 'Max rhythm: 24, Format: Steady' suggests rowing terminology, with stroke rates being a key metric, hence 'Indoor rowing' is given a score of 0.7. The workout type listed as 'breathe' also supports 'Breathing exercises', particularly with the emphasis on building aerobic capacity; thus, it is scored 0.6. Although 'Runner's Program' could suggest running, there's insufficient evidence of an actual running session, but due to the contextual association, it is considered albeit with a lower score of 0.4. Each selected category reflects different aspects mentioned in the workout metadata, with higher confidence in the rowing aspect due to terminology and structure."
