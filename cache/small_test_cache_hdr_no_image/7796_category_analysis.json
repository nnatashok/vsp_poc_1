  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 0.9, as the workout is explicitly stated as 'Climbing Intervals Row'. The use of terms 'intervals' and 'climbing from 22 to 26' strongly suggests a rowing machine workout focused on increasing stroke rate. The format indicates a structured rowing session with rhythmic intensity adjustments (climb from 22 to 26 strokes per minute) typical in indoor rowing.\n\nThe secondary category considered is 'Breathing exercises' with a score of 0.3, inferred from the 'Work type: breathe' metadata and the mention of 'remind yourself of the fundamentals', suggesting a focus on breathing technique during the workout. However, since the primary activity is rowing, this is less central to the workout's classification.\n\nThe duration of approximately 21 minutes, combined with a low intensity level (1 out of 3), aligns with a guided indoor rowing session rather than a full breathing exercise routine."
