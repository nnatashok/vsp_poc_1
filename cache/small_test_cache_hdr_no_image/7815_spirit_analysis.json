  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Core Strength' suggests a focus on building core strength in a quick and efficient manner. The use of upbeat and energetic songs like 'Shivers (Dillon Francis Remix)' and 'Watch Your Step' suggests a dynamic music-driven atmosphere, which aligns with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. This classification receives a score of 0.7 as the music and the term 'ignite' from the description imply intensity. Despite the short duration of the workout, the structured approach to targeting the core specifically aligns it with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, suggesting a methodical focus on core muscles, receiving a score of 0.6. Other spirits, such as 'Flow & Rhythm', have minimal indicators due to the absence of indications of continuous movement patterns or mind-body focus, and 'Soothing & Restorative' is less applicable given the workout's emphasis on core ignition rather than relaxation."
