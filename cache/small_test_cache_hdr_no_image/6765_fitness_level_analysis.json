  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Drive' with a max rhythm of 30, indicating a fast-paced rowing session. The 'Drive' category generally aligns with Advanced technique difficulty in Hydrow-specific guidelines, as it requires significant control and understanding of the rowing stroke. Additionally, the 'HIIT' format suggests complex movements due to the need for swift transitions and maintenance of proper form under high intensity. These elements significantly increase the complexity, making it Advanced difficulty.",

This suggests intervals with short recovery, which typically involve intense bursts of effort, fitting a Challenging category for less fit users. While not Extreme, due to the feasible length and energy demands, it demands significant effort and is appropriate for users ready to be pushed.",
