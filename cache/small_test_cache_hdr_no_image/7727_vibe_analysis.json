  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Cardio Cruise Row' is centered around a low-intensity, endurance-focused style, as evidenced by terms like 'low intensity', 'longer workout', and a maximum rhythm of 26, suggesting a steady pace. This aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind', a category characterized by repetitive, endurance-based, and mentally centering activities, meriting a score of 0.8. The inclusion of breathing focus and intention-setting in the description supports the vibe of 'The Zen Flow', which tends to be more intentional and breath-centered, earning it a score of 0.6. Additionally, the use of classic rock and global hits from the '60s and '70s provides a feel-good background that fosters elevated, steady energy\u2014characteristics of 'The Endorphin Wave', hence a score of 0.5. The low intensity level, 'breathe' category, and beginner-friendly format are key indicators favoring these vibes over other high-intensity or competition-driven categories."
