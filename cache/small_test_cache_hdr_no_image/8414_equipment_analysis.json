  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title \"Learn and Burn Row\" and the category tags explicitly mention rowing, indicating that a rowing machine is central to this workout. Additionally, the workout description supports a rowing-focused routine by highlighting a theme of cruising, akin to rowing, with an emphasis on whales and glaciers that can metaphorically suggest movement across water. Given these consistent references to rowing, there is very high confidence that a rowing machine is required for this workout. The confidence score is assigned as 0.9 to reflect this explicit connection to rowing."
