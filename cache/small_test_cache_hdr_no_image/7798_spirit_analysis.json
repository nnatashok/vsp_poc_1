  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is predominantly classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to several explicit indicators. The title 'Running Up the Hill Row' suggests a challenging workout, and the description further specifies 'four phases of HIIT intervals,' a hallmark of high-intensity training. Additionally, the workout intensity level is explicitly marked as 3 out of 3, reinforcing its vigorous nature. The use of music from 80's hits like 'Running Up That Hill,' which is typically high in energy, supports this classification. The playlist's upbeat, energetic song choices further underscore this spirit.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also present, albeit to a lesser extent, as the workout is music-driven, which is a key component of the flow and rhythmic connection, scored at 0.5. However, given the primary focus on HIIT and intensity, 'Flow & Rhythm' is secondary and is more indirectly inferred from the playlist and pacing implied by a rhythm of 'Max rhythm: 30.' Other spirits were excluded due to a lack of structural focus, athletic specificity, or relaxation elements in the metadata."
