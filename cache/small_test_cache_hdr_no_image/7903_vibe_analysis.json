  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Climbing Intervals Row' workout features a mid-level intensity, with a focus on rhythmic climbing, making it a strong candidate for 'The Meditative Grind.' The workout emphasizes repetition and rhythm, 'climbing in rhythm and intensity,' which aligns with characteristics of this vibe. The music playlist featuring multiple Ed Sheeran songs, with a consistent pop beat, supports this classification. A score of 0.75 reflects the strong match to this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is applicable given the steady build in intensity across the intervals ('climbing in rhythm and intensity') and its categorization under 'sweat,' suggesting an elevated but steady effort over the 21-minute duration. This captures feel-good, sustained movement, with a score of 0.7 indicating a strong fit.\n\nFinally, 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' could be considered due to the music-driven aspect and 'rhythm' mentioned in the description, although this aspect is less dominant, reflected in a moderate score of 0.55. 'The Nightclub Workout' does not fit well due to the non-dance-oriented, row-based format."
