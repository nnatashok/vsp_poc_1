  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, labeled as a 'drive' type, is associated with advanced-level technique requirements, involving explosive power and speed, which requires significant rowing experience and body awareness. The description mentions 'exploding with power,' which indicates complex movements requiring precise execution. Although there is no specific mention of technique-demanding movements beyond the rowing aspects, the intensity and the need for sustained power output suggest an advanced technique, with a minor consideration for expert elements, mainly driven by the Hydrow-specific emphasis.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described with a high intensity level (3 out of 3) across a relatively short duration (21 minutes) with 'power and speed' focus and a final all-out effort, placing a high demand on energy expenditure. The burst format, combined with music tempo, suggests a challenging pace, aligning with the 'Drive' and 'Power' formats indicative of significant effort. This combination results in a challenging effort difficulty with elements nearing extreme, primarily due to the need for sustaining power at high intensity levels.",
