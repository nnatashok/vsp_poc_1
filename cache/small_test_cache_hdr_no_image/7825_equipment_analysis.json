  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Climbing Intervals Warm-Up' and description emphasize a climbing rhythm, which is consistent with rowing sessions that often include interval training. The 'Category' field explicitly mentions 'row', strongly suggesting the use of a rowing machine. This categorization, combined with the lack of mention of other types of equipment, leads to a high confidence level (0.8) that a rowing machine is required. The focus on 'climb' and 'rhythm' further indicates the use of a rowing machine, as these are common terms used in rowing workouts to describe the pace and intensity of rowing intervals."
