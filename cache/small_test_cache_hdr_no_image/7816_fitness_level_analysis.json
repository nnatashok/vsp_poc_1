  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, labeled as 'breathe' and featuring a steady state rhythm at 22, suggests that the movement complexity is low. The 'breathe' category implies a focus on maintaining a steady pace rather than complex forms. The absence of high-intensity or technical moves further supports a Beginner level classification. The Intermediate score reflects the rhythmic coordination needed, but this is limited given the simplified steady format of the row.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is relatively light in physical demand, indicated by the steady state rhythm of 22 and a duration of 16 minutes 20 seconds. Rated as 1 out of 3 in intensity, it aligns well with 'light' effort, suitable for lower fitness levels. The moderate score accounts for the continuous rowing without breaks, which may present a slight challenge to very unfit individuals, but overall, the workout remains accessible to beginners.",
