  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Core Flow' and the description mentions a yoga flow focusing on core engagement, which strongly suggests that a mat is needed. The category 'On The Mat' reinforces the idea that the exercises are performed on a mat. Yoga typically requires a mat for comfort and safety during floor exercises. Therefore, I have assigned a confidence level of 0.9, as the use of a mat is central to a yoga flow workout."
