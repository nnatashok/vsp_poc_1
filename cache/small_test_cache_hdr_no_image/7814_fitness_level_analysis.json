Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is marked as a 'warm-up' with a moderate duration of 10 minutes and 45 seconds, and is designed to gradually increase rhythm. This suggests light to moderate energy expenditure typical of warm-up activities. The effort level is skewed towards 'Light' given the workout type, but the rhythm climb can also justify a small degree of 'Moderate' effort.",
