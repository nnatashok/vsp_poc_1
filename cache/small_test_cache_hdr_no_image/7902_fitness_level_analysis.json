  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty stems from the rowing workout, categorized as 'sweat' with an interval format. Rowing generally has a moderate complexity, necessitating correct form for efficiency and injury prevention. However, the implied user fitness level of 'Intermediate' and the context suggesting a 'sweat' level workout signifies that beginners familiar with basic rowing can participate. The 'max rhythm' of 28 strokes aligns with simple-to-moderate rowing techniques, suitable for beginners to intermediate users. Thus, the technique difficulty scores primarily as 'Beginner' with a strong overlap into the 'Intermediate' level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified between 'Moderate' and 'Challenging'. The workout duration is 16 minutes and 18 seconds, which is relatively short, reducing the cardiovascular burden. The 'interval' format with a max rhythm of 28 strokes invites a moderate effort, heightened by driving rock and metal beats, which can encourage exertion. An intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggests a noticeable challenge for deconditioned users, making the effort primarily 'Moderate', with some 'Challenging' characteristics. This reflects in the scoring, where physical effort aligns mostly with 'Moderate' but with some 'Challenging' influences.",
