  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as '80s Intervals Row', indicating a focus on rhythmic rowing intervals. Given the 'sweat' workout type and max rhythm of 30, the movements mainly involve traditional rowing techniques at varying intensities rather than intricate technical variations. Intervals imply some complexity as they require rhythm control and coordination when transitioning between intensities. Accordingly, this aligns more with an Intermediate technique difficulty due to the required coordination, but can still accommodate some Beginner elements due to the fundamental nature of rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 21 minutes with a focus on 'sweat', highlighting a cardiovascular and endurance focus. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggests it is moderately challenging, designed to elevate heart rate and involve significant exertion especially with interval formats. The combination of 'sweat' and interval format strongly suggests a Challenging effort difficulty while still maintaining access for less fit users due to the short duration and use of music to motivate.",
