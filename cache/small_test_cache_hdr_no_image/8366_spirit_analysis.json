  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a very strong score of 0.9. This classification is supported by the following indicators: the workout description emphasizes 'race off at high rhythms' and 'accumulate maximum meters', which suggests a focus on intensity and exertion. Additionally, the workout intensity level is marked as 3 out of 3, confirming the high intensity of the session. The use of terms like 'Power' and 'Drive' further suggest a vigorous effort, aligning with this spirit. The secondary classification of 'Flow & Rhythm' is assigned a score of 0.7, reflecting the importance of 'high rhythms' in the session. Although the workout is driven by rhythm, thus indicating a smooth and continuous engagement, it is not the central theme, hence it receives a lower score than 'High-Energy & Intense'. The provided playlist, consisting of energetic songs from Pop and Global Hits radio stations, reinforces both intensity and rhythmic flow. Other potential spirits were considered but excluded due to the lack of evidence for recovery focus, structure, sport-specific skills, or an outdoor context."
