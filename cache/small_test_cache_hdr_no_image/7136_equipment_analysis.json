  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'On The Mat' and involves restorative practices, which strongly implies the use of a mat. The title 'Finding Breath and Stillness Restore' and the description mentioning a focus on breath in each pose suggest activities typical of yoga or pilates done on a mat. The very high confidence score of 0.95 is justified by the multiple references to a mat in the category and the nature of the workout, which aligns with exercises typically done on a mat."
