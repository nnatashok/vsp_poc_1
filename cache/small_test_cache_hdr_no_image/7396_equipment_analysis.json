  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'On The Mat,' which explicitly suggests the use of a mat as central to the workout. This categorization aligns with the common use of mats for exercises performed on the floor, including strength workouts. Additionally, the workout's title 'Beginner Whole Body Strength' in conjunction with the category implies exercises that are floor-based, where a mat typically provides comfort and traction. As such, the confidence score for the mat is very high at 0.9, given its direct mention and relevance to the workout type. No other equipment is indicated in the metadata or title."
