  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Twists Flow\" and categorized under \"On The Mat,\" which strongly implies that a mat is the primary piece of equipment used. The description mentions an emphasis on opening shoulders, chest, and back, which are typical movements in mat-based flows like yoga or pilates. The category \"On The Mat\" further supports this, suggesting a very high confidence that a mat is essential for this workout. There is no mention of other equipment in the metadata, reinforcing the conclusion that it is likely a bodyweight workout done on a mat."
