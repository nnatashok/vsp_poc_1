  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, labeled as a standard row with a 'sweat' type, suggests movements typically seen in rowing workouts like Catch and Drive. With a max rhythm of 26, the movements would require some coordination and body awareness, aligning with Intermediate-level technique. However, due to the absence of an instructor and potentially simple rhythmic rowing, a portion aligns with Beginner techniques.",

The music tempo aligned with rock can motivate, increasing energy expenditure slightly, indicating a Moderate effort overall. However, since the duration is not excessively long, part of the effort could be light for very low fitness individuals.",
