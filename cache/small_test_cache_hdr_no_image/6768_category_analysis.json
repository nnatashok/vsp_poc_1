  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is categorically a Stretching session due to the explicit mention of stretches focusing on the back muscles using a foam roller. The workout name and description directly refer to 'stretching' as the primary activity, indicating its central role in the workout and warranting a high score of 0.9 for the Stretching category. The tags also mention 'on-the-mat,' which suggests that exercises are likely performed on a mat, justifying the Mat category with a moderate score of 0.6. However, this is less emphasized compared to Stretching, and largely inferred from the mention of 'on-the-mat' rather than specific exercise details. The setting in Miami and the use of upbeat music, while notable, do not alter the primary focus on stretching activities. Other categories such as Yoga or Pilates are excluded due to lack of mindfulness or core strength references."
