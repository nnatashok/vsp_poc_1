  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title of the workout, \"Endurance Intervals Row,\" along with its description and categorization as \"row,\" strongly indicates the need for a rowing machine. The mention of 'intervals' and 'climbing' in the workout further reinforces this, as such terminology is often associated with rowing workouts aimed at building endurance through varied intensity and stroke rates. The very high importance of the rowing machine to the central structure of the workout justifies a confidence score of 0.9. No other equipment is mentioned or implied for this specific format and style of workout."
