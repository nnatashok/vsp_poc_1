  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' indicates complex technical aspects of rowing, often requiring experienced technique awareness, aligning strongly with an Advanced rating. Intermediate alignment is also noted due to 'Interval' format, which may introduce varied stroke techniques that require some practice but not complexity beyond intermediate rowing skills.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 21-minute interval session and a maximum rhythm of 32 imply a physically demanding workout. Although its intensity level is 3 out of 3, typically signaling Extreme effort, the duration limits extended energy depletion, aligning closer to Challenging, with some overlap into Extreme due to high rhythm and interval nature.",
