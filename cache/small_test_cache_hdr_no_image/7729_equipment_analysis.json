  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Pause Drill Cool-Down' and description 'Reinforce technique as Mac leads you through pause drills along the Connecticut River' strongly imply that this is a rowing session. Additionally, the category tags include 'row,' further indicating the use of a rowing machine. The combination of 'cool down' and 'technique' suggests the focus is on refining rowing forms post-intensive workout. The rowing machine is likely central to performing the pause drills mentioned. Therefore, the rowing machine is identified as necessary equipment with very high confidence, 0.9, because \"pause drills\" are a common rowing technique practice."
