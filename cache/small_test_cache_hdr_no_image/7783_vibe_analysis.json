  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Welcome to Norway Flow', immediately suggests a gentle and intentional experience, aligning with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The serene surroundings of Norway and the use of words like 'core-focused flow' in the description emphasize a grounding and breath-centered quality, leading to a strong match with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, scored at 0.85. The playlist, featuring chill mid and cool/downtempo tracks, further reinforces a calming, flowing atmosphere.\n\n'Nature Flow' is partially applicable due to the setting in a natural environment (Norway), making the experience more immersive and open-air, thus scoring it at 0.6 as it fits the vibe of an outdoor rhythm-driven workout.\n\n'Groove Session' garners a mild match (0.4) due to the expressive and fluid elements implied by a flow workout, although the workout appears to focus more on calmness rather than fun or high energy, which would have increased the Groove aspect."
