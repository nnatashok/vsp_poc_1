  "vibesExplanation": "The chosen vibes for this workout are 'The Meditative Grind,' 'The Endorphin Wave,' and 'The Groove Session.' The 'Meditative Grind' is represented by the focus on technique and steady rhythm changes with the maximum rhythm reaching 28, typical of endurance rowing. This gives it a repetitive, focused energy. The score of 0.7 reflects this, as the workout aligns well with endurance-based rowing. 'The Endorphin Wave' matches due to the intensity level (2 out of 3), which indicates a steady but challenging effort likely to lift energy levels and produce feel-good movement. Its score is 0.6, capturing its relevance given the endurance and intermediate level requirement. Lastly, 'The Groove Session' is considered due to the Latin and Global Hits playlist, suggesting a playful, rhythmic undertone with popular artists like J Balvin and Anitta. While the music's presence is noticeable, its influence on the workout style is less dominant, thus earning a score of 0.4. The strong music presence creates a potentially fun and rhythmic vibe without fully defining the workout."
