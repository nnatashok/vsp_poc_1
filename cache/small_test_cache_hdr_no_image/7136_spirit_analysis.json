  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Finding Breath and Stillness Restore' strongly aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as evidenced by the clear emphasis on restoration and relaxation described in the metadata. The use of terms like 'breath' and 'restorative practice' in the title and description highlights the workout's focus on healing and gentle movements. The music genres specified as 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' further support this classification by suggesting a calm and relaxing ambiance. Due to these strong indicators, this spirit receives a high score of 0.95.\n\nThe element of 'Flow & Rhythm' can be considered as a secondary spirit with a score of 0.4. This is inferred from the mention of feeling the breath in each pose, suggesting some continuous movement and coordination, although this is not the primary focus. The absence of high-intensity or structured elements, as well as the environment being 'On The Mat,' helps exclude other potential spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Outdoor & Adventure.' Overall, the metadata provides a high confidence level for the identified spirits."
