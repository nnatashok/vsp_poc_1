  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video 'Synchronization Cool-Down' features a cool-down session with a rowing theme, indicated by terms such as 'Synchronization' and references to 'standard,row'. Additionally, the setting described as 'at sunset on the Charles River' and the use of rowing-related terminology like 'Max rhythm: 22' point towards an Indoor Rowing category. Indoor rowing is supported by the categories 'Cool Down,standard,row', suggesting this is a low-intensity rowing session. This leads to a strong presence of the 'Indoor rowing' category (score: 0.8).\n\nThe 'cool down' context and phrase 'gentle and smooth rhythm' imply the session is focused on relaxation and transition, which aligns with Stretching (score: 0.4). There are no indicators for more intense categories like HIIT or Weight workout, as the session aims for calmness rather than exertion.\n\nThe confidence level is high due to explicit rowing references and the cool-down emphasis, fitting well within the Indoor Rowing and Stretching categories."
