  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.9. This is due to several key pieces of metadata: the workout's high intensity level ('3 out of 3'), the inclusion of rhythm and interval formats, and the music from high-energy radio stations like 'Dance high' and 'Global Hits,' featuring fast-paced and powerful songs by artists like Nelly and Rita Ora. These suggest a high-intensity emotional and physical experience aimed at pushing limits. \n\nThe secondary classification is 'Flow & Rhythm,' scored at 0.6. The emphasis on 'rhythm' and the playlist's continuous and music-driven nature imply a focus on maintaining a synchronized and rhythmic rowing motion. The description's phrase 'breathe, observe, and then act' suggests elements of fluidity and connection between mind and body, typical of Flow & Rhythm. \n\nOther spirits were not applicable due to lack of evidence in structure, restorative focus, sports specificity, or outdoor elements."
