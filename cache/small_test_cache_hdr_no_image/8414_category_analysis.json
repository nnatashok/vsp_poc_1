  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary classification for this workout is \"Indoor rowing\" with a high score of 0.9 because the title and description explicitly mention 'row', indicating the core activity is rowing. Additionally, the term 'sweat', along with an intensity level of '2 out of 3', suggests a physically demanding workout. The format 'HIIT' in the metadata reinforces this as it describes a type of workout characterized by high intensity, supporting a secondary classification as \"HIIT\" with a score of 0.7. The mention of learning about whales and glaciers suggests a potentially engaging, scenic workout, but this does not alter the primary classification. Other categories like 'Mat' or 'Body weight' are excluded due to the clear emphasis on rowing."
