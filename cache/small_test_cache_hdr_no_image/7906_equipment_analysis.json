  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title 'Endurance Builder Row' and the description both strongly suggest the use of a rowing machine. Specifically, the terms 'endurance builder' and 'row' in combination with 'intervals' indicate that this is a rowing workout. Additionally, the category includes 'row', reinforcing the high confidence that a rowing machine is necessary for this exercise. Despite no explicit mention of the equipment within the text, the context and repeat reference to rowing-related activities strongly imply that a rowing machine is central to the workout. Therefore, the confidence score for including a rowing machine is set very high, at 0.95."
