  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary categorization of this workout as 'Yoga' is strongly supported by the title 'Beginner Yoga Flow' and the description mentioning a 'beginner friendly flow.' These phrases explicitly indicate a yoga session designed for beginners, which includes a sequence of connected poses typically found in yoga. The usage of terms like 'flow' is strongly associated with yoga practices that often involve a series of posture transitions, justifying a high confidence level in this category with a score of 0.9. Additionally, the 'flow' aspect of the workout coupled with the option of yoga blocks suggests 'Stretching' as a secondary aspect, as these blocks help in flexibility and support in poses, warranting a moderate presence score of 0.5. Chill music choices align with yoga and stretching sessions, contributing to the relaxing environment typical of such practices."
