  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Advanced HIIT Row' and includes metadata tags such as 'row' and 'drive,' which strongly indicate the use of a rowing machine. The workout description emphasizes 'high rhythms at maximum effort,' consistent with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on a rowing machine. Given the explicit mention of 'row' in both the workout type and category, the confidence score for a rowing machine being required is very high at 1.0. No other equipment is suggested or implied by the metadata, making the rowing machine central to the workout."
