  "vibesExplanation": "The metadata for 'Express Bootcamp HIIT Row' suggests a high-intensity, fast-paced workout, which fits well with 'The Firestarter' vibe. The use of HIIT format with 50-second and 10-second intervals at high rhythms (26 and 32) aligns perfectly with the description of explosive and electrifying workouts. Furthermore, the description of a 'Drive' workout and the intensity level being 3 out of 3 highlight the demanding and vigorous nature, supporting this classification. The playlist featuring upbeat and energetic tracks like 'Levels' by Avicii and 'Shape Of You' by Ed Sheeran also points towards a high-energy session. Additionally, the term 'Bootcamp' implies a rigorous exercise setting akin to 'The Warrior Workout,' where primal energy and maximum effort are desired, thus complementing 'The Firestarter.' However, since the music leans more towards popular global hits rather than strictly high-intensity tracks, it slightly tempers the Warrior vibe. Overall, the primary vibe is 'The Firestarter' with 'The Warrior Workout' as a secondary vibe, given the aggressive pace and intensity."
