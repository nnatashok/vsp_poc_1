  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Comeback Row' features elements that strongly align with 'The Endorphin Wave' and 'The Meditative Grind'. The title and description emphasize a gradual progression ('Gradually build in rhythm'), which is a key aspect of 'The Endorphin Wave' as it focuses on feel-good, steady build movement. The use of rhythmic and alternative music ('Indie Alternative, Global Hits') suggests an elevated but soulful vibe, which is congruent with raising endorphins. The score of 0.7 reflects this well.\n\nSimultaneously, the 'Meditative Grind' fits due to the emphasis on rhythm and a low intensity, namely 'breathe' and 'standard' format, indicating a zone-in and repetitive nature typical of endurance rowing sessions. The relatively long duration for a beginner, combined with rhythm and an absence of a named instructor, suggests a more introspective and personal focus during the workout. The score of 0.6 indicates its slightly lesser but significant alignment.\n\nOther vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' are less appropriate due to the low intensity and beginner focus, suitable for a more gentle, progressive session."
