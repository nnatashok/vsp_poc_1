  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title 'Pure Energy Row' and description explicitly indicate a high-intensity focus with intervals, along with a 3 out of 3 intensity level, strongly aligning with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The workout is part of the 'Drive, standard, row' category and uses an interval format (HIIT), reinforcing the vigorous nature consistent with this spirit, leading to a very high confidence rating of 0.95. Music from genres such as 'Dance high' and 'Global Hits', along with upbeat tracks by Pitbull and others, supports a lively pace, providing a secondary indication for 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit at 0.65. Despite being set 'along the Charles River,' there is insufficient evidence that this significantly influences the workout's environment or style; hence, 'Outdoor & Adventure' receives a lower score of 0.25. Structured & Disciplined was excluded due to the lack of a structured progression emphasis, and Soothing & Restorative was clearly inappropriate given the intense nature of the session."
