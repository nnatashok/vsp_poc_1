  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified with a focus on 'Flow & Rhythm,' 'Structured & Disciplined,' and 'High-Energy & Intense' spirits. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit receives a high score of 0.8 as the workout involves climbing in rhythm with a set max rhythm of 32, indicating an emphasis on coordinating movement with musical beats, supported by the continuous Ed Sheeran pop hits that encourage staying in sync. 'Structured & Disciplined' gains a score of 0.7, given the workout's format following specific climbing intervals with increasing intensity, typical of methodical, progressive training. The reference to 'sweat' and the intensity level of 2 out of 3 contributes to the high-energy spirit, providing a score of 0.6, highlighting a balanced but noticeable intensity. Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative,' 'Sport & Agility,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are not represented due to the explicit indoor rowing context focused on rhythmic and structured exertion rather than relaxation, athletic skill, or outdoor challenges."
