  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title \"Welcome to Norway Flow\" and the category 'On The Mat, standard, on-the-mat' strongly suggest that this workout is performed on a mat. The term 'flow' typically implies a series of movements often associated with yoga or pilates, exercises which generally require a mat for comfort and support. This is further supported by the mention of 'core-focused flow,' which usually involves mat-based exercises. Given these indications, we have a very high confidence (0.9) that a mat is necessary for this workout."
