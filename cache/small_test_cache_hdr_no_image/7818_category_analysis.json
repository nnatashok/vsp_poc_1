  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Indoor rowing' with a confidence score of 0.9 because the workout directly mentions 'steady row' and segments aiming specific muscles (arms, core, legs) while maintaining a rowing rhythm of 22. This indicates the use of a rowing machine for a structured exercise session. \n\n'Breathing exercises' also gets a score of 0.4. The workout is branded as 'breathe' with a lower intensity level of 1 out of 3, which might include a focus on controlled breathing, particularly given the relaxed, steady pace of the exercise. However, since explicit breathing practice is not detailed, its presence is only considered moderately. \n\nThe intensity level being 1 out of 3 suggests this may not be high-intensity, confirming the relaxed nature of the session but still within the constraints of indoor rowing. Categories like 'Stretching', 'Mat', or 'Yoga' were excluded as there is no indication of activities related to those forms, and 'Breathing exercises' is partially inferred rather than fully described."
