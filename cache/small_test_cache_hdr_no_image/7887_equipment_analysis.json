  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Climbing Intervals Row,\" and the category includes \"row,\" which strongly indicates that a rowing machine is required for this workout. The description emphasizes building endurance by climbing in rhythm, which is synonymous with rowing machine exercises. The intervals format and the classification under \"sweat\" and \"standard\" further imply high-intensity cardio, typically associated with the use of a rowing machine. Therefore, I assign a very high confidence score of 1.0 to the rowing machine being required."
