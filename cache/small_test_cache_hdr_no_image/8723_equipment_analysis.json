  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is classified under categories that include 'row' and a description indicates it is along the Charles River, suggesting a rowing workout. Furthermore, the format 'Steady' and a specific mention of rhythm (24), which aligns with rowing terminology like strokes per minute, further supports this determination. Although the workout is labeled a 'Cool Down', this typically involves a decreased intensity session using the primary equipment. With high confidence (0.9), a rowing machine is necessary for this workout."
