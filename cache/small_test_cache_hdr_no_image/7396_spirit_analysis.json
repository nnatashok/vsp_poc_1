  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title 'Beginner Whole Body Strength' and category 'On The Mat' suggest a focus on systematic strength training, indicative of the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The description notes participation by joining 'Peter in Siena,' pointing to a guided, methodical session ideal for beginners, aligning with a score of 0.7 for structure. The radio stations, 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits,' along with the inclusive mention of fitness levels, imply some rhythmic components, hence the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a 0.6 score due to potential seamless transitions between exercises. However, the absence of high-paced descriptors in the name or description results in a low score of 0.2 for 'High-Energy & Intense,' as intensity cues are not prominent. Other spirits like 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to the specification 'On The Mat,' indicating an indoor setting. 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Sport & Agility' are not applicable as the workout centers on strength, not recovery or sport-specific skills."
