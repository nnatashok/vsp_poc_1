  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata for the workout 'Post-Row Pilates' suggests a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as indicated by its focus on stretching hips and holding planks. The use of Pilates, a discipline known for gentle, controlled movements and postural emphasis, aligns with restorative qualities. The workout being classified under 'On The Mat' further supports this spirit, indicating a more relaxed and ground-based approach. Additionally, music from 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' radio stations and tracks like 'Mood Ring' and 'All Too Well (Taylor's Version)' imply a soothing atmosphere, enhancing the restorative vibe. A score of 0.8 reflects the strong restorative elements. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant, receiving a score of 0.6, due to the Pilates element, which involves continuous, coordinated movements. However, given the post-workout context and stretching focus, the flow aspect is secondary to the restorative intent. Other spirits were excluded due to the lack of intense, structured, or adventurous features in the workout description."
