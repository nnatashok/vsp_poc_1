  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Go Low Cool-Down' strongly suggests 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, evident from its purpose as a cool-down session focused on control and lowering rhythm, which is typical for workouts aimed at relaxing and refreshing the body after exertion. The mention of 'cool down' and the duration of just under 6 minutes supports this classification with a high score of 0.9. The choice of chill and downtempo music, along with acoustic and soothing songs by artists like Noel and Liam Gallagher and Bob Marley, further aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' by offering a calming and restorative auditory experience. \n\nThe workout also aligns with the 'Zen Flow' vibe, scoring a 0.7, as it emphasizes slowing down and controlling rhythm, which are elements of grounding and intentional movement found in 'Zen Flow'. However, the primary categorization and shorter format better align with 'The Reboot Workout'. The lack of intense physical challenge or ritual elements reduces the likelihood of other vibes."
