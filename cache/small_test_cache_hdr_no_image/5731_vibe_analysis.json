  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Core Flow,' emphasizing a yoga flow focused on core engagement, which suggests a combination of mindfulness and physical activity, aligning with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The setting 'in front of the mountains in Colorado' implies a calm and natural environment, enhancing the grounding, breath-centered nature of a Zen Flow with a strong score of 0.75. The music genre, described as 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo,' further supports this vibe, indicating a relaxing atmosphere, typical of a yoga practice that is unhurried and intentional. Additionally, the classification under 'On The Mat' and the description of prioritizing 'core engagement' resonates well with 'The Meditative Grind' due to the repetitive and focused nature of engaging core muscles during a yoga flow, earning a score of 0.65. The duration of approximately 16 minutes denotes a short but focused session suitable for a methodical grind. Both vibes are suggested with moderate confidence due to clear indications of a calming, rhythmic workout from the metadata, despite the absence of explicit music genre details. The lack of an instructor implies self-guidance, supporting a more meditative, introspective workout vibe."
