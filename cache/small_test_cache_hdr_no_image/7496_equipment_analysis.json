  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, explicitly indicating that a rowing machine is required. Additionally, the workout involves high-intensity intervals with a specific 'max rhythm' of 28, which aligns with rowing exercise metrics, further supporting the need for a rowing machine. The format being HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) and the high-intensity level suggest the use of a rowing machine to achieve the desired workout intensity. Therefore, the confidence level is very high (0.8) that a rowing machine is required for this workout. No other equipment is implied or mentioned in the metadata, leading to the conclusion that a rowing machine is the sole needed equipment."
