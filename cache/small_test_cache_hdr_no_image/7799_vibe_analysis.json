  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified for this workout is 'The Reboot Workout', as the session is designed as a cool-down phase following more intense exercise, focusing on gentle movements to refresh the body. The instructional elements like practicing with eyes closed align with calming, low-stress activities typical of this vibe, earning it a score of 0.75. \n\nAdditionally, the vibe 'The Meditative Grind' fits due to the repetitive and rhythm-focused nature of rowing, especially with the specific mention of rowing with eyes closed. This invites participants into a meditative state, albeit briefly, given the short duration of the workout, resulting in a score of 0.65.\n\n'The Endorphin Wave' is also somewhat relevant, as the music (Country and Global Hits) implies an uplifting element that could enhance the feel-good nature of the session. However, since the workout is primarily a cool-down, this vibe is less pronounced, leading to a lower score of 0.4. The lack of intense or competitive elements excludes vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor'."
