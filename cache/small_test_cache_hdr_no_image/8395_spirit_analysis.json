  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Core Engagement + Stretch Cool-Down' emphasizes a 'steady row' which indicates maintaining a consistent pace, suggesting a Flow & Rhythm spirit, supported by the aim for coordination facilitated by music-driven pacing. The use of 'cool down,' 'stretch,' and phrases like 'incorporate a few pauses to engage your core and stretch your hamstrings' in the description leans heavily towards a Soothing & Restorative spirit, focusing on relaxation and recovery aspects; hence, it has a high score in this category. The format 'steady' and the calm nature of cool-down exercises contribute to the moderate match with Flow & Rhythm at 0.75. The rest of the metadata, including the lack of intense language or environment indicators and the type of music ('Rock low'), does not explicitly support other spirits like High-Energy & Intense or Outdoor & Adventure, further substantiating the selected spirits with a confidence level of 0.7."
