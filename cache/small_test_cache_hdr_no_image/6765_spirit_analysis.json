  "spiritsExplanation": "'Bootcamp HIIT Row' is strongly classified under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit with a score of 0.95 due to its high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format, which inherently demands maximum effort and quick recovery. The workout is set at intensity level 3 out of 3, reinforcing its intense nature. Additionally, the music playlist, dominated by dance and global hits, supports a high-energy atmosphere.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant, with a score of 0.65, as the workout's rhythm is emphasized through short intervals and music-driven pacing, enhancing a coordinated flow experience. Although the primary focus is on intensity, the importance of rhythm is highlighted by the 'Max rhythm: 30'.\n\nThere's a lesser, but notable connection to 'Outdoor & Adventure', with a score of 0.25, since the setting involves navigating Indian Creek. This outdoor element suggests a hint of exploration, though the primary emphasis remains on the intense and rhythmic aspects."
