  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Essential Stretches for Your Back' is clearly a stretching routine, emphasizing the use of a foam roller to target major back muscles. This aligns closely with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which focuses on total-body refreshment and deep stretching. The short duration of 10 minutes and 45 seconds also supports this vibe as it is designed for low-stress, rejuvenating movement, hence the strong match (0.75).\n\nAdditionally, the music consists of upbeat tracks like 'Jubel' and 'This Girl', characterized by lively dance beats. The use of 'Dance Mid' and 'Global Hits' radio stations suggests a more rhythmic and enjoyable atmosphere rather than a purely meditative one, introducing elements of 'The Groove Session' vibe. Although the primary purpose is stretching, the music adds a fluid, fun element reminiscent of groove sessions, resulting in a moderate score (0.5) for this vibe.\n\nThe lack of intensity indicators and the easy fitness level requirement exclude more vigorous vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush'."
