  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Indoor rowing' with a high confidence score of 0.9 because of the explicit mention of 'row' and 'drive' in the category, indicating the workout involves a rowing machine. The description mentions powerful, speedy 5-minute 'pieces,' suggesting structured rowing intervals, which strongly aligns with indoor rowing activities. \n\nAdditionally, the workout has elements of 'HIIT' with a score of 0.6. The structure of 5-minute pieces with a final 1-minute all-out effort indicates a format that requires bursts of high intensity\u2014characteristic of HIIT. The stated intensity level of 3 out of 3 further supports the high-intensity nature of the workout.\n\nThe 'Power' format and the race-like context also imply a focus on intensity and speed, which supports the classification as HIIT as well as rowing. Other categories like 'Treadmill,' 'Elliptical,' or 'Indoor biking' were excluded as there is no mention of respective equipment, nor inferred activities related to those formats."
