  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata strongly suggests the requirement of a rowing machine. The title, 'Go Low Cool-Down', and the description mention 'row' in the Category, indicating an association with rowing activities. The format 'Reverse Climb' and the max rhythm '22' are terms typically associated with rowing workouts, which further implies that a rowing machine is central to the workout. The focus on rhythm control during the workout aligns with the use of a rowing machine. There's no indication of any other equipment being necessary, as the workout primarily seems to focus on using a rowing machine for a cool down exercise. This supports assigning a very high confidence score of 0.9 to the requirement of a rowing machine."
