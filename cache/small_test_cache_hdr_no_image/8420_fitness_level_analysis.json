  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily rowing-based with an 'Interval' format and a max rhythm of 28, suggesting some degree of coordination is required. However, it does not involve complex or technical rowing techniques like those seen in a 'Drive' workout, which keeps the technique difficulty down. The requirement for 'Time Under Tension' and the description mention basic cardio and endurance building, which suits Intermediate users but remains accessible for Beginners due to its non-technical nature.",
