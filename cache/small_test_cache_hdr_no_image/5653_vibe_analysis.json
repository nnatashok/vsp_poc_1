  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'HIIT Strength' clearly suggests a high-intensity interval training session focusing on strength, which aligns strongly with 'The Firestarter' vibe. The playlist features energetic, upbeat tracks from artists like David Guetta and Martin Garrix, typically associated with creating a high-energy atmosphere, further supporting this classification. The short 20-minute duration reinforces the idea of a fast, explosive workout. This combination of high-intensity, short duration, and energetic music gives a strong match for 'The Firestarter' with a score of 0.9. The 'Warrior Workout' also fits due to the emphasis on 'getting your heart rate up,' a common theme for strength and HIIT focusing on primal energy and strength movements. The lack of specification for music genre but reference to dance and global hits suggests a less focused relation to 'The Nightclub Workout,' hence excluded."
