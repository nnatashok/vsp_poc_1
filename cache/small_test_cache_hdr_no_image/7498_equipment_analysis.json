  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is part of a 'Runner's Program' described as involving intervals and is associated with the 'breathe' and 'standard' workout categories, along with 'row,' which strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine. The metadata includes tags like 'breathe,' 'standard,' and 'row,' indicating a rowing-focused cardio session. The structure of intervals, combined with the target rhythm and intensity, further supports the involvement of a rowing machine. Given the context, a high confidence score of 0.8 is assigned because the equipment is central to the workout's nature and explicitly suggested by the metadata."
