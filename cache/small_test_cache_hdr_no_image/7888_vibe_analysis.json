  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Power Flow' workout is characterized by its setting by the water and mountains, suggesting a grounding and calming experience, aligning with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The use of yoga and the optional blocks indicates a breath-centered, intentional workout, which fits well with 'The Zen Flow.' This is reinforced by the unspecified yet ambient music genres 'Chill mid' and 'Cool/Downtempo,' adding a calming, meditative element, thus justifying a score of 0.8.\n\n'Groove Session' is a secondary vibe due to the inclusion of remixes and upbeat tracks such as 'Walking On A Dream' and 'Sway (Chainsmokers Remix).' These elements add a fun, fluid, and expressive quality to the workout, suggesting a moderate match, earning a score of 0.6.\n\nThe workout's outdoor, scenic setting in Vallavik, Norway, introduces elements of 'The Nature Flow,' where the natural environment enhances the experience. This component, combined with the yoga format, results in a moderate association with a score of 0.5 for 'The Nature Flow.'\n\nUncertainty is minimal due to explicit clues about the setting, music, and workout type."
