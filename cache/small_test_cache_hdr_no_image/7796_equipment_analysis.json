  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Climbing Intervals Row' and prominently features terms like 'intervals' and 'climbing,' suggesting an indoor rowing session. The description supports this by mentioning intervals of 3', 2', and 1', which align with a structured rowing workout. Additionally, the workout category explicitly includes 'row,' further confirming rowing machines are essential. This focus and context lead to a very high confidence level (1.0) that a rowing machine is required for effectively performing this workout."
