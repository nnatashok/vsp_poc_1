  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by its short duration focusing on core strength, making it efficient and potentially high-energy due to the music selection. The use of tracks by Ed Sheeran, Disclosure, and Martin Garrix suggests a strong beat-driven and energetic environment, typical of \"The Endorphin Wave,\" which is marked by elevated energy and feel-good movement. Given the dance and global hits music, \"The Rhythmic Powerhouse\" fits due to its emphasis on beat-driven workouts that integrate strong yet fluid movements. Lastly, \"The Groove Session\" is considered due to possible expressive and fun elements implied by the dance music genre. The absence of specific high-intensity or endurance language in the metadata limits the stronger association with more intense or meditative vibes. Confidence is moderately high at 0.75, as the music suggests a certain energy level typical of the selected vibes."
