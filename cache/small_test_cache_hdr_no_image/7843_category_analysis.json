  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Consistency Row' strongly indicates it's an indoor rowing workout given the mention of maintaining a split and sets of intervals. This points towards rowing because 'split' is a common term used in rowing to describe the pace or speed. The metadata also categorizes it as 'row' and mentions a 'Format: Interval,' which supports the classification as Indoor rowing with high confidence, scoring 0.9.\n\nThe workout type includes 'breathe,' and the intensity is specified as 1 out of 3, indicating a focus on steady breathing and potentially low-intensity rowing. This supports the inclusion of 'Breathing exercises' as a secondary category with a score of 0.5. While the music choices, which are rock classics, don't specifically suggest a category, they are often used in rowing workouts to maintain rhythm and intensity.\n\nThe categories of Yoga, Stretching, and Meditation are not applicable as the workout involves rowing intervals and requires maintaining consistent splits, which are not characteristics of those activities."
