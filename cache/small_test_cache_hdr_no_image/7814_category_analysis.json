  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'Indoor rowing' with a high confidence level due to several explicit indicators in the metadata. The term 'row' in the category section, combined with the description emphasizing correct form and a 'gradual climb in rhythm', strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine. Although 'Warm-up' is mentioned in the type, it's explicitly named a 'gradual warm-up', which aligns with preparing for a rowing workout session rather than purely stretching or a warm-up without specific equipment. The inclusion of up-tempo music genres like dance and global hits further supports the classification, as these are often associated with rhythmic and endurance-focused exercises like rowing. Other categories, such as 'Stretching' or 'Mat,' were excluded due to the lack of emphasis on flexibility or bodyweight exercises in the description."
