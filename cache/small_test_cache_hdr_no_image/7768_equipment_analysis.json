  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly centered on rowing as indicated by the title \"Let Go and Row\" and the description containing rowing-related terms like 'Drive' and 'row.' The format is specified as 'Interval,' which is commonly associated with rowing workouts. Additionally, the metadata tags the category as 'Drive,standard,row,' further suggesting the use of a rowing machine. The term 'Max rhythm: 32' likely refers to the strokes per minute in rowing, a standard measure in rowing workouts. The confidence level for the rowing machine is very high at 0.9, as it is clearly central to the workout."
