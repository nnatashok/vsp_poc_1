  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is most accurately classified as 'Indoor rowing' with very high confidence, scoring 0.9. The evidence is strong from the workout name 'Cardio Intervals Row' and the description mentioning 'intervals' and 'shifting in rhythm', which suggests a rowing machine is used. The 'Format: Interval' and 'Max rhythm: 28' align with typical rowing session metrics.\n\nAdditionally, 'HIIT' is also appropriate, scoring 0.7. The use of 'intervals' indicates high-intensity interval training, even though the workout intensity is marked as 2 out of 3, suggesting moderate intensity within a HIIT format. This, combined with the description about elevating heart rate and the rhythmic shifts, supports the HIIT classification.\n\nOther potential categories like 'Mat' or 'Elliptical' are not relevant because the exercise requires a rowing machine, not floor or elliptical equipment. The title and description do not align with Yoga, Pilates, or strength training categories, which focus on different kinds of exercises."
