  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout has been classified under 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 0.9 due to the explicit mention of 'row' in the workout name and category, as well as the description of climbing intervals which are characteristic of rowing machine workouts. Furthermore, the maximum rhythm and format indicate a structured rowing session. Additionally, the 'HIIT' category is included with a score of 0.6 because of the interval format and the use of 'sweat' as a workout type, which implies a high-intensity component typical of HIIT workouts, despite the noted intensity being medium (2 out of 3). Other categories like 'Mat' or 'Elliptical' were not applicable due to the lack of relevant equipment or exercise mentions."
