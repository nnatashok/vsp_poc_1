  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout title 'Yoga Flow' explicitly indicates that the session is a type of yoga, which corresponds with the 'Yoga' category. The description mentions moving through a 'flow', a term commonly associated with yoga practices involving a series of linked movements or poses. This strong indication leads to a high score of 0.9 for the Yoga category, supported by the structured activity and terminology used typical of yoga practices. The 'Category: On The Mat' in the metadata further suggests elements traditionally considered under floor exercises, but since this is particularly a yoga flow, the score for the 'Mat' category is lower at 0.7, indicating a supportive but secondary presence. The music, described as chill and downtempo, aligns well with yoga's often calm and meditative atmosphere, but doesn't influence the category choice directly. Overall, the confidence level is high (0.85) due to clear and explicit markers pointing to the Yoga and Mat categories based on the flow style and mat reference."
