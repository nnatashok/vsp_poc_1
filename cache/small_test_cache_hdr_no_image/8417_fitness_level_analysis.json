Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'strength' and lasts only about 10 minutes, which points to a 'Light' effort difficulty predominantly. The use of resistance bands implies a moderate intensity suitable for low to medium energy expenditure, aligning also with 'Moderate'. The music genre and tempo suggest a pace that might increase exertion slightly but does not elevate it to 'Challenging'. Hence, the primary classification is 'Light'.",
