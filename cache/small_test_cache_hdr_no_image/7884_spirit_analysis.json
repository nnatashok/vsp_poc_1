  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Whole Body Stretch' predominantly aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to its focus on stretching and relaxation with phrases like 'stretch your hips, hamstrings, back, and glutes,' and the serene 'scenery of Norway' adds a calming element, indicating a recovery and relaxation emphasis. This spirit is assigned a high score of 0.9 due to its strong correlation with restorative features. \n\nAdditionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is relevant as the playlist consists of tracks by Kygo, known for smooth, rhythmic melodies, supporting a fluent, uninterrupted movement experience, meriting a score of 0.6 for moderate alignment. \n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is also slightly relevant, scoring 0.5, due to the environmental aspect of 'enjoying the scenery of Norway,' which implies a connection to nature, though the workout is categorized as 'On The Mat,' which restricts this spirit's influence. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Structured & Disciplined,' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded as the workout focuses on stretching rather than intensity, methodical training, or agility."
