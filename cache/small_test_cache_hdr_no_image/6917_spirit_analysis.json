  "spiritsExplanation": "The title 'Yoga Flow' and description 'Move through this flow' strongly suggest the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the emphasis on smooth, continuous movements and coordination. The use of the word 'flow' and the context of yoga practices clearly supports a strong match for this spirit, justifying a high score of 0.85. Additionally, the mention of 'sunny park in Los Angeles' introduces elements of the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, indicating a nature-based component to the workout, although its role is secondary to the flow, leading to a moderate score of 0.6. The 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' music genre and the peaceful, reflective song choices enhance a 'Soothing & Restorative' element aimed at relaxation, resulting in a significant score of 0.65. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the lack of intensity or rigid structure indicators in the workout metadata."
