  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout uses the 'Drive' workout type, classified under Hydrow\u2019s guidelines as Advanced. Additionally, it consists of sprint intervals at a max rhythm of 28 strokes per minute, which requires good rowing form and coordination, typically aligning with an Advanced technique difficulty. Even without specific evidence of movements beyond rowing, this classification remains consistent with the overall intensity and focus on maintaining high effort through intervals.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a workout duration of 21 minutes and intervals involving 90-second sprints interspersed with 30-second max effort pushes, the class is highly demanding. It is assigned an intensity level of 3 out of 3, indicating high energy expenditure and limited rest periods. These factors justify classifying the effort difficulty as Challenging and potentially Extreme for less fit users.",
