  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Cardio Cruise Row', and the description includes the category 'row,' which strongly indicates the need for a rowing machine. The format being 'Interval' within a rowing workout context further supports this, as rowers are commonly used for interval training. The overall theme, focusing on low-intensity rowing ('Cardio Cruise'), suggests the rowing machine is central to the workout. Given these elements, there is very high confidence (0.9) that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
