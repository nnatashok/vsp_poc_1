  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Step by Step Row,\" which suggests a methodical and rhythmic approach, aligning with 'The Meditative Grind.' The description mentions elevating rhythm and intensity with the backdrop of Lake Tahoe, indicating a scenic and steady workout. Additionally, the workout type is listed as 'breathe' and is categorized under 'breathe' and 'row,' reinforcing a focus on rhythmic and controlled breathing, typical of endurance rowing sessions. The music includes Indie Alternative and Global Hits, featuring songs from artists like Grouplove and Walk the Moon, which are upbeat but not overly intense\u2014suitable for maintaining a steady rhythm without rushing the workout. The low intensity level (1 out of 3) further supports the idea of a meditative, endurance-focused session rather than a high-intensity experience. Therefore, 'The Endorphin Wave' is a secondary match due to the steady build and feel-good nature of the music contributing to a pleasant workout experience. Given these elements, the classification confidence is high, primarily due to the explicit focus on rhythm, breathing, and the tranquil setting of Lake Tahoe."
