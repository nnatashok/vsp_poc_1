  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Fix Your Posture' is focused on mobility and is categorized under 'On The Mat' and 'standard, on-the-mat.' The description implies exercises focused on mobility and posture correction, typically done on the floor or a stable surface. This information strongly indicates that a mat is used for comfort and support during such exercises. Additionally, the tag 'On The Mat' explicitly suggests that this workout involves being on the floor, further supporting the use of a mat. Hence, the confidence level for requiring a mat is very high (0.8). No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata, pointing to a bodyweight-based routine, thus no additional equipment is needed apart from a mat."
