  "vibesExplanation": "The given metadata strongly indicates a vibe of 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.8. The key elements include the focus on 'endurance' and 'intervals', typically associated with repetitive actions that promote a meditative flow state. The use of classic rock adds a rhythmic backdrop that supports a steady, focused workout without extreme intensity, which aligns well with this vibe. The workout's duration and moderate intensity further reinforce this classification.\n\nA secondary vibe of 'The Endorphin Wave' with a score of 0.7 is also applicable. The playlist of classic rock songs like those by Aerosmith and Sammy Hagar suggests a feel-good, upbeat energy, encouraging participants to enjoy the endurance process, resulting in an energized state typical of 'The Endorphin Wave'. The metadata indicates a low-intensity level which might not fully embody 'The Endorphin Wave', therefore, receiving a slightly lower score.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush' are excluded due to the low intensity and endurance focus, and 'The Nightclub Workout' is not supported by the classic rock music selection."
