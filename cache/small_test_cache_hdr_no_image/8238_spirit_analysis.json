  "spiritsExplanation": "The title 'Technique Cool-Down' and the description stating 'Focus on your technique while cooling down' strongly suggest a focus on relaxation and recovery, indicative of the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, which I assigned a score of 0.8 due to the explicit mention of cooling down. The workout calls for attention to 'technique', which aligns with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.7, as it indicates a methodical approach to movement, especially with the specified steady rhythm of 22 strokes per minute. The use of live rock music in the playlist, while not typically calming, could support a sense of 'Flow & Rhythm', hence it scores 0.6 as it might help maintain a smooth rowing cadence. The short duration and emphasis on technique over intensity exclude 'High-Energy & Intense'. There are no indicators of 'Sport & Agility' or 'Outdoor & Adventure', hence they were not considered relevant."
