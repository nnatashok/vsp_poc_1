  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit for this workout is 'Flow & Rhythm', indicated by the title 'Power Flow' and workout type 'flow', suggesting a smooth, continuous movement sequence that is likely synchronized with music and focused on the mind-body connection, earning a score of 0.9. The description mentions the setting 'overlooking the water and mountains in Vallavik, Norway,' which introduces elements of the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, suggesting an appreciation of natural surroundings, scoring 0.7. The music playlist includes chill and downtempo tracks, which alongside the yoga setting, contributes to a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit as it promotes relaxation and stress reduction; however, the workout's focus on 'power flow' suggests it's not purely restorative, thus earning a moderate score of 0.6. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are less likely due to the absence of high-intensity or methodical indicators."
