  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's title and description emphasize an outdoor and adventurous spirit, as it takes place on Lake Tahoe and involves 'climbing at altitude.' The use of a 'rock playlist' suggests an energetic environment, which aligns with the High-Energy & Intense spirit. The max rhythm of 26 and the 'sweat' workout type also support this, indicating moderate intensity designed to push the limits. \n\nFlow & Rhythm is a fitting spirit due to the mention of 'jamming out' to music, suggesting a focus on coordinating movement with rhythm, supported by the rock songs known for their upbeat and driving tempos. The Outdoor & Adventure spirit is evident from the setting on Lake Tahoe and the format being a 'climb,' indicating exploration and environmental engagement. \n\nThe overall intensity level is intermediate (2 out of 3), which confirms a dynamic and engaging workout rather than a purely high-intensity or rhythm-focused session, leading to slightly lower but clearly significant scores for both High-Energy & Intense and Flow & Rhythm. Structured & Disciplined and Soothing & Restorative are excluded due to lack of mentions of technical precision or recovery focus."
