  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout name 'Technique Cool-Down' and the description emphasize focusing on technique, suggesting this is not a high-intensity session. The metadata categorizes this as a 'row' workout, which highly indicates the use of a 'rowing machine'. The confidence score is 0.9 because this equipment is central to the workout, being a cool-down for a rowing session, which implies ending exercise on what was previously used. Although there is no explicit mention of a rowing machine, the categorization and context of focus on rowing technique during a cool-down strongly suggest its necessity."
