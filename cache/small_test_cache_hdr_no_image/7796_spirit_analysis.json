  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Climbing Intervals Row' features a 'climb' format with intervals of 3', 2', and 1', indicating a methodical and structured approach to training. This aligns with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, as it involves following specific guidelines and progression, particularly with the climb from 22 to 26 in rhythmic beats (score: 0.7). Despite the relatively low intensity level (1 out of 3), the presence of intervals suggests a level of technical precision and adherence to form.\n\nAdditionally, the music playlist incorporates various soul, funk, and disco elements, which tend to emphasize a sense of flow and rhythm. The music could drive smooth, continuous rowing motions, supporting a 'Flow & Rhythm' classification (score: 0.75). The choice of soulful and upbeat global hits could produce an engaging, rhythmic exercise atmosphere.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is less applicable here despite the low intensity and beginner-friendly design because the focus on interval training suggests a more structured approach than a purely restorative one."
