  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Positioning Row' with a focus on technique and form ('bring your stroke back to basics', 'focus on core over positioning') aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to the repetitive and mastery-focused nature of rowing training, especially at a beginner level. The duration (16 minutes) and the 'breathe' classification suggest a steady, controlled approach, characteristic of both 'The Meditative Grind' and 'The Zen Flow'. The low intensity (1 out of 3) and music selection with calming yet vibrant country and global hits like Dolly Parton and Brandi Carlile contribute to a relaxing and grounding experience, further supporting 'The Zen Flow'. 'The Comfort Moves' also fits moderately due to the beginner-focused session that emphasizes comfort and steady practice ('standard, breathe, row'). Lack of a high intensity or explosive elements means vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded. Confidence is high given the clear methodical and calming cues in the metadata."
