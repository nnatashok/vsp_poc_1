  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a short duration of approximately 16 minutes and is categorized under 'On The Mat'. The description lacks intensity cues like 'challenging' or 'intense', indicating that it is likely not highly demanding. The music listed (Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo) suggests a relaxed pace. The focus on core engagement is likely to elevate this beyond a purely light workout but not significantly so, as flows tend to be moderately paced. Hence, it aligns mostly with Light, with some elements of Moderate effort difficulty.",
