  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Beginner Yoga Flow' is characterized primarily by its focus on smooth, continuous movement, indicated by the term \"flow\" in both the title and description. This aligns well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, and the choice of relaxing music (chill/downtempo) supports this classification with a strong score of 0.9. The peaceful setting overlooking Achill Island, mentioned in the description, contributes to a 'Soothing & Restorative' atmosphere, enhanced by the scenic outdoor location, garnering a score of 0.8. Additionally, the outdoor setting in a natural environment suggests elements of 'Outdoor & Adventure', though to a lesser extent since the primary focus is on the yoga flow, thus it is scored at 0.7. The brief duration and beginner-friendly nature further emphasize the calming and accessible aspects of this workout, excluding more intense or structured spirits."
