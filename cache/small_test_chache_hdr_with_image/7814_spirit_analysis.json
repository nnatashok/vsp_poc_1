  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Gradual Warm-Up' is characterized by a gradual build-up in rhythm, emphasizing coordination and fluid movement, which aligns well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The music playlist, featuring energetic tracks, supports this flow-oriented experience, warranting a score of 0.65. Meanwhile, the mention of 'correct form' and 'interval format' indicates a methodical approach, suggesting elements of the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. This structured nature provides a score of 0.6. Additionally, being a warm-up session designed for all fitness levels, it has some aspects of the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, focusing on being gentle and preparatory, which earns it a score of 0.4. The inclusion of varied music genres and fitness levels broadens its appeal, but the primary focus remains on rhythm and structure rather than intense intensity or restorative focus."
