  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. The workout name 'Gradual Warm-Up' and description mentioning a gradual climb in rhythm align with activities typically performed on a rowing machine. Additionally, the interval format and maximum rhythm suggest a structured cardiovascular exercise common with rowing equipment. The confidence level is high (0.9) because rowing is explicitly mentioned as part of the workout category, making a rowing machine essential for this session."
