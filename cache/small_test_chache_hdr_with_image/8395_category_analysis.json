  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Indoor rowing' with a high confidence score of 0.9 because the description explicitly mentions rowing with a steady rhythm. The image further supports this as it's performed on a rowing boat. The secondary category is 'Stretching', scored at 0.6, due to the inclusion of pauses to stretch the hamstrings, indicating a focus on flexibility. The title 'Core Engagement + Stretch Cool-Down' emphasizes these components together, which justifies the inclusion of stretching exercises. The context of a cool-down also points towards lighter, flexibility-focused movements after rowing."
