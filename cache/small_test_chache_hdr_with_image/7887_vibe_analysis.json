  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe classification leans towards 'The Meditative Grind' and 'The Endorphin Wave'. The rowing workout's title 'Climbing Intervals Row' indicates a focus on endurance and rhythm, suggesting a meditative flow common in rowing. The description supports this by highlighting the endurance build-up with increasing rhythm. These elements are core aspects of the 'Meditative Grind'. The vibe is reinforced by the workout's structure - interval format and continuous climbing, fitting into a steady, repetitive and challenging session, which is typical for this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is appropriate given the mid-level intensity and the playlist featuring hip hop and R&B, which can energize and elevate mood, aligning with this vibe's characteristics. The 31-minute duration suggests a sustained energy build-up, common in an 'Endorphin Wave' setting. Thus, 'The Endorphin Wave' complements the primary 'Meditative Grind' vibe, creating a balanced experience between endurance and uplifting energy."
