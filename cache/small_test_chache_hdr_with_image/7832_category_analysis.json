  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout \"Hip-Opening Flow\" is classified primarily under \"Yoga\" due to the description emphasizing hip-opening, mindfulness, and body awareness, all of which are commonly associated with yoga practices. The term \"flow\" is often used in yoga, indicating a sequence of movements. The tranquil and scenic outdoor setting further suggests a yoga session aimed at relaxation and connection with nature, which aligns with the \"Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo\" music genre as background.\n\nThe category \"Stretching\" is also relevant, as the focus on opening the hips involves various stretching exercises. The presence of a mat and yoga blocks in the image suggests flexibility and mobility work, supporting this classification.\n\nScores are assigned with high confidence for Yoga (0.9) given the strong indicators, and moderate confidence for Stretching (0.7), acknowledging that flexibility is a significant component but secondary to the overall theme of yoga."
