  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Go Low Cool-Down' is primarily characterized by a slow, controlled rhythm signified by the titles 'cool down' and 'how low can you go,' along with a maximum rhythm of 22 strokes per minute, suggesting a meditative, repetitive focus typical of 'The Meditative Grind.' Its short duration (5 minutes 44 seconds) and the reverse climb format further reinforce this vibe. The music selections, such as 'Wonderwall (Live For Rhapsody),' with the chill, downtempo playlist, align with a calming, meditative experience. A score of 0.8 reflects the strong match.\n\nAdditionally, the description highlights a restorative, cooling-down aspect, which aligns with 'The Reboot Workout.' The music and the gentle pace aim for a refreshing experience, designed to lower intensity and stress after prior exertion, earning a score of 0.6 for this vibe. The combination of these elements makes the chosen vibes fitting with strong confidence as the metadata lacks competitive or high-energy indicators."
