  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout title 'Welcome to Norway Flow' and description emphasize a 'core-focused flow,' hinting at a mat-based activity possibly involving yoga or Pilates movements. The categorization of 'On The Mat' further supports this inference, suggesting exercises performed on a mat, leaning towards general mat work. The serene environment and 'Chill' music imply a calming, flowing routine, commonly associated with yoga practices, hence a strong score for 'Yoga.' 'Pilates' is considered due to the core focus, although it is less explicitly indicated in the metadata. Overall, strong indicators for 'Mat' and 'Yoga,' with moderate confidence in 'Pilates.'"
