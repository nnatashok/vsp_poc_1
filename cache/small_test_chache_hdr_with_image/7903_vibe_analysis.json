  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Climbing Intervals Row' is characterized by climbing intervals, rhythm, and endurance aspects, leading to the selection of 'The Endorphin Wave' and 'The Meditative Grind' vibes. The Endorphin Wave vibe was selected with a score of 0.75 due to the gradual build-up in intensity ('climbing') and the music choice featuring popular, uplifting pop hits by Ed Sheeran, which aligns with a feel-good, elevated energy experience. The Meditative Grind vibe receives a score of 0.6 due to the repetitive and endurance-focused nature of rowing workouts implied by 'three 4-minute intervals' and 'climbing in rhythm.' The absence of extremely intense language or very high-intensity levels suggests this isn't a hyper-intense workout, reinforcing these two vibes over more explosive or high-octane options."
