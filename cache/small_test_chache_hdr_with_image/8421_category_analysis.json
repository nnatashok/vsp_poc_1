  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Core Flow', which strongly indicates a Yoga practice due to the use of the term \"flow,\" commonly associated with Vinyasa or flow yoga. The description emphasizes 'heat-building' and 'core', suggesting a yoga session focused on strengthening the core. The recommendation of a yoga block as equipment further solidifies this classification as yoga. \n\nThe category 'Mat' is also highly relevant here, with a score of 0.85, as the workout is described as 'on the mat', with no mention of additional equipment besides the block. The image provided shows an individual in a position typical for a yoga practice on a mat outdoors. \n\nThe use of chill music also supports a yoga or mat-based workout ambiance. Other categories, like Pilates or Body weight, are not as relevant here due to the lack of specific terminology or movement descriptions related to those exercises. The overall confidence is high due to clear descriptors in the metadata."
