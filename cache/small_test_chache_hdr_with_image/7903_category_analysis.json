  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"Outdoor rowing\" due to the visual evidence of rowing taking place on water, as seen in the provided image. The title 'Climbing Intervals Row' and description of 'three 4-minute intervals' suggest a structured training session with changing intensity, characteristic of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which is supported by the mention of 'climbing in rhythm and intensity.' The workout's intensity level of 2 out of 3 and the term \"sweat\" imply a significant physical effort, further reinforcing the HIIT classification. Although the environment is outdoors, typical indicators of intensity in interval training justify the dual classification. The exercise primarily involves rowing on water, making 'Outdoor rowing' the dominant category, while the interval structure gives moderate confidence to HIIT also being relevant."
