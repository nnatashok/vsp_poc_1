  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Endurance Builder Row' is classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.7. This choice is supported by the phrase 'set to a classic rock playlist,' which suggests a music-driven flow suitable for maintaining rhythm and coordination during rowing. Furthermore, the rock music selection aligns with creating an engaging and rhythmic workout atmosphere. \n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is assigned a score of 0.6. The description mentions 'a series of intervals,' indicating a methodical approach to building endurance through planned, paced efforts. \n\nFinally, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is given a score of 0.5 due to the inclusion of an outdoor rowing image, which implies an element of exploration and nature-based environment. Although the workout is categorized under 'Breathe,' which might suggest a calming focus, the intervals and rhythmic music somewhat diminish this possibility, thus not assigning the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit."
