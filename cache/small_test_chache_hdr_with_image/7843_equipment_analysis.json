  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Consistency Row' and category 'row' strongly indicate the need for a rowing machine. The description references maintaining a consistent split during intervals, which is characteristic of rowing workouts. The image further supports this, showing rowing equipment outdoors. Given these factors, there is very high confidence that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
