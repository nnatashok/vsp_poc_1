  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Power Flow,\" indicating a focus on smooth, continuous movements typical of the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit. This is reinforced by the term \"flow\" highlighted in the workout type. The music playlist, featuring chill and downtempo tracks, further supports this spirit by setting a rhythmic and coordinated atmosphere. The high score of 0.9 reflects these strong indicators.\n\nThe location in Vallavik, Norway, overlooking water and mountains, introduces an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" element. The natural setting suggests an exploration and engagement with the environment, assigning a score of 0.7 due to its significant but secondary influence.\n\nThe calm music genre and optional use of yoga blocks indicate some \"Soothing & Restorative\" aspects, allowing for relaxation and stress reduction. This is scored 0.5 as the primary focus is on flow instead of purely restorative practices. Overall, these spirits capture the essential qualities of the workout based on the metadata provided."
