  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is characterized by \"3' intervals at low rhythms,\" indicating a focus on steady, continuous movement, aligning well with the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit. The choice of music from diverse energetic genres like \"Dance mid, Global Hits\" supports the rhythmic aspect, earning a strong score of 0.8.\n\nThe description mentions \"Build your aerobic base\" and \"Workout intensity level: 1 out of 3,\" suggesting a gentle, restorative approach. This aligns with \"Soothing & Restorative,\" though less prominently, warranting a score of 0.6.\n\nLastly, the structured intervals suggest an element of \"Structured & Disciplined\" training, though the low intensity and focus on breathing make it a less fitting spirit, resulting in a moderate score of 0.4. The \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is excluded as there is no explicit mention of outdoor elements, despite the rowing image which might suggest an outdoor setting."
