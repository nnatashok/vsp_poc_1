  "vibesExplanation": "The chosen vibes for 'Welcome to Norway Flow' align closely with the serene and fluid nature mentioned in the workout description. 'The Zen Flow' (score: 0.9) is strongly represented by the words 'serene surroundings' and 'flow,' suggesting a calming, breath-centered workout amidst the tranquil landscapes of Norway. Additionally, the Chill mid and Cool/Downtempo music genres further support this vibe by promoting a relaxed and meditative atmosphere.\n\n'The Groove Session' (score: 0.7) also fits well due to the core-focused flow and music selection, including tracks by artists like R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL, known for their rhythmic and fluid beats that enhance expressive movement. The workout's structure, on a mat, indicates a fun and engaging session, although the dominant chilled-out feel of the setting and music makes 'The Zen Flow' more prominent.\n\nAlternative vibes such as 'The Meditative Grind' were considered but excluded due to the emphasis on core focus rather than endurance or repetition."
