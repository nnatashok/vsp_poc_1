  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves standard rowing movements, described as 'breathe' in the metadata. This suggests a focus on form and rhythm rather than complex techniques. Given the 'Beginner' user fitness level requirement, the technique is straightforward. However, the mention of controlling effort and rhythm variability suggests some coordination is needed, aligning moderately with an Intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts 16 minutes and is classified with an intensity level of 1 out of 3. This indicates a low-intensity session. The interval format with variable rhythm control may add slight physical demand, but overall, it aligns more closely with a Light difficulty level. There is some alignment with Moderate due to the interval nature, but the primary intensity cues suggest 'Light' effort.",
