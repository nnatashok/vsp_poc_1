  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Running Up the Hill Row\" includes four phases of HIIT intervals, indicating a high-intensity focus, which aligns it strongly with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. This is further supported by a max rhythm of 30 and an intensity level of 3 out of 3. The usage of 80's and Global Hits, especially the iconic 'Running Up That Hill,' suggests a drive in rhythm that aligns moderately with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the music's role in pacing the workout. The advanced fitness level requirement also supports the emphasis on intensity. Other spirits were excluded due to the specific HIIT format and the lack of restorative or outdoor elements in the description."
