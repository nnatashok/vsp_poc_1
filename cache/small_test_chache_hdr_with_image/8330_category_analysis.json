  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Twists Flow' suggests a flowing sequence, which is commonly associated with Yoga. The description indicates opening shoulders, chest, and back, typical of Yoga poses involving twisting. The term 'flow' and the emphasis on specific body areas support this categorization, leading to a high confidence score for Yoga (0.8). The category 'On The Mat' also suggests Yoga, Pilates, or similar workouts, reinforced by the use of a mat in the image. Furthermore, the absence of specified equipment and focus on body positioning and flexibility correlates with Mat exercises, justifying a strong score for Mat (0.7). The relaxing music playlist featuring chill and downtempo tracks aligns well with the typical ambiance of a Yoga session, further supporting this classification. Other categories like Pilates or Stretching were considered but are less fitting given the descriptors used."
