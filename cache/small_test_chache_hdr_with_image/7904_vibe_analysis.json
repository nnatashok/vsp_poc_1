  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled \"Step by Step Row\" is set in the scenic location of Lake Tahoe, suggesting a meditative and calming atmosphere. The moderate rhythm of 24 and focus on rhythm and intensity points to a structured workout, aligning with \"The Meditative Grind.\" The mention of \"breathe\" and a low intensity (1 out of 3) further supports a Zen-like, intentional flow, hence \"The Zen Flow.\" The \"Climb\" format, combined with upbeat indie and global hits music, introduces an element of energy and uplift, slightly suggesting \"The Endorphin Wave.\" The scoring reflects strong elements of a meditative, rhythmic emphasis, with a lesser match for an energetic build."
