  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Endurance Intervals Row' suggests a steady, rhythmic focus, typical of 'The Meditative Grind,' characterized by repetition and endurance in rowing. The duration of 16 minutes and the mention of 'climbing intervals' support a grinding yet engaging experience. The rock and global hits music, such as 'Rock And Roll All Nite' by Kiss, adds an energetic element, signifying 'The Endorphin Wave,' which combines elevated energy with feel-good movement. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 aligns with both vibes, suggesting a demanding but not overwhelming workout. The lack of a specific instructor-led experience reduces the competitiveness, deviating from a vibe like 'The Competitor.' Overall, these elements contribute to moderate confidence in these vibes."
