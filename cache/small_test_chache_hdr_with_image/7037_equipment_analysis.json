  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'On The Mat' and is intended for stretching. This strongly suggests that a mat is needed for floor-based exercises, particularly when focusing on stretching hip flexors and adductors, as mentioned in the description. The confidence score is very high due to the explicit mention and categorization involving a mat."
