  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Endurance Intervals Row' primarily embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as indicated by the description of 'climbing intervals' and a music playlist filled with energetic rock hits. The intervals and high max rhythm suggest a challenging, invigorating session, with a confidence of 0.7.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also present due to the structured format of 2-minute intervals and the methodical approach consistent with interval training. The focus on endurance and interval timing suggests this spirit, earning a score of 0.6.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' appears to a lesser extent, supported by the mention of rhythm and music styling. However, without specific emphasis on musical pacing, this spirit is given a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to lack of indicators for recovery, sports-specific skills, or outdoor elements, reflecting an overall confidence of 0.85 in the analysis."
