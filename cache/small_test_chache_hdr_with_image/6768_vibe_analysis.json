  "vibesExplanation": "In analyzing the metadata for the 'Essential Stretches for Your Back' workout, two primary vibes are identified: **The Reboot Workout** and **The Groove Session**.\n\n**The Reboot Workout** vibe is strongly present, scoring 0.75, due to the focus on stretching and the use of foam rollers, which align with the idea of a low-stress, total-body refresh. The short duration and emphasis on stretching suggest a deep stretch and refresh theme, common in reboot workout vibes.\n\n**The Groove Session** scores 0.5, highlighting the fun and rhythmic aspect of the workout. The playlist including songs like 'Jubel' and 'This Girl' suggests a light, enjoyable atmosphere, even during a mat-based stretching session. The upbeat and popular music tracks align with a fluid and expressive vibe.\n\nThese two vibes capture the essence of the workout\u2019s atmosphere and intentions, offering a balanced experience of relaxation and enjoyment, despite the primary focus on stretching."
