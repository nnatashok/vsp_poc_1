  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Advanced HIIT Row' strongly suggests a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format, which is typically fast-paced and requires maximum effort. This aligns with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, supported by the 'max rhythm: 32' and 'workout intensity level: 3 out of 3,' indicating a very energetic session. The description mentions reaching 'high rhythms at maximum effort' and listening to a playlist of influential female artists, which can be motivating during intense workouts. The playlist features upbeat and powerful songs, enhancing the energetic vibe.\n\nThe 'Sport & Agility' spirit is also applicable, as the session focuses on rowing, a sports-specific activity. Rowing requires agility, coordination, and athletic performance, especially at an advanced level. The mention of 'drive' and 'standard row' further emphasizes a structured, athletic routine.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are less relevant here due to the explicit emphasis on intensity and athletic performance, rather than smooth or relaxing elements. The confidence level is high (0.85) due to clear indicators of these spirits in the metadata."
