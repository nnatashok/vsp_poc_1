  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Post-Row Align Yoga' workout is classified primarily as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.8. This is due to its focus on recovery and relaxation, as reflected in the description emphasizing hip, hamstring, and spine movement designed for post-row recovery, and the 'align' type. The music choice with chill and downtempo tracks further supports a restful atmosphere, aligning with restorative practices.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.7, as yoga typically involves smooth, rhythmic movements and a focus on a mind-body connection. The playlist features remixes and chill tracks that align well with maintaining a flowing session.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' was considered due to the outdoor setting visible in the image, contributing to a mild sense of adventure or exploration, scoring 0.5. Other spirits were excluded due to the lack of typical high-energy, structured training elements or sport-specific skills."
