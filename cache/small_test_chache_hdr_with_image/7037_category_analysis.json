  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Post-Row Stretch' is primarily focused on stretching, as explicitly stated in both the title and description. The focus on stretching specific muscle groups like hip flexors and adductors strongly supports the classification as 'Stretching' with a very high confidence score of 0.9. The mention of 'On The Mat' in the category indicates that the exercises are performed on a mat, further justifying the inclusion of the 'Mat' category with a moderate score of 0.7. The short duration and focus on recovery after rowing exclude high-intensity categories such as HIIT or Weight workout. The outdoor snowy setting seen in the image does not affect the classification, given the description's emphasis on stretching activities typically performed indoors on mats."
