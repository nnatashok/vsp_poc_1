  "categoriesExplanation": "The 'Steady State Row' is clearly categorized under 'Indoor rowing,' supported by the explicit mention of rowing at rhythms 22 and 24, focused on building a cardio base. Even though the image shows outdoor rowing, the description implies it\u2019s a steady rowing session suitable for indoor replication. This is supported by the use of music typically used in indoor workouts.\n\nThe inclusion of 'breathe' and 'Workout Type: breathe' suggests a potential element of 'Breathing exercises,' but it is a secondary aspect compared to the rowing focus. Hence, a lower score is assigned for breathing exercises due to its less dominant role in the workout duration.\n\nThe workout intensity level of 1 out of 3 and the playlist with pop hits imply a relaxed atmosphere consistent with steady-state cardio rowing rather than high-intensity training. Potential confusion with outdoor rowing is clarified by the indoor applicability, focusing more on the structured rowing rhythm."
