  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 15 minutes long and is focused on stretching, indicating a very low energy expenditure. It is suitable as a recovery or cooldown activity, aligning strongly with a Light effort difficulty. The presence of radio station music with a dance genre adds a slight hint of rhythm that might encourage slightly more intensity, but not enough to surpass a Moderate level.",
