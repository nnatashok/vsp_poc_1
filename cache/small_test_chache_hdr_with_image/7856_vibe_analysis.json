  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled \"Comeback Row\" emphasizes a gradual build in rhythm, which aligns well with \"The Meditative Grind\" due to its focus on repetition and endurance. The rowing format and the steady climactic nature suggest a rhythmic endurance experience, and the moderate score reflects this association. The concept of making a 'comeback' contributes to an \"Endorphin Wave\" vibe, as it suggests a feel-good energy and progressive build. The choice of indie and global hits in the playlist fosters a positive, uplifting atmosphere, adding to this vibe. Lastly, the \"Reboot Workout\" is applicable due to the low-intensity level and focus on rebuilding fitness, signaling a gentle, refreshing exercise session. Each vibe is selected based on the descriptive elements and the music's influence on the workout experience."
