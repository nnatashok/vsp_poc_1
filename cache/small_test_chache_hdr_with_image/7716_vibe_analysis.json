  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Rhythm 30 HIIT Row' workout exhibits characteristics of 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its HIIT format, which is fast, explosive, and focused on high-intensity bursts. The description emphasizes 'max pressure' and high rhythm intervals, indicating a high-intensity workout typical of firestarter sessions. The advanced fitness level and intensity level 3 of 3 further support this.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe is present due to the rhythmic, endurance-based element of a rowing HIIT workout. The steady build of one-minute intense intervals followed by recovery can generate a strong endorphin response. The playlist, featuring energized pop and rock hits, can enhance this feel-good, elevated energy.\n\nConfidence is high due to explicit details about intensity and music style, but some uncertainty exists without precise music genre specification, which slightly affects the vibe scoring."
