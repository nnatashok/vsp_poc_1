  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Climbing Intervals Row\" suggests a rhythmic component with intervals and rhythm shift each minute, aligning it with a \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit. The use of Latin and Global Hits music further supports this spirit by emphasizing musical pacing and connection. The climbing format and focus on technique indicate a \"Structured & Disciplined\" approach due to the methodical progress and technical focus required. This structured training is reinforced by the 'climb' and 'focus on technique' described in the workout metadata. The mention of intervals and a maximum rhythm hints at a \"High-Energy & Intense\" component, though with moderate confidence due to the intensity being level 2 out of 3, indicating a balanced but energetic session. The outdoor setting seen in the image adds context but does not strongly affect the primary spirits identified."
