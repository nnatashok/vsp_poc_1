  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Pure Energy Row' strongly embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, evidenced by the metadata featuring \"high-intensity intervals,\" the highest \"workout intensity level\" of 3 out of 3, and the inclusion of a \"HIIT\" format. The music playlist with upbeat and energetic tracks like 'Give Me Everything' by Pitbull and others further underscores this intensity, earning a high confidence score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, there are elements of 'Sport & Agility,' as the workout involves rowing along the Charles River, which implies a sport-like scenario involving coordination and agility, giving this spirit a moderate confidence score of 0.6. The advanced fitness level requirement reinforces the athletic nature of the workout.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the lack of specific focus on coordination or methodical structuring beyond the typical HIIT format."
