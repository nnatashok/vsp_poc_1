Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a short duration of just over 5 minutes and a focus on warm-up, the physical demand is minimal. Keywords such as 'prepare your body' and 'warm-up' support the 'Light' classification. The presence of music with energetic genres could suggest slightly increased energy, giving a weak argument for 'Moderate'.",
