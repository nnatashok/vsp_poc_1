  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout 'Pause Drill Cool-Down' is explicitly focused on rowing technique, reinforced by pause drills. The description mentions the Connecticut River, indicating a rowing setting, confirmed by the image of rowing outdoors. Although 'cool down' suggests a lower intensity, the focus on rowing technique places it in the 'Indoor rowing' category, even if outdoors. This is reinforced by the metadata terms 'standard' and 'row,' leading to a strong score of 0.9.\n\nWhile the activity is a cool down, it involves reinforcing technique rather than mere stretching, but 'Stretching' is included with a score of 0.6 due to the focus on slowing down and form. Other categories, such as 'Meditation' and 'Yoga,' were excluded as there is no evidence suggesting mindfulness practices or postures characteristic of these categories."
