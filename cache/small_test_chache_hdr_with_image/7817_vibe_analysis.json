  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled \"80's Fun Summer Row\" features 80's music, which is often upbeat and energizing, lending itself to 'The Groove Session' vibe. The title emphasizes relaxation and fun, while the music playlist with songs like 'You Give Love A Bad Name' and 'Sweet Dreams' supports a feel-good, rhythmic experience, perfectly matching 'The Groove Session' with a score of 0.9.\n\nThe structure, involving intervals and a 31-minute duration, aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' as it involves repetition and focus, though less intense than traditional endurance training. The score for this vibe is 0.7, indicating a good fit with the workout's interval nature.\n\nAdditionally, the beat-driven nature of the 80's hits aligns with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse'. Although not its primary function, the workout does feature strong beat-driven elements that enhance the rhythmic rowing experience, justifying a score of 0.6.\n\nOverall, the workout is more about enjoying the music and rhythm rather than extreme physical output, which is why vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' and 'The Endorphin Wave' were not chosen."
