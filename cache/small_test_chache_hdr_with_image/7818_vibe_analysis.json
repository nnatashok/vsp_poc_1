  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is a strong match for 'The Meditative Grind' given its structured and repetitive nature. The metadata indicates a steady, rhythmic rowing session, emphasizing arm, core, and leg engagement in 5-minute segments, which aligns with the meditative and focused aspects of this vibe. The maximum rhythm of 22 and emphasis on 'steady' pace suggest a controlled, endurance-driven workout.\n\nThe music selection, featuring indie and alternative segments, supports a mellow, introspective atmosphere, further reinforcing the idea of a meditative and focused workout. \n\nSecondly, 'The Zen Flow' is a suitable secondary vibe due to the workout's low intensity level (1 out of 3) and description as 'breathe,' which are indicative of a calming and intentional pace, typical of Zen-centered exercises. The presence of calming and contemporary tracks also contributes to a soothing flow experience.\n\nThere is high confidence in these classifications as the workout description and metadata closely align with these vibes, creating a well-defined emotional quality for the session."
