  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is clearly a \"Stretching\" session, as indicated by both the title \"Essential Stretches for Your Back\" and the description, which explicitly mentions using a foam roller to stretch the back muscles. The metadata includes the workout type as \"stretching\" and the category as \"On The Mat,\" further supporting that this workout involves flexibility training. The score of 0.95 for \"Stretching\" reflects very high confidence due to these strong indicators.\n\nThe category \"Mat\" is also relevant since the workout is performed on an exercise mat, which is shown in the image and supported by the category label \"On The Mat.\" This justifies assigning a score of 0.8 to \"Mat,\" a strong presence due to the combination of stretching exercises performed on a mat.\n\nOther categories such as \"Yoga\" or \"Pilates\" were not considered because there's no indication of yoga postures or the controlled movements characteristic of Pilates."
