  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Steady Adventure Row' suggests an emphasis on maintaining a consistent pace, which aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The descriptor 'steady' and 'maintaining a consistent split' indicate a focus on smooth, rhythmic rowing with a potential rhythmic music backdrop. The playlist includes dance and global hits, which likely contributes to maintaining a rhythmic flow, warranting a 0.75 score for 'Flow & Rhythm'.\n\nThe image of rowing on a body of water and the word 'Adventure' in the title suggest an element of exploration and connection with nature, characteristic of 'Outdoor & Adventure'. This spirit is supported with a score of 0.6 since the activity visually takes place outdoors, though the metadata doesn't emphasize exploration explicitly.\n\nFinally, the workout intensity is rated 1 out of 3, focusing on 'breathe', indicating a lower intensity session. This supports the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit to a moderate degree, giving it a 0.4 score as it contains elements of calmness and controlled breathing, though not explicitly restorative focus."
