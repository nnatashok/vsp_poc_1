  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as a 'cool down' and focuses on technique, which often involves low intensity and relaxation. The presence of phrases like 'cooling down' and 'technique' suggests a relaxing session after a more intense workout. The prominent use of a rowing machine, as evidenced by the image and the term 'standard,row,' categorizes this as 'Indoor rowing' with high confidence (0.9). Though performed outdoors, the focus aligns with typical indoor rowing activities.\n\nGiven the nature of cool-down activities, which often involve light stretching and relaxation to reduce heart rate and prevent injury, 'Stretching' is included with moderate confidence (0.5). The lack of explicit stretching indicators in the metadata lowers the certainty for a higher score. Other categories like 'HIIT' or 'Strength' are excluded due to the described low intensity."
