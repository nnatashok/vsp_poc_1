  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Steady Adventure Row,\" and focuses on maintaining a consistent pace across intervals, indicating rowing is a central activity. The metadata categorically mentions \"row,\" aligning strongly with rowing as the primary exercise. However, the image shows outdoor rowing instead of a machine, indicating this specific workout is done in water. Thus, equipment classified as \"Other\" (outdoor rowing setup) is necessary, with a confidence score of 0.8."
