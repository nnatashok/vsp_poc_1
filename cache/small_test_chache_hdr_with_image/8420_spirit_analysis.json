  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Time Under Tension Row' demonstrates an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit through the explicit mention of rowing intervals 'along the Charles River,' which suggests an outdoor, exploration-based activity. This element is key, earning a high score of 0.8.\\n\\n'High-Energy & Intense' is attributed based on the nature of interval training combined with the 'sweat' category and a workout intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicating significant exertion levels, giving it a score of 0.7. The inclusion of 'intervals' also hints at bursts of higher exertion.\\n\\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is supported by the smooth continuous rowing in harmony with music, particularly through the 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits' genres. 'Max rhythm: 28' indirectly conveys a pacing element, leading to a score of 0.6.\\n\\n'Structured & Disciplined' could have been a consideration given the interval format, but the emphasis on outdoor adventure and cardio endurance building, along with rhythmic elements, makes other spirits more fitting. The confidence in this analysis is relatively high due to multiple clear indicators."
