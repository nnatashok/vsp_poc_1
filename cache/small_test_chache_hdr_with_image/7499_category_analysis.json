  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is clearly focused on stretching, as indicated by the 'Workout Description' which highlights prioritizing stretching of hips, legs, and ankles. The inclusion of yoga blocks also suggests that the workout involves specific stretching exercises, aligning it with the 'Stretching' category. The 'Workout Type' and 'Category' both mention stretching and on-the-mat activities, confirming this classification.\n\nAdditionally, the description mentions 'on the mat' and the need for yoga blocks, suggesting that exercises are performed on the ground, linking it with the 'Mat' category. The setting overlooking Dublin adds an outdoor flavor, enhancing the experience but does not influence the classification.\n\nMusic genre or playlist does not specifically inform the workout type, but the presence of uplifting songs may enhance the relaxation element of the stretching. Overall, the explicit indicators in the metadata justify a high confidence level in classifying this as primarily 'Stretching' with 'Mat' as a secondary category."
