  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Rhythm 18 Row' primarily embodies the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to its focus on maintaining a steady rhythm (18 strokes per minute) and the use of music-driven pacing with Taylor Swift songs, facilitating a smooth, continuous movement pattern. This is supported by terms like 'rhythm' and 'jogging pace' in the workout description. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also relevant as the session follows a defined format with a maximum rhythm setting. Lastly, 'Soothing & Restorative' is applicable due to the low intensity (1 out of 3), beginner-friendly nature, and playlist of calming, lyrical pop music contributing to a gentle and relaxed experience. The image of rowing outdoors aligns with a natural setting, yet the core of the session doesn't heavily emphasize outdoor adventure, which keeps its classification distinct."
