  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout embodies a \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit, evidenced by the use of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and an intensity level of 3 out of 3. Phrases such as \"ignite your legs and lungs\" and \"bolt down the Charles River\" strongly indicate a vigorous session, with a high rhythm max of 32 further underscoring this classification (score: 0.9). The presence of rock music and global hits aligns well with maintaining high energy.\n\n\"Flow & Rhythm\" is also a suitable classification due to the music-driven pacing and coordination required in the rowing movement. The playlist includes songs that can create a rhythmic flow essential for maintaining consistent strokes (score: 0.6).\n\nFinally, \"Outdoor & Adventure\" is relevant as the workout utilizes a natural setting, the Charles River, making exploration and outdoor experience a key component. The visual imagery of being on the river reinforces the adventurous aspect (score: 0.7). The combination of these elements points to a mix of intense energy, rhythmic flow, and outdoor adventure."
