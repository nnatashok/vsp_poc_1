The intense nature and advanced fitness level support this classification. \"The Endorphin Wave\" is also relevant (0.7) due to the rowing format and rhythm-based elements, leading to a steady energy build. Lastly, \"The Nightclub Workout\" scores 0.5; the 80s and Global Hits music, along with the \"Stranger Things\" inspiration, adds a thematic, fun element similar to a party atmosphere typical of nightclub vibes. The choice of music such as \"Running Up That Hill\" and \"You Spin Me Round\" supports these energetic and immersive experiences."
