  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout described is a Pilates session, which typically involves floor exercises for strengthening the hips and core. This is reinforced by the category 'On The Mat' and the image showing a mat being used. Therefore, it is highly likely that a mat is required, warranting a high confidence score of 0.9. The mat provides a supportive surface for exercises performed while lying or sitting, essential in a Pilates routine focused on core strength."
