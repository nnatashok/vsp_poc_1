  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by its focus on stretching, particularly after a run, which aligns strongly with the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit. This classification is supported by descriptors such as \"prioritize stretching\" and \"after your run,\" emphasizing recovery and relaxation. The mention of \"yoga blocks recommended\" also suggests a supportive and gentle approach, justifying a high score of 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nThe element of \"Outdoor & Adventure\" is evident from the description mentioning \"overlooking Dublin\" and the provided image, which shows an outdoor setting with scenic views, suggesting engagement with nature. This aspect gives moderate support for \"Outdoor & Adventure,\" scoring 0.7.\n\nThe workout's description and keywords do not imply any structured protocol, intense energy, flow with rhythm, or sports-specific agility, thereby excluding these spirits from consideration. The confidence is high at 0.85 due to clear indications from both the metadata and imagery."
