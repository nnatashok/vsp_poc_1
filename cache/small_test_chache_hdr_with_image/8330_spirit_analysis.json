  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the focus on fluid 'twists flow' movements, which emphasize coordination and a mind-body connection. This is reinforced by the chill and downtempo music playlist featuring artists like Empire Of The Sun, which aligns with a rhythmic, continuous flow experience. The score for 'Flow & Rhythm' is therefore high at 0.9.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant, as the workout's aim to 'open your shoulders, chest, and back' and the usage of chill music suggests a focus on relaxation and gentle movement, deserving a score of 0.7. The session's purpose aligns with restorative practices to promote flexibility and ease.\n\nAdditionally, 'Outdoor & Adventure' receives a mild match with a score of 0.4 since the workout takes place outdoors by the water, offering a connection with nature that complements the calming environment. Although the primary focus is not on adventurous exploration, the setting adds a unique outdoor element."
