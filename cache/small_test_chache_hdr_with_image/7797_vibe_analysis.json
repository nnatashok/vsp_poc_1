  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is characterized by a steady, calming vibe. The key indicators come from the description of rowing steadily along the Charles River, suggesting a rhythmic and meditative experience, aligning it with 'The Meditative Grind,' which is given a score of 0.75 for its repetitive nature. Additionally, being a cool-down with mellow songs like 'Lover' and 'Love Story' by Taylor Swift implies relaxation and a refreshing quality, which aligns well with 'The Reboot Workout' scoring 0.7. The mention of a 'cool down' and the inclusion of soothing country and global hits music further validate 'The Zen Flow' with a score of 0.6, as it suggests a grounding and breath-centered session. The vibes are confirmed with high confidence (0.8) because of clear indicators in the title and description."
