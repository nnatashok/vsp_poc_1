  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is marked as 'Drive,' which is specifically noted as having an Advanced technique difficulty in Hydrow-specific rules. The use of 'power and speed,' coupled with 'going all out,' suggests complex movement execution at high intensity. This aligns with the technique difficulty expected for Advanced level rowing workouts.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout emphasizes 'exploding with power and speed' and includes a 'final 1-minute effort.' It is a drive-format workout, which typically requires sustained high intensity. The max rhythm of 30 and intensity level 3 out of 3 further indicate a very demanding session. These factors strongly support an Extreme effort difficulty classification.",
