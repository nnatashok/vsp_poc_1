  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout predominantly matches the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit due to the steady state rowing at rhythms 22 and 24, coupled with the pop and global hits playlist that likely encourages smooth and continuous movement. This is supported by the title \"Steady State Row\" and the focus on rhythm which emphasizes coordination and pacing. The spirit was scored at 0.75, indicating a strong match.\n\nThe \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit is also relevant due to the low intensity level (1 out of 3), the \"breathe\" tag, and the beginner fitness level, suggesting a more relaxed and restorative session. This spirit was scored at 0.55, indicating a moderate match.\n\nLastly, there is an element of \"Structured & Disciplined\" due to the fixed rhythm and cardio base-building focus. However, the overall session leans more towards flow, with this spirit scoring 0.4, showing a noticeable but lesser influence. Other spirits such as \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Sport & Agility\" are excluded due to the low intensity and absence of specific sports or performance-based elements."
