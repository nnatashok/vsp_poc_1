  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Peppy HIIT Row' features short 30-second and 60-second HIIT intervals, which align well with the vibe of 'The Firestarter' due to its fast-paced and explosive nature in a relatively short time span. The music genre, featuring upbeat and energetic 90s pop punk and global hits, hints at a lively atmosphere akin to 'The Nightclub Workout', suggesting a fun, music-driven experience with a score of 0.6. Additionally, the description mentions the energizing aspect of the intervals and rowing along the shores, which also contribute elements of enjoyment and drive, aligning lightly with 'The Endorphin Wave'. However, 'The Firestarter' is the primary match due to the high intensity and interval structure of the workout."
