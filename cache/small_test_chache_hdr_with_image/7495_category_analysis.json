  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily categorized as 'Mat' because the metadata indicates a focus on 'mobility and functional movement' 'on-the-mat', suggesting exercises performed on a mat, fitting with general floor exercises. The presence of 'standard, on-the-mat' in the category tags further supports this classification. The score of 0.7 reflects the strong alignment with typical Mat workouts.\n\nThe secondary category, 'Body weight', is chosen due to the mention of 'strength building exercises' which are often performed using body weight, especially given the absence of specified equipment. The score of 0.6 indicates a moderate to strong presence of body weight exercises.\n\nOther categories like 'Running' or any machine-based workouts were excluded as they do not fit the description or available metadata, focusing instead on non-equipment-based training."
