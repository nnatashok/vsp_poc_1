  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Bootcamp HIIT Row\" emphasizes high intensity through short intervals and an advanced intensity level (3 out of 3), clearly aligning it with the \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit. The HIIT format and use of high-energy music, such as Calvin Harris and Skrillex, further reinforce this classification. The score of 0.9 indicates a very strong match to this spirit.\n\nThe \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit is less dominant but present. The workout includes music-driven pacing from dance and global hits, suggesting some elements of rhythmic flow, hence a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nThe \"Sport & Agility\" spirit is suggested by the athletic focus of rowing and the image of participants on a waterway, indicating performance-based elements. Including \"navigate Indian Creek\" suggests a sport-related aspect, earning a score of 0.6.\n\nOther spirits like \"Soothing & Restorative\" and \"Outdoor & Adventure\" are less relevant due to the workout's intense and structured nature, despite being outdoors. \"Structured & Disciplined\" is also not highly relevant, as the workout seems more focused on intensity and less on precision or protocol."
