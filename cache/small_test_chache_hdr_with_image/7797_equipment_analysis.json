  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as a cool-down activity where participants 'row steadily along the Charles River,' which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine, particularly since it is listed yet the workout is virtual. The presence of 'row' in the type and category further supports this interpretation, leading to a very high confidence of 0.8. The image shows outdoor rowing, but for a virtual workout, this would typically translate to using a rowing machine indoors."
