  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is categorized primarily under 'Indoor rowing' with high confidence due to several explicit indicators. The image clearly shows a rowing machine, and the description emphasizes 'legs-only drill' and 'proper foot placement,' which are specific to rowing mechanics. Additionally, the workout name, 'Drive Through Your Feet,' suggests a rowing motion, highlighting the drive phase of rowing. Despite being labeled as a 'warm-up,' the focus on rowing technique and equipment use strongly supports the 'Indoor rowing' category. Other categories like 'Stretching' or 'Mat' are excluded due to the specific context and equipment used."
