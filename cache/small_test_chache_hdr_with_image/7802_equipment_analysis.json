  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout name 'Racing Rock Row' and the description mention tackling 'high rhythm numbers,' explicitly linking to rowing. The category and format ('Drive', 'standard', 'row', 'Intervals') further indicate that this is a rowing workout. The use of intervals and a specific rhythm (max rhythm: 34) aligns with rowing machine workouts. Additionally, the image shows a person rowing, reinforcing the need for a rowing machine. Therefore, the rowing machine is essential for performing this workout, with a confidence level of 1 (very high confidence)."
