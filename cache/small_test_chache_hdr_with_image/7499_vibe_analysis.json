  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is clearly focused on post-run stretching with an emphasis on relaxing muscles such as hips, legs, and ankles. This aligns strongly with 'The Deep Recharge,' which involves nervous system reset and gentle movement, evidenced by the duration and stretching emphasis. The environment described as \"overlooking Dublin\" further supports a peaceful and scenic vibe, contributing to the classification. \n\nThe mention of yoga blocks and the stretching category suggest a cadence of slow and mindful movement, typical of 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which involves low stress and total body refreshment.\n\n'Zen Flow' is also relevant, though with slightly less intensity, as the workout includes intentional, unhurried stretching components indicative of grounding and breath-centered exercises.\n\nThe music, featuring dance and global hits, introduces a slight energetic contrast, but the lack of music-specific metadata keeps the confidence for 'Zen Flow' a bit lower. Overall, the metadata strongly supports a relaxation and recovery-focused session."
