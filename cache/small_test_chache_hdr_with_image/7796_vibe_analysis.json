  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Climbing Intervals Row' with a duration of 21 minutes and 21 seconds primarily features interval training with changing rates (22 to 26), emphasizing the repetition and endurance aspects of rowing. This aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, as rowing is typically a repetitive endurance activity. The score of 0.7 was given due to strong indicators of endurance and focus.\n\nAdditionally, the inclusion of music genres like Soul/Funk/Disco and pop hits, along with the moderate climbing intervals, suggests an uplifting and steady build in energy, aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave.' The music choice adds an energizing and feel-good atmosphere, justifying a score of 0.6 for this vibe.\n\nOverall, the workout seems to be designed for beginners, focusing on steady state progress with foundational rowing techniques, which supports these vibe selections. Other potential vibes like 'The Groove Session' or 'The Nightclub Workout' were excluded due to the lack of strong dance or rhythm-based elements."
