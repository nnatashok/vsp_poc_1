  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.9 due to the description emphasizing eight 1-minute intervals ('Ready to rev your engine?' and 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3'), which suggests a focus on maximum effort and high intensity. The playlist includes energetic rock songs like 'Born To Be Wild' and 'Up Around The Bend,' which further support this classification. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit also applies with a score of 0.7, as the workout follows a clear, methodical interval format that requires precision and a specific rhythm ('max rhythm: 32'). The focus on complementing a runner's program suggests an advanced and disciplined approach to training. Other spirits were not chosen because there is no emphasis on relaxation, flow, or agility outside structured intervals, and it is not conducted outdoors."
