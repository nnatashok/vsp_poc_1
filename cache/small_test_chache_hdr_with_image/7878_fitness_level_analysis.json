  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout 'Joyful Intention Row' includes rowing at a jog pace, aligned with the 'breathe' workout type, which typically involves maintaining steady, rhythmic rowing. The technique involved is basic, suitable for beginners, but the pyramid format (climbing up and down rhythm) adds a slight complexity, making it also somewhat appropriate for intermediates. The method for rowing itself doesn't involve advanced techniques or complex coordination, leading to a high confidence in beginner classification with moderate alignment to intermediate.",
