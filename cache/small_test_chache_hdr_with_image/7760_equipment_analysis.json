  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Go Low Cool-Down,' is categorized under 'row,' indicating the use of a rowing machine. The 'Reverse Climb' format and reference to rhythm further suggest rowing activity. The image also shows a person using a rowing machine, confirming its use. Hence, I assigned the 'Rowing machine' a confidence score of 0.9, as it is central to the workout."
