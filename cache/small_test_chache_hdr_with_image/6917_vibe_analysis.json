  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Yoga Flow,' indicating a focus on smooth, continuous movement typical of 'The Zen Flow.' The setting in a sunny park and the use of chill music genres such as cool/downtempo suggest a grounding and calming experience, aligning with this vibe. The consistent, rhythmic aspect of a flow workout, combined with the ambient and soothing soundtrack, also suggests elements of 'The Meditative Grind,' where repetition can lead to a meditative state. The duration of approximately 21 minutes supports a moderate level of engagement without high intensity. Though there isn't specific mention of breathwork, the overall description and music choices imply a serene, breath-centered focus that matches 'The Zen Flow.' The confidence is rated at 0.8 based on the strong indicators present in the title and music, with moderate confidence in 'The Meditative Grind' due to the flow's potential for rhythmic repetition."
