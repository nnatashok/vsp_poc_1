  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Rhythm 18 Row' is characterized by a low-intensity level with a focus on steady, rhythmic rowing and the practice of patience, which strongly aligns with 'The Meditative Grind'. This vibe is supported by the explicit emphasis on a steady rhythm (18) and the meditative pace, reflected in both the description and format titled as 'breathe'. The music selection featuring soothing tracks by Taylor Swift further enhances a calming and contemplative environment, justifying a high confidence score of 0.9 for this vibe.\n\nThe routine's gentle, breath-focused practice, along with the categorization under 'Breathe', supports 'The Zen Flow' vibe as well. The leisurely jogging pace and the pop music playlist contribute to a serene and intentional atmosphere, earning this vibe a moderate confidence score of 0.7. The unsettled aspect of unspecified music genre adds slight ambiguity, but the overall tone of relaxation and focus is clear, excluding more intense or fast-paced vibes."
