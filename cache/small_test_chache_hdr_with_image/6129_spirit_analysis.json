  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is clearly defined as a 'Restorative Yoga' session in the title, and terms like 'gently move' and 'spend time in each pose' in the description strongly indicate a focus on recovery and relaxation, making 'Soothing & Restorative' a perfect match with the highest confidence (1.0). The metadata also highlights the setting in Lucerne, Switzerland, which is outdoor and serene, contributing to the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The gentle and calm music genres such as 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' are consistent with a restorative and gentle workout atmosphere. The choice of this music further enhances the soothing nature of the session. Although the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is relevant due to the outdoor setting, it is not the session's primary focus, resulting in a lower score (0.7). The structured, high-energy, and sports-type spirits do not fit based on the metadata provided."
