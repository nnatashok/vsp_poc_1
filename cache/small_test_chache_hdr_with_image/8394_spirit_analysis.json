  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, 'Foot + Ankle Focused Yoga,' led by Owen with a view of Boston Harbor, encompasses several key spirits. 'Soothing & Restorative' scores 0.8 due to the focus on gentle, healing movement in the feet and ankles, paired with chill and downtempo music that supports relaxation. The yoga-style format further reinforces this restful element. 'Flow & Rhythm' receives a score of 0.6, based on the continuous movement patterns typical of yoga, suggesting an emphasis on mind-body connection and rhythm. The title 'align' under 'Workout Type' also indicates a structured flow. The outdoor setting ('overlooking Boston Harbor') adds an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit at 0.5, suggesting a connection with nature and the environment, even though it's not the primary focus. This variety of spirits reflects the workout\u2019s holistic, restorative nature while offering a balanced, rhythmic practice."
