  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is characterized by elements that align it with several spirits. Firstly, 'Flow & Rhythm' is highlighted by the steady rhythm of 22 and the continuous, mindful pace of rowing described as 'steady' and 'at rhythm 22'. This is further supported by the use of a non-intense music playlist featuring songs like 'One Of Us' by Joan Osborne, which suggests a rhythmic, flowing experience (score: 0.7).\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant here due to the low intensity level (1 out of 3) and the categorization under 'Breathe'. The learning aspect about Scandinavian mythology during the workout adds to a calming, meditative quality (score: 0.6).\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is somewhat reflected by the rowing imagery and the mention of mythology and nature in the video, suggesting an outdoor, exploratory theme, even though it's not explicit (score: 0.4).\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', and 'Sport & Agility' are less relevant due to the steady, calming focus and low intensity of the session."
