  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'HIIT' with a score of 0.9, as the workout is explicitly described as a 'HIIT style workout' focusing on high-intensity interval training with strength components, as noted in the title and description. The term 'strength' alongside HIIT suggests a focus on strength-building exercises, often characteristic of bodyweight training, which justifies the inclusion of 'Body weight' with a score of 0.7.\n\nThe 'Mat' category is also relevant due to the phrase 'On The Mat' and standard mat workouts typically involving bodyweight exercises. The outdoor setting depicted in the image supports a workout that may focus on strength and cardio without equipment, but it's not entirely characteristic of traditional mat exercises, giving it a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nMusic choice with upbeat tracks like 'Freedom', 'Pressure', and 'Runaway (U & I)' aligns with the high-energy workout style typical of HIIT sessions. Other categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' are not applicable due to lack of relevant cues."
