  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Foot + Ankle Focused Yoga', clearly indicating a yoga practice with a specific focus on feet and ankles. The description reinforces this by emphasizing movement and strength in the feet and ankles. The inclusion of yoga blocks in the image further supports the yoga categorization. Therefore, 'Yoga' is assigned a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe mention of focusing on movement and strength suggests elements of flexibility and mobility training, which aligns with 'Stretching'. This is given a secondary score of 0.7 as stretching is likely an important component but not the primary focus.\n\nThe context and content imply a confident categorization, hence the categories confidence level is set at 0.9, indicating very high confidence. Other categories such as 'Mat' could apply given the workout is performed on a mat, but 'Yoga' and 'Stretching' are more directly relevant."
