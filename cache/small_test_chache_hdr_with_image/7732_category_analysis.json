  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is titled \"Back Bends Align,\" which indicates a focus on body alignment and flexibility, typical elements of Yoga. The description mentions \"practice backbends\" and \"start gently,\" both common in Yoga and Stretching routines, supporting the classification of Yoga (score: 0.75) and Stretching (score: 0.65). The use of the term \"align\" similarly reinforces the Yoga focus. The category \"On The Mat\" in the metadata suggests exercises performed on a mat without additional equipment, hence the inclusion of the Mat category (score: 0.6). The playlist features chill and downtempo music, aligning with a relaxing, contemplative practice such as Yoga or Stretching. The presence of these aspects gives high confidence to these classifications, particularly Yoga and Stretching."
