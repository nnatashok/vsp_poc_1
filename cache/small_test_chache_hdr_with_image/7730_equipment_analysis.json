  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled '80s Intervals Row,' and the category includes 'row,' indicating that a rowing machine is central to this workout. The description emphasizes tackling intervals, a common format using rowing machines for cardio workouts. Additionally, the image displays an individual rowing on a watercraft, which implies that the exercise mimics outdoor rowing, commonly replicated indoors with rowing machines. Therefore, a rowing machine is highly likely required, and a confidence score of 0.9 is assigned for its need."
