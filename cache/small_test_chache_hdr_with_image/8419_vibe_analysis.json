  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Drive Through Your Feet' and focuses on foot placement and form, which aligns with 'The Masterclass Workout' due to its emphasis on technique and skill-building. The description indicates a specific drill ('legs-only'), and the lack of intensity or fast-paced music suggests a methodical rather than energetic atmosphere, supporting this classification. The short duration and warm-up type further reinforce this vibe. The choice of songs such as '99 Red Balloons', which is upbeat yet not too fast, suggests a light, engaging atmosphere, potentially fitting 'The Zen Flow' due to its grounding and intentional vibe, although with less confidence due to the focus on technique rather than a meditative flow."
