  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Drive', a Hydrow-specific designation indicating high technique demands often requiring good rowing form and coordination. The use of the term 'HIIT' suggests complex interval planning, and performing at a max rhythm of 30 can be challenging. The user fitness level requirement is set as 'Advanced', corroborating the technique demands. Overall, this aligns strongly with Advanced and significantly with Expert technique levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The listed workout intensity level is 3 out of 3, indicating a very high effort requirement. The format is HIIT, inherently associated with high energy expenditure due to its intense burst nature. The duration of around 21 minutes, coupled with high-intensity intervals, signifies a Challenging to Extreme level of effort. The rock music and high rhythm enhance this intensity further. Overall, this strongly supports a Challenging effort level with some alignment to Extreme.",
