  "vibesExplanation": "The workout \"Core Flow\" has a strong \"The Zen Flow\" vibe, supported by its focus on a 'heat-building flow' as described in the metadata. The use of a yoga block and the \"On The Mat\" category imply a grounding and intentional practice typical of slow-flow yoga. The playlist with songs like 'Green Light' and 'Nightcall (Breakbot Remix)' suggests a cool, downtempo rhythm that aligns with a more calming and breath-centered workout, scoring 0.75.\n\nAdditionally, the \"The Meditative Grind\" vibe is applicable. The title 'Core Flow' and the mention of 'heat-building' create an impression of sustained effort and focus, which fits with a repetitive, endurance-style grind, justified by assigning a score of 0.6. The absence of any high-intensity cues excludes more energetic vibes, and the duration of about 21 minutes, while brief, supports a focused practice session."
