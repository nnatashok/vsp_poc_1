  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'HIIT' due to explicit mentions of 'high-intensity session,' '60-second intervals,' and 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3.' These indicators strongly suggest a workout designed around high-intensity interval training, warranting a score of 0.8 for the HIIT category. Additionally, it can be associated with 'Indoor rowing,' despite the image showing outdoor rowing, since the description and the title ('Rage Row') imply a rowing workout. The usage of 'row' in the category, and the focus on rowing techniques support this association, scoring it at 0.7. The imagery supports rowing activity, although possibly in an outdoor setting, maintaining relevance to the classification. Other categories were considered less relevant due to the specific focus on intensity and rowing as primary features in the workout."
