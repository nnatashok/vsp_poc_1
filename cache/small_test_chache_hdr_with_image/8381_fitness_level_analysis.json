  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout employs the 'Drive' type, a specific Hydrow categorization known for advanced technique requirements. The metadata describes high-intensity intervals, which typically involve complex sequences to maintain proper rowing form at high rhythm peaks (up to 32 strokes per minute). These elements demand significant skill and coordination, justifying the Advanced classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Pure Energy Row' involves high-intensity intervals with a max rhythm of 32, indicating a very demanding session. The intensity level is 3 out of 3, suggesting maximal effort is required, especially for a 21-minute workout. The combination of high rhythm and minimal rest periods characteristic of 'Drive' formats contributes to an Extreme effort classification.",
