  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title and description suggest that the workout is part of a 'Runner's Program' but emphasizes rowing, as indicated by terms like '400m repeats' and metadata tags such as 'drive', 'standard', and 'row'. The image further supports this by showing a person on a rowing setup, enhancing the likelihood of indoor rowing equipment being used. Therefore, a rowing machine is required, with very high confidence (0.9), as it is central to the workout's drive format and interval nature."
