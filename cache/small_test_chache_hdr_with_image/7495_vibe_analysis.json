  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Runner's Program #1 of 9', indicating a methodical training plan which aligns with 'The Progression Quest' vibe, focused on long-term improvement and strength building. The description mentions 'mobility and functional movement for runners' which suggests a structured approach, typical of progression-led workouts.\n\nThe music playlist, featuring remixes and dance hits, infuses an energetic and fun atmosphere into the workout, adding elements of 'The Groove Session'. This is supported by tracks like 'Sweet But Psycho (Morgan Page Dance Remix)' which promote a joyful, expressive vibe, although the strength training focus reduces this vibe's dominance.\n\nThe confidence level is moderate to high due to clear indications of a structured, progressive workout paired with dance music that adds a layer of enjoyment."
