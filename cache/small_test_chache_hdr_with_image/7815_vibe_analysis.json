  "vibesExplanation": "The workout metadata suggests a 'The Meditative Grind' vibe with a score of 0.7 due to the 'core strengthening' focus, 'on the mat' category, and its repetitive, focused nature aimed at igniting the core. The use of dance and global hit music playlists, including energetic tracks like 'Shivers (Dillon Francis Remix)' and 'Watch Your Step,' aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, scoring 0.6, as these elements suggest elevated energy and a feel-good atmosphere. While the primary focus is on core strength, the optional use of yoga blocks hints at a calming, focused element characteristic of 'The Zen Flow,' though this is less pronounced with a score of 0.4. The duration is short, which excludes longer endurance-based vibes. The absence of high-intensity elements guides the exclusion of more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout.'"
