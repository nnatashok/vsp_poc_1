  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"The Firestarter\" (score: 0.85) due to its high intensity interval training style and short duration of 21 minutes. The description highlights a \"sprint track workout\" format, emphasizing fast, explosive, and electrifying effort that aligns with this vibe. Music from pop and global hits such as \"Titanium\" adds an energizing and stimulating atmosphere, supporting this classification.\n\nAdditionally, the workout has elements of \"The Endorphin Wave\" (score: 0.7), as it provides an elevated energy and feel-good movement experience, particularly with songs like \"Good To Be Alive\" and \"Wake Me Up\" that contribute to a steady, motivational build.\n\n\"The Competitor\" vibe (score: 0.6) is relevant due to the high intensity level 3 out of 3 and advanced fitness level requirement, suggesting a performance-driven, full-send energy typical in gamified and competitive settings. The presence of a structured, interval-based program further supports this vibe.\n\nOverall, the classification is high confidence based on the explicit intensity cues and music playlist provided."
