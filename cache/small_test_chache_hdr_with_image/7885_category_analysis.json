  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Pilates' due to explicit references in the title ('Post-Row Pilates') and description indicating a Pilates routine. The descriptor 'Stretch your hips and hold a few planks' supports the inclusion of 'Stretching' as a secondary category with moderate confidence, given the emphasis on hip stretching and core workouts common in Pilates. The mention of 'on the mat' in the category section, along with the imagery of the workout performed outside on a mat, justifies classifying it under 'Mat' exercises. The outdoor setting adds a unique aspect but does not alter the primary classification."
