  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'On The Mat,' explicitly indicating that a mat is required, which is confirmed by its mention in the category and the use of a mat in the provided image, leading to a very high confidence score of 1.0. Additionally, the image shows yoga blocks, and 'flow' workouts often involve yoga elements where blocks may be used to aid in stretches and poses. This gives a high confidence score of 0.9 for blocks. The description involves hip-opening movements, which are often supported by these items."
