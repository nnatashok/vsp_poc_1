  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.9. Evidence from the title ('Recovery Cool-Down') and description ('cooling your body down,' 'reinforcing technique') indicates a focus on recovery and gentle exercise, which is central to the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The workout type and category 'cool down' further support this classification.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is present to a moderate extent (score of 0.5) due to the steady rhythm of max 22 and the inclusion of songs by artists known for rhythmic music. This suggests an element of movement and coordination along with the musical influence, albeit not the primary focus.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' also has some relevance (score of 0.3) as the workout aims to 'reinforce technique,' indicating an attention to form and methodical execution. However, this is less pronounced compared to the recovery focus."
