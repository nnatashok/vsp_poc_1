  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized by its short, intense bursts of activity, typical of a HIIT format, which aligns well with 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its fast, explosive, and electrifying nature. The use of 50-second and 10-second intervals at high rhythm rates (26 and 32) further supports this classification. The music playlist featuring upbeat tracks like 'Levels' by Avicii and 'Honey, I'm Good.' by Andy Grammer enhances the energetic atmosphere, contributing to this vibe.\n\n'Warrior Workout' is another applicable vibe due to the significant intensity level (3 out of 3) and advanced fitness level requirements, indicating a high-demand workout focusing on unleashing primal energy.\n\n'Competitor' vibe is slightly relevant given the advanced level and structured intervals, suggesting a gamified or performance-driven aspect, but less explicit indicators were provided in the descriptions to strongly support this vibe. Thus, the score for this is moderate."
