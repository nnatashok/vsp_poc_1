  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is predominantly classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' due to its focus on breath and stillness, as indicated by the title and description. The use of words like 'breath' and 'restorative practice' suggest a calming and recovery-focused energy, earning it a score of 1. The brief duration further supports the likelihood of it being a gentle routine.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit receives a moderate score of 0.4, as the mention of feeling the breath in each pose suggests some continuous movement and a connection between breath and movement, which aligns with principles of flow and rhythm. However, the main emphasis remains on restoration rather than continuous movement, resulting in a lower score for this spirit.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to lack of indicators of intensity or technical protocol-driven elements. The setting or background, while visually interesting, does not suggest an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the content's focus."
