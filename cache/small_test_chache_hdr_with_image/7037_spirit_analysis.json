  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Post-Row Stretch' is primarily characterized by elements that align with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This assessment is based on the focus on stretching, which is inherently relaxing and recovery-focused, as indicated by the description \"Focus on stretching your hip flexors and adductors after any row.\" This aligns well with the concept of healing and recovery, deserving a score of 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the music genre 'Dance mid, Global Hits' and songs by artists such as Kygo and Labrinth suggest a smooth flow that supports continuous movement, which justifies the inclusion of 'Flow & Rhythm' with a moderate score of 0.5. The use of music could encourage a certain rhythmic pacing during the stretches.\n\nThe emphasis on post-row recovery and relaxation excludes more intense spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and others, ensuring a high confidence level in the selected spirits classification."
