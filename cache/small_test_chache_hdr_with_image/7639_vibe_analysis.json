  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is classified primarily as 'The Zen Flow' with a score of 0.8, due to the 'beginner friendly flow' and the scenic setting of Achill Island, promoting a grounding and intentional movement style. The music selections like 'Dawn' and 'Sundream' support a calming, unhurried vibe. 'The Nature Flow' is also a strong fit with a score of 0.7, as the workout takes place outdoors and references the natural beauty of the location. Lastly, 'The Meditative Grind' scores 0.5, reflecting the meditative repetition of yoga, although this is not the strongest match due to the shorter duration and flow style which reduces intense focus on repetition. The playlist's chill, downtempo music further emphasizes the relaxed atmosphere."
