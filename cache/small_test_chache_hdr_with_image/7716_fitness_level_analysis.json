  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Drive', which indicates a higher level of complexity due to requiring precise body mechanics and coordination at a high rhythm (30). Technique in rowing at such intensity, particularly in HIIT format, demands advanced technical skills to maintain proper form throughout the intervals, leading to a high rating in Technique Difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity level of 3 out of 3 and the HIIT format with 1-minute max-effort intervals followed by 1-minute recovery suggests a high level of physical exertion. The short duration of 11 minutes does not allow for 'Extreme' classification but makes it 'Challenging' due to the sustained high-intensity effort needed.",
