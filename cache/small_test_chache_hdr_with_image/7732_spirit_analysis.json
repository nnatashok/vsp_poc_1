  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Back Bends Align' primarily embodies the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The emphasis on backbends, a type of yoga practice, along with the aim to align, suggests a focus on smooth, continuous movement and coordination. The chill, downtempo music and titles like 'Sunlight' and 'Sundream' further imply a rhythmic and flowy session. A confidence score of 0.75 is assigned as these elements align well with the flow concept. \n\nAdditionally, the workout displays 'Soothing & Restorative' qualities due to its gentle start and the categorization under 'On The Mat,' which typically indicates a more calming approach. The music and brief 15-minute duration support a relaxed, recovery-focused environment. However, the absence of explicitly restorative terms in the description results in a score of 0.7. \n\nThe high confidence level of 0.8 reflects the clear indicators of flow and soothing elements, though the absence of explicit recovery terms prevents assigning a higher score to soothing and restorative."
