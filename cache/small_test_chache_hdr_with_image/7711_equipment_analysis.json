  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'To the Max Row' and categorized under 'row,' strongly indicating that rowing is central to the workout. The description mentions 'climbing in rhythm' through a 'series of 45-second intervals,' which is a common format for rowing workouts. Although the image depicts outdoor rowing, typically an indoor rowing machine will be used for such structured interval training. Therefore, a rowing machine is highly likely to be required, with a confidence score of 0.9. The metadata does not suggest the need for any other equipment."
