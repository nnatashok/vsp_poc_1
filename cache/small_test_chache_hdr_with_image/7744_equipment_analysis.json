  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described under the 'Category: Drive,standard,row', strongly indicating the use of a rowing machine. The reference to 'row' and the emphasis on 'power and speed' further support this. The exercise type 'drive' is consistent with rowing terminology. Additionally, the image shows someone rowing on a body of water, which relates to rowing equipment, although in an indoor workout context, this typically translates to using a rowing machine. Thus, the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high at 0.9."
