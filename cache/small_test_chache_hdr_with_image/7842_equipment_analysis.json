  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description mentions moving through a series of core exercises and lists it under the 'On The Mat' category, strongly indicating the use of a mat. This is reinforced by the image showing a participant exercising on a mat. Therefore, the confidence level for a mat is very high at 0.9. Yoga blocks are mentioned as optional, giving them a low confidence score of 0.25, since they are not essential but suggested for those who might want them for support or modification of poses."
