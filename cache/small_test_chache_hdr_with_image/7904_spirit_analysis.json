  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout features elements of both 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure.' The title 'Step by Step Row' and description indicate a focus on rhythm and progression, as seen in the max rhythm setting and the mention of elevating rhythm. The usage of 'breathe' as a category further supports a rhythmic and paced approach, scoring a 0.75 match for 'Flow & Rhythm.'\n\nThe setting at Lake Tahoe and accompanying imagery strongly suggest an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, with the natural backdrop offering exploration and an outdoor challenge, thus scoring a 0.7 match.\n\nLastly, the low intensity level, 'breathe' category, and relaxed music genre (Indie Alternative) also hint at a 'Soothing & Restorative' nature, as these elements collectively create a calming environment, earning a moderate 0.5 match. The slight emphasis on environmental visuals supports this.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to lack of high intensity, specific sports skills focus, or structured progressive protocols, aligning primarily with these selected spirits."
