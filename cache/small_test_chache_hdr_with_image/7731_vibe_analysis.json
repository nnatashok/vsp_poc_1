  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Steady State Row' fits well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, as indicated by the terms 'steady', 'rhythms 22 and 24', and 'build your cardio base'. The consistent rhythm and focus on endurance rowing suggest a repetitive and calming experience despite the explicit lyrics. This justifies a score of 0.7, suggesting a strong match.\n\nThe second vibe, 'The Endorphin Wave', is also relevant due to the music selection. Songs like 'DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love' and 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii promote a feel-good, continuous energy build-up which matches the steadiness and prolonged effort of the workout. The music supports a steady but elevated energy, justifying a score of 0.6.\n\nThe workout likely does not fit more intense categories like 'The Adrenaline Rush' due to its low intensity level and beginner focus."
