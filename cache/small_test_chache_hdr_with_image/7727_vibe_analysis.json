  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled \"Cardio Cruise Row,\" is described as low intensity and longer in duration, aligning with the characteristics of \"The Meditative Grind,\" which involves zoning in and letting repetition take over. The 60s/70s rock and global hits playlist supports a consistent rhythm, reinforcing this vibe (score: 0.75).\n\nThe \"workout type\" and \"category\" emphasize 'breathe,' suggesting a focus on intention and breath, which is indicative of \"The Zen Flow\" vibe, centering on grounding and breath-centered movement. The music choices and low intensity further support this gentle vibe (score: 0.6). The confidence is high due to specific indicators pointing toward both vibes, despite no explicit mention of the music genre. The workout's emphasis on relaxation excludes higher intensity vibes like \"The Warrior Workout.\""
