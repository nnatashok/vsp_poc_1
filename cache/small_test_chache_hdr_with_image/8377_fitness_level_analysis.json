  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout focuses on 'core over positioning', indicating a concentration on proper rowing form rather than intensity or complexity, suitable for beginners. The classification 'Technique' suggests some focus on skill development, possibly elevating it to intermediate for some users. However, the 'Breathe' format emphasizes basic breathing and rhythm, supporting a beginner-friendly classification. User requirements confirm a 'Beginner' level alignment, which supports this assessment.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 16-minute duration with a low intensity level (1 out of 3) suggests a light-to-moderate effort demand. The maximum rhythm of 26 strokes per minute further implies a controlled pace. The 'Breathe' workout type typically involves lower intensity, promoting a 'Light' classification with some potential for 'Moderate' due to rhythm work.",
