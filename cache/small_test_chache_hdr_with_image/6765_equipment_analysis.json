  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is identified as \"Bootcamp HIIT Row,\" with the description indicating short intervals and quick recovery. Keywords such as \"row\" in both the name and category strongly suggest the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the term \"navigate Indian Creek\" and the image showing people rowing outdoors aligns with rowing activities. Given the focus on rowing and absence of other indicated exercises, the rowing machine is necessary, leading to a very high confidence score of 0.9."
