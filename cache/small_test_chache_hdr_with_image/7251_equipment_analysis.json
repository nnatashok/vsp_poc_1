  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Bodyweight Strength,\" which indicates no external weights are used; strength training is done using just body weight. The category is listed as \"On The Mat,\" suggesting exercises are performed on a mat. The image shows two people sitting on mats, further confirming their use. Therefore, a mat is required for this workout. Since the description emphasizes bodyweight exercises, no other equipment is needed or mentioned, leading to very high confidence in the necessity of a mat."
