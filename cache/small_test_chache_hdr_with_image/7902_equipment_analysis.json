  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is named \"Weekly Stories Row,\" and the description explicitly mentions rowing. The metadata specifies categories such as 'sweat' and 'row,' which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. The interval format and reference to rowing with music also suggest a focus on rowing exercises. The confidence score is set at 0.8 as the requirement for a rowing machine is very strong but not explicitly stated in terms of equipment needed. The image depicts a rowing scenario, reinforcing the need for a rowing machine."
