  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout title 'Climbing Intervals Warm-Up' suggests a focus on warm-up activity with climbing intervals, which aligns with an aerobic warm-up approach often found in rowing workouts. The term 'Climb up in rhythm' and the visual content showing rowing equipment further support classification as 'Indoor rowing' with a strong presence (score: 0.9). The inclusion of a rhythmic and aerobic component typical in rowing warm-ups is evident. \n\nThe 'Mat' category is considered with a lower score (0.2) due to the mention of a general warm-up format, which may include basic floor exercises; however, this is not a central theme. The overall confidence is high (0.85) based on explicit rowing imagery and terminology, with minimal ambiguity about the primary intent of the workout."
