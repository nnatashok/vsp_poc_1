  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Rhythm 30 HIIT Row' is primarily categorized as 'High-Energy & Intense.' This is supported by the workout format 'HIIT' (High-Intensity Interval Training), which inherently involves high energy and intensity during the one-minute exertion intervals. The description emphasizes exerting 'max pressure,' indicative of a vigorous workout requiring maximum effort. The workout is also rated at maximum intensity level (3 out of 3) and features a playlist with high-energy pop and rock tracks, further supporting this classification. The score of 0.9 reflects these strong indicators.\n\nThe workout also carries elements of 'Flow & Rhythm,' as indicated by the consistent rhythmic pacing ('rhythm 30') and the integration of music, which often contributes to a sense of flow and coordination. Although flow and rhythm are not the primary focus, these elements are noticeable within the workout structure, leading to a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Sport & Agility' were considered less relevant based on the lack of specific sports skills or technical protocols. 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are clearly not applicable given the workout's nature and setting."
