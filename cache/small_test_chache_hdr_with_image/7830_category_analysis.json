  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Indoor rowing' with very high confidence (0.95). The title 'Climbing Intervals Row' and the description mentioning 'technique with Dani during intervals' indicate a focus on rowing workouts. Although the image shows outdoor rowing, the metadata aligns more closely with indoor rowing practices, involving rhythm and climbing intervals typical of rowing machine workouts. The intensity level 2 out of 3 and mention of 'sweat' further supports this classification, as such descriptors are common in rowing exercises designed for fitness. Other categories like 'HIIT' or 'Mat' were considered, but there is no evidence of high-intensity intervals or non-equipment exercise, respectively. The music selection ('Latin, Global Hits') complements an energetic workout, reinforcing the rowing classification."
