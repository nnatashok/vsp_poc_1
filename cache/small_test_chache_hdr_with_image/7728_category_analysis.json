  "categoriesExplanation": "The video titled \"Fix Your Posture\" suggests a focus on improving posture through mobility exercises which typically involve stretching routines. The description explicitly mentions 'mobility' and 'fix your posture', indicating exercises to improve flexibility and everyday functioning, aligning closely with the \"Stretching\" category. This is further reinforced by the tag 'On The Mat', suggesting exercises conducted on the floor, which involves mat-based routines. Therefore, \"Stretching\" scores 0.7, with \"Mat\" scoring 0.6 due to the \"on-the-mat\" tag. The music genre doesn't significantly influence the workout type, remaining more of a background element. Overall, the classification leans strongly towards these categories due to explicit mentions of mobility and mat usage, providing high confidence in this analysis."
