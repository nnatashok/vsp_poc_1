  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's short duration of just under 6 minutes ensures a low energy expenditure, suitable for beginners. The \u2018cool down\u2019 classification indicates a recovery focus, which corresponds to light effort. The rhythm and steady pace suggest a comfortable intensity. However, the format being 'steady' might offer moderate exertion for less conditioned users, justifying a moderate score as well.",
