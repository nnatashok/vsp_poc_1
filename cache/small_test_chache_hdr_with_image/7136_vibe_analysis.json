  "vibesExplanation": "This workout, titled 'Finding Breath and Stillness Restore,' emphasizes breath and a restorative practice, aligning closely with 'The Zen Flow.' The focus on feeling breath in each pose indicates a grounding, intentional, and breath-centered approach, justifying a high score of 0.85. The description suggests a relaxing, low-intensity session supported by the 'restore' type and 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' music, aligning with 'The Reboot Workout,' scoring 0.7 as it's meant to refresh rather than challenge. There's a possible complement of 'The Deep Recharge,' scoring 0.5, since the restorative nature suggests a gentle, nervous system-resetting practice, though there's less explicit support for this compared to the other vibes. The overall confidence is decent due to specific keywords like 'breath,' 'restore,' and music genre, all indicative of a calming session."
