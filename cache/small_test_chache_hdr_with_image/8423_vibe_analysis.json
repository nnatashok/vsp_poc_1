  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'All in One Row' primarily embodies 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, as indicated by the row focus, which often involves repetitive and steady movements. The interval format and 31-minute duration align with characteristics of sustained exertion. The use of 90's and global hits in the playlist suggests rhythmic and motivating beats, which enhances this vibe, assigning a score of 0.75.\n\nThe inclusion of songs with a positive and steady beat like 'Send Me On My Way' and 'Shine' suggests an uplifting experience that fits 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, with a moderate intensity level. This creates a feel-good mood with a score of 0.65.\n\nLastly, the structured format of a warm-up, sweat session, and cool down, as well as 'sweat' being a primary workout type, suggests elements of 'The Disciplined Grind'. The workout requires focus and delivery on a set goal of endurance rowing, leading to a score of 0.4.\n\nOverall, there's a high confidence level due to clear indicators in the workout format and style, but there's some overlap with disciplines, hence the slightly lower individual scores for competing vibes."
