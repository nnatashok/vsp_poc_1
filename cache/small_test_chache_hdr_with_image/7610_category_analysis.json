  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Indoor rowing' with a high confidence score of 0.9 due to the reference to rowing in the title and metadata, as well as the image showing rowing on water. The description mentions 'sprint pace' and 'max effort,' which aligns with high-intensity intervals seen in rowing workouts. The category 'HIIT' is also relevant with a score of 0.7 because the workout format is described as 'Interval,' and the intensity level is 3 out of 3, indicating a high-intensity interval training structure. The presence of rock and high-energy music supports the high-intensity categorization. Other categories like 'Mat,' 'Pilates,' and 'Yoga' are excluded due to the lack of relevant indicators."
