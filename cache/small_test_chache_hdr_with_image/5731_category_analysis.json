  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Yoga' based on the description, which explicitly mentions 'yoga flow.' The term 'flow' often relates to a Vinyasa style of yoga, which emphasizes smooth transitions between poses, focusing on core engagement as highlighted in the description. A score of 0.8 reflects high confidence given these clear indications.\n\nAdditionally, 'Mat' was selected due to the metadata category tags like 'On The Mat, standard, on-the-mat' and the absence of any equipment usage in the workout description or the provided image. This suggests exercises performed on an exercise mat. The score is 0.6 because while 'mat' exercises are implied, the main focus is on yoga.\n\nOther categories such as 'Body weight' or 'Stretching' were considered but not selected as they don't fully encompass the primary yoga focus of the workout."
