  "vibesExplanation": "The workout title 'Consistent Effort Row' and description focusing on maintaining a consistent effort indicates a rhythmic activity characteristic of 'The Meditative Grind'. The rowing intervals between rhythms 20 to 24 and a low intensity promote a steady, repetitive motion, matching the meditative aspect of this vibe. The music from 'Rock low' and 'Global Hits', combined with tracks like 'It's Not My Time' and '(Don't Fear) The Reaper', add an uplifting, steady element that aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave', providing an elevated but controlled energy experience suitable for beginners. The focus on breath control in the category and workout type further supports these selected vibes. No elements suggest high-intensity or unpredictable variability, excluding more intense vibes like 'The Adrenaline Rush' or 'The Warrior Workout'. The confidence level is moderate due to the lack of specific music genre information."
