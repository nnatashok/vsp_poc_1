  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title \"Yoga Flow\" and description emphasize a flow sequence, which typically involves floor movements where a mat is essential. Additionally, the category \"On The Mat\" reinforces the requirement for a mat, and the image shows the person performing yoga on a mat. The confidence level is very high due to multiple references pointing to mat usage, specifically for yoga practice."
