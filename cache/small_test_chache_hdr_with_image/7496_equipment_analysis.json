  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is part of a Runner's Program and is described as a 'drive, standard, row' workout, strongly suggesting the primary use of a rowing machine. The high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format, along with the mention of 'max rhythm: 28,' further supports the need for a rowing machine, as these are key indicators in rowing workouts. The image also shows rowing equipment, indicating the central role of a rowing machine in this workout. The high confidence score is based on these explicit references to rowing in both the workout category and format."
