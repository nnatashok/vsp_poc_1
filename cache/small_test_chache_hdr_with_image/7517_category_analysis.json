  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Indoor rowing' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This selection is evident from the image showing a person rowing and the workout being described in intervals, which is typical of rowing workouts. The workout name, 'Running + Sprinting Pace Row,' also suggests a rowing focus. The presence of a rowing machine in the exercise is implied by the description of the rowing rhythm (Max rhythm: 28).\n\nThe secondary classification is 'HIIT' with a score of 0.7. This is due to the format of the workout being described as 'Intervals,' which aligns with high-intensity interval training. Additionally, the use of high-energy music and the workout type described as 'sweat' implies intensity consistent with HIIT.\n\nOther potential categories such as 'Running' and 'Mat' were excluded due to a lack of explicit evidence indicating those activities."
