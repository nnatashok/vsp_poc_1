  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Instructional: Drive Through Your Feet' focuses on 'proper foot placement and form with Nick while completing a legs-only drill.' This indicates a methodical approach emphasizing technique, which aligns strongly with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, scoring 0.8. The emphasis on instruction and form further supports this classification. Although the workout is a warm-up, its detailed focus on specific rowing techniques suggests a disciplined, structured session.\n\nThe playlist, including '1 Thing (Instrumental)' and '99 Red Balloons,' played from radio stations like 'Pop mid' and 'Global Hits,' along with a warm-up music genre, suggests an element of rhythm and continuity in the session. This justifies a secondary spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a score of 0.4, as the music likely aids in maintaining a continuous and smooth effort in rowing, though it is not the primary focus.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Soothing & Restorative,' 'Sport & Agility,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are less applicable due to the instructional, technique-focused nature of the workout."
