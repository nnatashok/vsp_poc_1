  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves rowing with intervals, which typically requires some coordination and understanding of rowing mechanics. The 'sweat' category suggests moderate complexity. Thus, it aligns with an Intermediate level. The presence of intervals indicates slightly increased complexity, justifying a higher Intermediate score.",
