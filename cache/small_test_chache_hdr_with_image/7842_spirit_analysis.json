  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout features elements that align with multiple workout spirits. The quick pace in the description suggests a **Flow & Rhythm** spirit, especially with dance and remix music choices that drive a continuous, music-driven pace. Thus, this spirit is a strong match at a score of 0.75.\n\nThe setting in Norway, along with the outdoor backdrop visible in the image, indicates an **Outdoor & Adventure** spirit. The natural environment is used as a part of the workout experience, meriting a score of 0.7.\n\nThe inclusion of varied intensity options with exercises like core-focused movements, squats, and lunges suggests a **High-Energy & Intense** component. The quick pace and the use of motivational, high-energy tracks contribute to this spirit, resulting in a score of 0.65.\n\n**Structured & Disciplined** was not chosen as the workout doesn't emphasize precision or methodical progression. **Soothing & Restorative** and **Sport & Agility** are not evident in the workout description or playlist."
