  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout, 'The Zen Flow,' was chosen due to the description indicating a focus on alignment and movement through the hips, hamstrings, and spine, which suggests a grounding and intentional experience. The term 'align yoga' implies a breath-centered and unhurried practice typical of 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The music described as 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' supports this classification by suggesting a calm, relaxing atmosphere suitable for such a vibe.\n\n'Only the Reboot Workout' is also relevant as the session is designed for post-row recovery, focusing on stretching the body right after an intense workout session, which aligns with a full-body refresh.\n\nFinally, 'The Meditative Grind' was assigned due to the session's duration and repetitive nature, typical of yoga workouts that emphasize zoning in and repetition. However, it scored slightly lower as the primary focus is on alignment and relaxation rather than endurance."
