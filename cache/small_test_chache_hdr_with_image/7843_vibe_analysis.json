  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Consistency Row' emphasizes maintaining a steady split through intervals, which suggests a repetitive and steady pacing, aligning well with 'The Meditative Grind.' The focus on consistent effort and breath control further supports this, earning a strong score of 0.75. The rock music playlist with tracks like 'Bad Medicine' and 'I Wanna Rock' adds an energizing, feel-good rhythm, contributing to 'The Endorphin Wave,' but the music's role is secondary to the workout's steady, controlled pace. The moderate intensity and structure suggest a slightly less intense emotional experience, hence a score of 0.65 for 'The Endorphin Wave.' Other vibes, like 'The Nightclub Workout,' are less relevant due to the lack of a party-like atmosphere or high-intensity music emphasis."
