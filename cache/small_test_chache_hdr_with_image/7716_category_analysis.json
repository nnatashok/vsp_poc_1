  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as 'Rhythm 30 HIIT Row,' clearly indicating a focus on HIIT with rowing components. The description mentions '1-minute intervals' and 'recovery,' typical elements of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), thus justifying a high score of 0.8 for the HIIT category. \n\nThe use of 'row' in the workout name and 'pressure on the footboards' implies a rowing exercise, reaffirming its primary activity as rowing. However, since the image depicts outdoor rowing, it slightly reduces the certainty for categorizing it purely as 'Indoor rowing,' resulting in a 0.75 score. \n\nThe metadata emphasizes rhythm and intensity level '3 out of 3,' supporting a high-intensity workout recognition. The absence of indoor-specific references in the picture and the outdoor scene may hint at real-time outdoor rowing but does not eliminate indoor rowing formats."
