  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Effort Focused Row', centers on maintaining a rhythm and controlled effort, indicative of the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.7). The emphasis on rhythm and coordination, as seen in phrases like 'maintain the same split' and 'control your effort', supports this classification. \n\nThe structured nature of maintaining specific rhythms and performing intervals suggests a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (score: 0.6), especially given the specific rhythm numbers and interval format.\n\nThe workout's low intensity level (1 out of 3) and its placement in the 'Breathe' category align with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit (score: 0.5), as it emphasizes a gentler, recovery-focused session. \n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the beginner fitness level requirement and the specified low intensity."
