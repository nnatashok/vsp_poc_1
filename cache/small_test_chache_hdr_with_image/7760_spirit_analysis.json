  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' due to the emphasis on control, slowing down rhythm, and the cool down nature as indicated by the title 'Go Low Cool-Down' and description. The music genre and playlist choices such as 'Chill low' and songs by Noel Gallagher and Bob Marley, known for their calming and relaxed tones, further support this classification with a high score of 0.9. \n\nThe spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm' is also present but to a slightly lesser extent. This is evidenced by the format description 'Reverse Climb' and the focus on maintaining a controlled rhythm, which suggests a continuous movement pattern, yielding a score of 0.6. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are not applicable due to the workout's low intensity and lack of structured protocol. The outdoor setting (image) is noted but not central to the workout's spirit."
