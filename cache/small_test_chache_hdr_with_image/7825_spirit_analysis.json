  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Climbing Intervals Warm-Up' has elements that suggest a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The description emphasizes climbing 'in rhythm,' indicating a pace and coordination likely driven by music, consistent with the rhythmic and fluid nature of this spirit. Songs such as 'In My Mind' and 'Show Me Love' further reinforce the rhythmic and engaging aspect, as these are widely recognized dance tracks that focus on maintaining a beat.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Climb' format and 'warm-up' nature suggest 'Structured & Disciplined' as another potential spirit. The workout is described as preparation for subsequent exercises, indicating a methodical approach.\n\nThe short duration (5 minutes) and warm-up category emphasize preparation rather than high intensity, excluding High-Energy & Intense. The absence of explicit restorative or soothing language and the focus on rhythm further confirm the absence of a Soothing & Restorative focus. The workout is indoors, excluding Outdoor & Adventure. Overall, 'Flow & Rhythm' is predominant, with 'Structured & Disciplined' as a secondary spirit."
