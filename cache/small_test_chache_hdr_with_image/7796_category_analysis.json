  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Climbing Intervals Row' indicates a rowing exercise, supported by the description mentioning '3', 2', and 1' intervals climbing from 22 to 26.' This reflects interval training typical of rowing workouts. Although there isn't explicit mention of indoor rowing, the structured interval design implies a controlled environment such as an indoor rowing machine, therefore, 'Indoor rowing' is assigned with a high score of 0.8.\n\nThe mention of 'Workout Type: breathe' suggests a focus on breathing techniques during the workout, likely to emphasize breath control within the intervals. This justifies the assignment of the 'Breathing exercises' category, albeit with a lower confidence score of 0.6, as the primary focus is rowing rather than solely breathing exercises.\n\nOther categories like 'HIIT' were considered due to the interval structure, but were excluded because the intensity level is described as 1 out of 3, indicating low intensity not characteristic of HIIT. The visual and exercise description aligns with the aforementioned categories."
