  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Racing Rock Row' is characterized by high-intensity elements, as indicated by phrases like 'rev your engine' and the inclusion of a high rhythm number (max rhythm: 34), which suggests a fast-paced, heart-pumping session. Additionally, the workout intensity level is 3 out of 3, further supporting it as a 'High-Energy & Intense' session, resulting in a strong score of 0.9 for this spirit. \n\nThe use of a 'classic rock playlist' and the focus on 'high rhythm numbers' also suggests the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, emphasizing coordination with music-driven pacing. Therefore, this spirit receives a score of 0.7. \n\nLastly, the format and category description, including terms like 'intervals', 'drive', and 'advanced fitness level', hint at elements of performance-based training and athleticism, aligning with 'Sport & Agility'. Thus, this spirit is moderately present with a score of 0.5. The visual of rowing on water subtly emphasizes agility but remains secondary to intensity and rhythm aspects."
