  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Hip-Opening Flow' promotes a deliberate, breath-centered practice as indicated by terms such as 'flow,' 'moving with Owen,' and 'bringing attention to mind and body.' This aligns strongly with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, reflecting a calming and intentional experience (score: 0.9). The music choice described as 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' further supports this vibe by creating a relaxed atmosphere.\n\nAdditionally, the session's aim to 'open your hips' and its gentle progression suits 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, emphasizing low-stress and total-body refreshment (score: 0.7).\n\nFinally, the restorative nature of the 'Hip-Opening Flow,' the soothing music, and the duration of over 21 minutes suggest elements of 'The Deep Recharge' vibe, promoting gentle movement and nervous system reset (score: 0.6). The absence of a specified intense music genre and the inclusive fitness level requirement confirm a calming, inclusive experience."
