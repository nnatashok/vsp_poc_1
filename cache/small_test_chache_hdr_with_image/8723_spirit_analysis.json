  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Steady Cool-Down' clearly indicates a focus on lowering the heart rate and soothing the body after exercise, classifying it under 'Soothing & Restorative' with high confidence (0.9). The term 'cool down' and the description about decreasing heart rate contribute to this classification.\n\nThe presence of a max rhythm and the inclusion of pop and global hits suggest a rhythmic, music-driven component, so 'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant with a strong score of 0.7. This indicates coordinated movement and a mind-body connection aspect.\n\nThe activity takes place 'along the Charles River,' which subtly includes elements of nature and exploration, warranting the 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification with a moderate score of 0.6. This contexts the workout in the natural environment, adding a serene and exploratory dimension.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the gentle, steady nature of the session, which emphasizes recovery over intensity."
