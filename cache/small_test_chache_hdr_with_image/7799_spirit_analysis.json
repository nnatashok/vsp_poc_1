  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout is primarily classified as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the explicit focus on maintaining specific rowing rhythms (22 and 24) and practicing rowing with eyes closed to enhance the rhythm and connection. The choice of music, such as 'The Devil Went Down To Georgia' and 'Tribute,' likely supports a steady, rhythmic flow, reinforcing this spirit. The mention of this being a 'cool down' emphasizes the secondary spirit of 'Soothing & Restorative,' as cooldowns are typically designed to aid recovery and relaxation. The short duration (5 minutes and 40 seconds) and low intensity further align with a restorative spirit. 'Structured & Disciplined' could be a consideration due to the interval format, but the overall focus on rhythm and cooling down outweighs a disciplined, high-intensity approach. Overall, the evidence strongly supports 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a supportive element of 'Soothing & Restorative.'"
