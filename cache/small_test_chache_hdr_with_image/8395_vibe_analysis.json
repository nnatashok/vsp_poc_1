  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Engagement + Stretch Cool-Down' features a steady rowing format with a focus on core engagement and stretching, suggesting a calming and repetitive nature typical of 'The Meditative Grind' (score: 0.7). The description indicating a 'cool down' and the presence of stretching aligns with characteristics of 'The Reboot Workout' (score: 0.7), which emphasizes a total body refresh. Additionally, the rhythmic and steady rowing could evoke 'The Endorphin Wave' (score: 0.5), which involves feel-good movement and an energy build-up. The rock music in the playlist, although unspecified in terms, provides a moderate level of intensity that supports this vibe. The analysis is made with moderately high confidence due to explicit indicators of intensity, format, and activity type given in the metadata."
