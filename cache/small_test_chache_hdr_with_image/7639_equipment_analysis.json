  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout \"Beginner Yoga Flow\" explicitly falls under the category \"On The Mat,\" indicating that a yoga mat is required, thus receiving a confidence score of 1.0. The description also mentions that yoga blocks are optional, which implies they may be used to assist with certain poses, so they are included with a moderate confidence of 0.5. The image supports this by showing a mat and blocks, however, blocks are stated as optional, reinforcing their auxiliary role in the workout."
