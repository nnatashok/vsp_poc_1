  "categoriesExplanation": "The metadata indicates a high-intensity rowing workout with references to 'exploding with power and speed,' suggesting a focus on rowing performance ('Indoor rowing'). The workout is classified as a 'drive' and 'power' session, and the music playlist being high-energy supports this. Additionally, the 'final 1-minute effort' implies interval training, a characteristic of HIIT workouts. Thus, categories 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 1 due to clear rowing focus, and 'HIIT' with a score of 0.7 due to interval training elements, have been selected."
