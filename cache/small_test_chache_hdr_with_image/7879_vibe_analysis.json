The description's emphasis on cooling down and preparing for the next day aligns well with 'The Reboot Workout', which focuses on refreshing the body with low-stress movements. The playlist's mellow, dance-oriented music complements a calming atmosphere. The workout's short duration and cool-down focus support these vibe choices. While 'The Meditative Grind' is chosen primarily for its grounded and steady nature, aligning with rowing endurance, 'The Reboot Workout' fits due to its focus on recovery.
