  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Pop Row' is characterized by a sprint pace with 90-second intervals followed by a 30-second push at max pace, indicating a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The use of pop and globally recognized high-energy hits such as 'Can't Hold Us' and 'Moves Like Jagger' supports this spirit, contributing to a high-confidence score of 0.9 for this category. The integration of music emphasizes continuous rhythmic motion, aligning with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, scoring 0.7. The interval format, mentioned in the description and the usage of a structured protocol (sprint intervals), suggests a 'Structured & Disciplined' approach, earning a score of 0.6. The workout intensity level of 3 out of 3 further supports these classifications. The advanced fitness level requirement and emphasis on driving pace provide strong signals for these spirits, with little indication of more relaxed or recovery-oriented spirits."
