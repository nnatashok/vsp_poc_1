  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout 'All in One Row' is clearly centered around rowing, as indicated by the name and the category (\"category: row\"). The description specifies a structured rowing session (with intervals), suggesting that a rowing machine or actual rowing equipment is necessary. The image further corroborates this by showing individuals actively rowing on water. This analysis leads to a very high confidence level (1.0) that a rowing machine is essential for this workout."
