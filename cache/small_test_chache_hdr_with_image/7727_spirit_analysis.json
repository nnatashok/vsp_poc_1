  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the workout aligns with \"Flow & Rhythm\" due to the emphasis on music and a smooth interval rowing style. The description mentions music-driven pacing, suggesting a continuous and rhythm-focused session, which is reinforced by the 60s/70s Rock and Global Hits playlist. This vibe supports a score of 0.85 for Flow & Rhythm.\n\n\"Soothing & Restorative\" is also relevant, as the workout is framed as low intensity (1 out of 3) with an emphasis on breath and setting intentions. These attributes cater to a more gentle and recovery-focused experience, thus justifying a score of 0.7.\n\n\"Outdoor & Adventure\" receives a moderate score of 0.5 due to the rowing activity being visually represented outdoors. While the data doesn't explicitly focus on outdoor exploration, the imagery suggests an open water setting contributing an adventurous element.\n\nOther spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Sport & Agility\" are not applicable as the workout is described as low intensity, and there is limited focus on sports-specific skills."
