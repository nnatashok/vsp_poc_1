  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The image and description suggest that the workout involves rowing, as it takes place on the Charles River with a rowing motion depicted. The category 'row' and 'steady' format reinforce that a rowing machine is highly likely to be required for land-based equivalents. The activity's nature as a 'cool down' implies a gentle, steady rhythm that matching water rowing or an indoor rowing machine would provide. Confidence is very high because these elements are explicitly linked to a rowing experience."
