  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Beginner Whole Body Strength' with a focus on being 'approachable' suggests a vibe centered around foundational strength. The category 'On The Mat' and suitability for all fitness levels underscore incremental improvement and attention to basics, aligning well with 'The Foundation Builder' vibe, scored at 0.85 for its strong match. The short duration of 15 minutes and gentle approach also suggest elements of 'The Reboot Workout,' aimed at a quick, refreshing full-body engagement, thus a score of 0.6. The inclusion of varying fitness levels indicates a possible element of structure and repetition, hinting at 'The Disciplined Grind,' albeit at a lower confidence of 0.4 due to less intensity. The indie and global hits music suggests a lighter, more accessible mood but does not strongly define any additional vibes."
