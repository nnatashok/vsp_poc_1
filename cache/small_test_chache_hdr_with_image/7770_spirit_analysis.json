  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the HIIT format and 1-minute intervals, indicating a high-intensity session (score 0.9). The description mentions a maximum rhythm of 34, and the intensity level is 3 out of 3, further supporting this classification. The presence of upbeat music such as 'Higher Love' by Kygo, known for its energizing qualities, aligns with a high-energy workout.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant because the workout takes place in Nord\u00e5svannet Bay, Norway, suggesting an exploration of natural landscapes (score 0.7). The imagery in the metadata reinforces this outdoor setting.\n\nLastly, 'Flow & Rhythm' is considered, albeit with a lower score (0.5), due to the playlist\u2019s pop and global hits, which may encourage a rhythmic and music-driven session. However, the primary focus on intensity means this is a secondary aspect. The workout lacks elements of technical precision or recovery focus, which excludes 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits."
