  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'HIIT Strength' suggests a vigorous and high-intensity session, characteristic of 'The Warrior Workout' vibe, with strength-based exercises that imply a primal energy and heart-pounding experience. The use of HIIT in the title strongly aligns with this classification, earning a score of 0.8 for its prominent alignment with the vibe.\n\nThe playlist and music genre, including tracks like 'Freedom' by Afrojack and 'Titanium' by David Guetta and Sia, suggest a strong beat and dance-party atmosphere, supporting a 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe. This vibe is further indicated by radio stations like Dance Mid, contributing to a score of 0.7. The energetic and euphoric qualities of the music reinforce this classification.\n\nGiven the duration and intensity description, other vibes such as 'The Groove Session' or 'The Endorphin Wave' were considered but excluded due to the explicit mention of HIIT and strength, which are more indicative of a high-intensity, beat-driven workout suitable for 'The Warrior Workout' rather than a more fluid or gradual energy build."
