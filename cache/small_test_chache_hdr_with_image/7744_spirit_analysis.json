  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' given its focus on explosive power, speed, and a high intensity level (3 out of 3). The description mentions 'explode with power and speed' and 'going all out', indicating a session that demands maximum effort. Furthermore, the playlist includes high-tempo and energetic tracks (such as 'I Can't Stop' by Flux Pavilion), which align with this energetic spirit. The confidence in this classification is high (0.9).\n\nThe workout is also 'Structured & Disciplined' due to its format and progression. It is part of a series ('Week 2 of 5'), suggesting a methodical approach with planned intensity increments. The inclusion of a specific rhythm cap and structure ('5-minute pieces' followed by a '1-minute effort') further supports this classification, although the score is slightly lower (0.7) due to less emphasis on technical precision compared to the intensity elements.\n\nNo significant elements suggest a 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' experience."
