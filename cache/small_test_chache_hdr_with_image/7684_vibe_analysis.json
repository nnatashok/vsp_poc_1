  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Granite State Challenge' has a highly competitive edge indicated by phrases like '1-minute challenge' and 'you and Mike versus the production crew,' which aligns with 'The Competitor' vibe. The short duration (1:50) and focus on 'maximum meters' suggest an intense, explosive effort representative of 'The Firestarter.' The high intensity level and format 'Power' imply a full-body, heart-racing experience consistent with 'The Adrenaline Rush.' The use of pop and motivational music, such as the 'Wannabe (Motiv 8 Dubslam Mix)' by the Spice Girls, adds to the engaging, upbeat nature of the workout. The advanced fitness level requirement underscores the competitive and intense nature of the session, reinforcing the chosen vibes."
