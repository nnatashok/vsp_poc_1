  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Time Under Tension Row' indicates elements of 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its focus on building cardio and endurance, along with the potential repetitive nature of rowing intervals. The setting along the Charles River further suggests a calming yet focused experience, suitable for zoning in and locking down into the rhythm of rowing, which aligns with a score of 0.8 due to the strong match. The use of intermediate indie alternative and global hits music hints at 'The Endorphin Wave,' as the playlist could enhance feel-good movement and a steady energy build, meriting a score of 0.7. Additionally, the rhythm-focused aspect of rowing at intervals and max rhythm of 28 could invoke a 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' sensation, emphasizing beat-driven endurance, resulting in a moderate match score of 0.6. The short duration and intensity level make highly intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' less applicable."
