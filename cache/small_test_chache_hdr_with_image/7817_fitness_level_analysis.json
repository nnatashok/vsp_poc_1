  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes rowing intervals, with four sets of 4-minute intervals followed by six sets of 45-second intervals. While the rhythm peaks at 30 strokes per minute, which requires some coordination, the overall rowing technique remains beginner to intermediate due to the presence of rest and moderate intensity cues. The Intermediate fitness level aligns with needing basic rowing knowledge to manage intervals effectively, but the general functionality of rowing is relatively simple, leading to a mixture of Beginner and Intermediate scores.",
