  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is named \"Bodyweight Strength\" and is described as focusing on core engagement and stability, which aligns with a focused and repetitive style, indicative of \"The Meditative Grind\" vibe, scoring 0.7. The tranquil setting overlooking the mountains in Norway, combined with the calm and steady nature of bodyweight exercises, suggests elements of \"The Zen Flow,\" scoring 0.6. The music playlist includes upbeat, dance-oriented tracks that suggest a potential groove element, hence a mild influence for \"The Groove Session\" scoring 0.5. The absence of high-intensity indicators confirms the exclusion of more explosive vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Firestarter.\" Since fitness levels span from beginners to advanced, this adds to the workout's inclusive and steady nature, supporting the selected vibes."
