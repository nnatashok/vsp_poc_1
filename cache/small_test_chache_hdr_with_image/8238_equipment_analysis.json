  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Technique Cool-Down\" and falls under the category of 'Cool Down, standard, row,' which strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine. The focus on technique further implies that rowing is central to this session. The image supports this by showing a person in a rowing position outdoors. Given this evidence, there's a very high confidence (0.8) that a rowing machine would be required for this workout, especially for those not rowing on water."
