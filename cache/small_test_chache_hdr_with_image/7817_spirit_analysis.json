  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout '80's Fun Summer Row' is characterized by both energetic music and structured intervals, suggesting a blend of 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'High-Energy & Intense' spirits. The playlist of classic 80's hits implies a music-driven, rhythmic experience (scoring 0.7 in 'Flow & Rhythm'). The description mentions 4-minute and 45-second intervals, pointing to a more dynamic and engaging session (0.6 in 'High-Energy & Intense'). Additionally, the workout is described as 'relax and have fun,' which slightly indicates a 'Soothing & Restorative' aspect, reflected in a lower score of 0.4. The lack of extreme intensity and the fun, accessible playlist reduce the likelihood of a purely intense classification. The workout's intermediate level and emphasis on enjoyment and rhythm support a balanced mix of energies."
