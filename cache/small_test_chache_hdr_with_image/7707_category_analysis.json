  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Indoor rowing' due to the repeated mention of rowing at a steady rhythm. The word 'row' appears prominently in the title 'Rhythm 18 Row' and description, indicating that rowing is the central activity, supporting the high score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Breathing exercises' category is included with a score of 0.6 because the workout type is explicitly labeled as 'breathe' and 'breathe' is in the metadata category. This suggests a focus on breathing techniques alongside rowing, although it is secondary to the rowing itself.\n\nThe workout does not fit into categories like 'Yoga' or 'Meditation' because it is an active exercise focused on rowing and breathing, not on static poses or mental awareness practices alone. The visual indication of rowing equipment further supports the categorization under rowing activities."
