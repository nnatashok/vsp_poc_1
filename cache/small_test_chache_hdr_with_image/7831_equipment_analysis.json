  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly named \"Cardio Intervals Row\" and categorized under \"row,\" which indicates a focus on rowing. The use of intervals and rhythm further suggests a structured rowing workout typically performed on a rowing machine. Although the image shows outdoor rowing, the context and metadata imply that an indoor rowing machine is necessary for the intended workout format. Therefore, a rowing machine is identified with very high confidence."
