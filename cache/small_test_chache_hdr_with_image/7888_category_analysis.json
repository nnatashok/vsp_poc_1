  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is titled \"Power Flow,\" with a description that includes a location overlooking water and mountains in Norway. The use of the term \"power flow\" and mention of \"yoga blocks optional\" strongly indicates a Yoga workout. The yoga category is further supported by the image showing a pose typical in yoga practice. The mention of the workout being on a mat, alongside the flow style, also suggests a Mat category, but yoga is more central. The playlist featuring chill, downtempo music also aligns with yoga sessions. Therefore, Yoga is assigned a high score (0.9) as the main category, with Mat complementing it with a lower score (0.5). The high confidence level reflects clear indicators from titles and visuals."
