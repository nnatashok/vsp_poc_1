  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is supported by the title 'Steady Cool-Down' and the description which emphasizes a steady pace along the Charles River, relaxation with Taylor Swift's music, and a focus on cool-down activity rather than intense exertion. The format being 'steady' and the workout type categorized explicitly as a 'cool down' further underscores the restorative nature, promoting recovery and relaxation.\n\nThe secondary classification is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.7. The presence of music, particularly Taylor Swift's known soothing and rhythmic tracks ('Lover' and 'Love Story'), indicates a workout that incorporates flow and rhythm, enhancing the mind-body connection and making the exercise experience more harmonious. The mention of rowing along a scenic river supports a rhythmic, flowing movement pattern, though less intensive in nature.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility', are excluded due to the lack of any indicators of intensity, structured discipline, or agility-focused training."
