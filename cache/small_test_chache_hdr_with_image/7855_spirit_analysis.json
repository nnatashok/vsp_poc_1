  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Express Bootcamp HIIT Row,' clearly promotes a high-intensity, high-energy session. It includes characteristics of HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training), emphasized by the 50-second and 10-second interval structures at higher rhythms of 26 and 32. The advanced fitness level requirement and intensity level of 3 out of 3 further reinforce this to be a 'High-Energy & Intense' workout, meriting a score of 0.9. \n\nAdditionally, with intervals focusing on 'rhythm' and the playlist consisting of pop and global hits, there is a noticeable element of 'Flow & Rhythm.' The music-driven pacing helps in connecting movement with rhythm, supporting a score of 0.6.\n\n'Sport & Agility' is reflected by the rowing aspect combining athleticism and coordination with high speed rowing strokes, thus carrying a score of 0.5. The outdoor rowing image supports this, but as the workout focus is not specific to sports skills, it's a secondary spirit."
