  "categoriesExplanation": "The main category assigned is 'Mat' because the workout is specifically described as a core strengthening session on the mat, with 'Yoga blocks optional,' strongly indicating floor exercises. The term 'On The Mat' further confirms this categorization, and its central presence in the workout (score: 0.8).\n\nThe second category is 'Body weight' as the workout involves core strengthening, which typically utilizes body-weight exercises. Although not explicitly stated, the absence of any mention of weights or equipment in the metadata suggests reliance on body weight (score: 0.6).\n\nOther categories like 'Weight workout' or 'Pilates' were excluded due to lack of relevant indicators. The confidence in these classifications is high due to clear signals in both title and description, despite the outdoor setting in the image, which doesn't change the workout's nature."
