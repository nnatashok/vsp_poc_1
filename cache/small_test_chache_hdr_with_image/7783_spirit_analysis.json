  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's title, \"Welcome to Norway Flow,\" explicitly indicates a focus on flow, suggesting smooth and continuous movement, which aligns with the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit. The description highlights a \"core-focused flow\" and the \"serene surroundings\" in Norway, which reinforce this spirit. The use of chill and downtempo music further supports the smooth, rhythmic nature of the workout, justifying a strong score of 0.9.\n\nThe mention of \"serene surroundings\" and relaxing music aligns with the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit. Although the core focus introduces an element of structure, the overall ambiance suggests relaxation, providing a solid match with a score of 0.8.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is suggested by the setting in Norway, a new destination with potential exploration and adventure elements. However, since the workout is primarily mat-based, this spirit is secondary but still relevant, therefore scoring 0.7. Other spirits are excluded as they don't match the focus on flow and relaxation."
