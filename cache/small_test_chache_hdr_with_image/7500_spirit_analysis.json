  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit for this workout is \"High-Energy & Intense\" with a score of 0.9. This is strongly indicated by the interval format and the maximum rhythm of 28, which suggests a fast-paced, high-intensity workout designed to simulate 400m repeats. The explicit lyrics and pop/rock playlist further contribute to an energizing and adrenaline-pumping atmosphere. \n\nThe secondary spirit is \"Structured & Disciplined,\" scoring 0.7. The workout's intention to \"compliment your running training\" shows a methodical approach, particularly for advanced users, and the resemblance to 400m repeats implies a structured and technically focused session designed to enhance running performance.\n\nOther spirits like \"Flow & Rhythm\" or \"Soothing & Restorative\" were excluded due to the high intensity and driven nature, which are less about relaxation or seamless movements, and more about pushing limits and achieving specific training goals."
