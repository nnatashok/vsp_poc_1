  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'Indoor rowing' with a high confidence score (0.8), as indicated by the description mentioning rhythm and intervals, common in rowing sessions, and supported by an image showing rowing equipment. The gradual climb in rhythm suggests a structured workout typical of rowing, helping remind users of correct form. 'Mat' is considered with a moderate score (0.5) because the workout is described as a warm-up, which can include various aerobic and stretching exercises typically done on a mat. However, there is no specific indication of floor exercises, hence the uncertainty. Other categories like 'HIIT' or 'Stretching' are less applicable due to lack of intense intervals or explicit stretching focus."
