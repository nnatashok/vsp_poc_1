  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is characterized by its high intensity and structured approach. The description emphasizes 'holding a sprint pace during longer intervals' and 'pushing ahead to your max effort,' which are key indicators of a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The music playlist, featuring energetic rock tracks, further supports this classification, promoting a high-energy atmosphere. The format is clearly interval-based with an intensity level of 3 out of 3, suggesting a vigorous session aimed at advanced users.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also relevant due to the 'interval' format and the categorization under 'Drive, standard, row,' indicating a methodical, training-focused approach. The workout's alignment with a specific \"Week 3 of 4\" schedule implies a progressive structure, supporting this spirit. Therefore, both spirits are suitable, with a high confidence level in this analysis."
