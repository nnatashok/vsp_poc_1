  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Core Strength\" is likely characterized by the \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit due to the use of energetic music from artists like Ed Sheeran and Disclosure, and the presence of global hits, which suggest a stimulating environment. The description mentions \"ignite your core\" and \"quick and efficient,\" emphasizing intensity and effort, leading to a score of 0.7.\n\nThe \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit is also relevant, as the workout focuses on core strengthening with clear guidance, implying methodical execution and a structured approach. Yoga blocks being optional suggests a level of precision, warranting a score of 0.6.\n\n\"Flow & Rhythm\" receives a moderate score (0.4) due to the influence of the music described, but it's not the workout's main focus, as it emphasizes strength. The use of dance music may provide some rhythmic elements, yet the primary intent appears more strength-oriented.\n\nThe image of the outdoor setting contributes to a dynamic feel but does not strongly impact the main spirits identified."
