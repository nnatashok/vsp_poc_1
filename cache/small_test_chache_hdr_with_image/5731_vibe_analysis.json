  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Core Flow' emphasizes a yoga flow with core engagement, suggesting a vibe of 'The Zen Flow' due to the focus on intentional and breath-centered movement typical of yoga practices. The backdrop of the mountains in Colorado enhances this grounding atmosphere. The chill and downtempo music further supports this relaxed and intentional vibe, leading to a high confidence score of 0.8.\n\nThe 'Meditative Grind' vibe is also appropriate due to the repetitious nature of a yoga flow, aiming to engage the core consistently. The music and serene environment align with this vibe, thus receiving a score of 0.7.\n\nLastly, 'The Groove Session' is considered due to the artist selection and remixes like those by Gryffin, which add a fluid and expressive musical layer, earning it a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nThe combination of a short duration and consistent core emphasis in a scenic location supports these vibes, with particular emphasis on meditative and flow aspects."
