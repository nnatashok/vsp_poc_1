  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Effort Focused Row' is centered on maintaining a consistent split and controlling effort, which suggests a repetitive and focused experience typical of 'The Meditative Grind.' The use of terms like 'intervals' and a low intensity level supports this vibe, scoring a high 0.8.\n\nThe music selections, including tracks like 'Levels' by Avicii, imply an energetic and feel-good movement experience, which aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave.' The energy from the playlists and the music genres 'Dance mid, Global Hits' provide a steady but elevated energy, warranting a score of 0.6.\n\nLastly, the incorporation of pop and dance tracks might lend an element of the 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe. Though not overwhelmingly strong, the beat-driven music provides a hint of rhythm-driven power, giving it a score of 0.4.\n\nOther potential vibes were excluded due to the lack of high-intensity or competitive elements in the workout, maintaining focus on controlled and repetitive effort."
