Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration of 5 minutes and 49 seconds and the classification as a 'cool down' suggest a very light exertion level. Steady rhythm rowing to music is low-intensity, suited for recovery, firmly placing it in the 'Light' category. The mention of rowing could suggest mild cardiovascular effort, slightly nudging towards 'Moderate,' but primarily 'Light' is accurate.",
