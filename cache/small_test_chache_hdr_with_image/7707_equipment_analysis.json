  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata, including the name 'Rhythm 18 Row' and the description where participants are instructed to 'row steadily at a rhythm 18,' strongly indicates that a rowing machine is required. The exercise involves rowing, as evidenced by the categorization of 'row.' The presence of a person rowing in the image further supports this. Hence, the confidence that a rowing machine is necessary is very high, at 0.9."
