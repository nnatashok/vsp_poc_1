  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout strongly aligns with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to the use of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and advanced fitness level requirement. The intensity level being '3 out of 3' underscores a focus on pushing limits and delivering a heart-pumping session. The title 'Peppy HIIT Row' and the description mentioning bursts of 'energy' further support this classification.\\n\\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant, indicated by the workout taking place 'along the shores of Hanover.' This outdoor setting likely adds an adventurous element to the exercise beyond the typical indoor rowing session, suggesting a connection to nature and environmental exploration.\\n\\nLastly, 'Flow & Rhythm' earns consideration due to the specific references to 'music' and a playlist featuring rhythmic and high-energy 90s pop punk music. The structured intervals (30 and 60 seconds) and rhythm-driven format potentially contribute to a strong mind-body connection during the workout. This spirit receives a moderate score reflecting its secondary importance compared to the high-energy focus."
