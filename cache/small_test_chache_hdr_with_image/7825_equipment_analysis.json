  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, titled \"Climbing Intervals Warm-Up,\" is associated with the category 'row' which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. The format of the workout being 'Climb' could metaphorically relate to intervals that mimic climbing inside a rowing session. Furthermore, the image details reinforce this by showing a person on a rowing skiff, confirming the rowing setup. Therefore, a rowing machine is identified as the necessary equipment with very high confidence (0.9)."
