  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' indicates a focus on power and technical prowess associated with rowing. The 'climbing interval' aspect hints at variable intensities and possibly complex rowing strokes, leaning towards a more advanced technique. However, given the 'standard' categorization of this workout, the overall complexity does not reach the expert level, but requires good coordination and awareness, making it intermediate to advanced.",
