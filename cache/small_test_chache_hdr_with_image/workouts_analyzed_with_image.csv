The setting along the Charles River adds a natural, bold element. Dance-oriented playlist with high-energy tracks like 'Give Me Everything' and 'Show Me Love' aligns with 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe, though to a lesser extent given the primary focus on driving intensity rather than a dance atmosphere. The 'Meditative Grind' vibe is evident in the 21-minute duration on a rowing format, suggesting a repetitive, endurance-focused session. High confidence in 'The Warrior Workout' due to explicit intensity and energy cues, while 'The Nightclub Workout' and 'The Meditative Grind' have moderate scores reflecting their supporting roles.""}}"
