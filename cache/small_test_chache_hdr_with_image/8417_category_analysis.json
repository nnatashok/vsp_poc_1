  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout 'Upper Body Strength with Bands' is best categorized under 'Body weight' and 'Mat'. The use of a resistance band suggests a focus on body weight exercises since the band adds resistance without additional weights, which aligns with the 'Body weight' category. This is supported by the title and description emphasizing upper body strengthening. The setting on a mat as shown in the image aligns with the metadata category 'On The Mat', reinforcing the inclusion of the 'Mat' category. These indicators together support assigning 'Body weight' a score of 0.9 due to its strong presence as a defining feature of the workout, and 'Mat' a score of 0.7 due to the contextual setting."
