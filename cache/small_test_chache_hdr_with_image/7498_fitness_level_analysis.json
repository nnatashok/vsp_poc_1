  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This workout requires rowing with a steady rhythm, which can be managed by beginners due to its straightforward nature. The reference to 'breathe' and low rhythms suggests a focus on maintaining a consistent pace rather than technical rowing maneuvers, supporting a Beginner classification. The Intermediate score reflects that some coordination is necessary to maintain form over the interval duration, but it remains largely accessible.",
