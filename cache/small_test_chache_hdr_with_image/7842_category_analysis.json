  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily categorized as 'Mat' with a high confidence score of 0.8. This is supported by both the category ('On The Mat') and the presence of a mat in the image, indicating that exercises are performed on the ground. The inclusion of core exercises, squats, and lunges in the description suggests a body weight workout, justifying its secondary classification under 'Body weight' with a score of 0.7. The presence of optional yoga blocks suggests a focus on support and stability, common in mat exercises. The high-energy playlist complements the quick-paced nature of the workout but doesn't influence the categorization significantly. Other potential categories such as 'Pilates' or 'HIIT' were excluded due to a lack of specific indicators of Pilates-type or high-intensity interval training."
