  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Indoor rowing' due to the focus on rowing, indicated by the title 'Weekly Stories Row' and details such as 'Row with Nick,' 'Max rhythm: 28,' and 'Format: Interval.' The description confirms rowing as the central activity. A playlist of rock and metal music suggests a rhythmic, energetic workout, consistent with the rowing category. The intensity level (2 out of 3) further supports this classification. \n\nThe minor inclusion of 'Stretching' with a score of 0.19 is speculative, based on the possibility of warm-up or cool-down activities typically accompanying rowing sessions, though not explicitly mentioned. The outdoor rowing setting, as evidenced by the image, confirms the rowing category but does not directly suggest any other specific workout type. The rock and metal music playlist and informal storytelling aspect emphasize a dynamic, engaging rowing experience, reinforcing the 'Indoor rowing' classification with high confidence."
