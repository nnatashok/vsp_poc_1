  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified predominantly as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the focus on elevating the heart rate through five 2-minute intervals. The use of a rock playlist, described as 'Mid-intensity, Global Hits,' supports a high-energy ambiance, with a confidence score of 0.75. The rhythm and interval format also contribute to a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, earning a 0.7 score, as the workout involves planned segmentations (2-minute intervals) with specified rhythms of 26 and 28. The inclusion of a rock music playlist and the focus on maintaining specific beats per minute add a slight 'Flow & Rhythm' aspect, scored at 0.3, though the structure and intensity dominate the workout's character. Overall, the cues for intensity and structure are strong, while rhythmic elements are secondary."
