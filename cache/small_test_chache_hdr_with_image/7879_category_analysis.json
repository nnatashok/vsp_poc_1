  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout metadata explicitly mentions terms such as 'cool down' and 'row' under the category, suggesting a rowing activity. Additionally, the presence of 'steady' format indicates a controlled and consistent pace characteristic of rowing, which supports the classification of 'Indoor rowing' with high confidence (score: 0.9). Despite the workout being an outdoor session, the rowing technique aligns closely with indoor rowing exercises. The visual further confirms a rowing context.\n\nThe mention of 'cooling your body down' and 'reinforcing technique' implies elements of relaxation and posture adjustment typical for a cool-down, aligning partly with 'Stretching' activities. However, because stretching isn't the primary focus, it receives a moderate score of 0.6. Other categories like HIIT, Pilates, or Treadmill are not suitable due to lack of relevant indicators in the metadata."
