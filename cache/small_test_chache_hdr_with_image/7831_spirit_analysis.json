  "spiritsExplanation": "The \"Cardio Intervals Row\" workout is primarily categorized as \"High-Energy & Intense\" due to explicit references to elevating the heart rate and the description's emphasis on getting sweaty and working through intervals. The assigned intensity level of 2 out of 3 further suggests a vigorous workout pace. The music playlist, featuring high-tempo tracks like 'Party Rock Anthem' and 'I Love It', supports this high-energy designation. The inclusion of intermediate fitness requirements also points towards a demanding session, influencing the strong score of 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, the spirit of \"Flow & Rhythm\" is significant with a score of 0.7. The mention of \"shifting in rhythm\" and the use of dance and global hits in the playlist highlights the smooth transition and rhythmic nature of the intervals, complementing the continuous movement aspect of this spirit.\n\nOther spirits, like \"Structured & Disciplined\" or \"Soothing & Restorative,\" were less relevant due to the workout's focus on intensity and rhythm rather than technical precision or relaxation."
