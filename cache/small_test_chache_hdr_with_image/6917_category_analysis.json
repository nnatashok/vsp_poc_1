  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is prominently titled \"Yoga Flow,\" which directly suggests it's a Yoga session. The term 'flow' is commonly associated with Yoga, emphasizing a series of connected poses. The image of the participant performing an asana in a park supports the classification as Yoga. The workout description mentioning \"flow\" and \"on-the-mat\" also aligns with Yoga, further supported by the channel categorization \"On The Mat.\" The music playlist, described as chill and downtempo, complements a typical Yoga session ambiance, supporting relaxation and flow. Therefore, a high confidence score of 0.9 is given to Yoga.\n\nThe \"On The Mat\" tag and exercise mat shown in the image also suggest mat-based exercises, leading to a Mat category classification with a score of 0.7. While Mat exercises can include other activities like Pilates, the explicit mention and visual cues strongly highlight Yoga as the primary focus."
