  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is named 'Learn and Burn Row' and involves rowing at a steady rhythm. The metadata explicitly categorizes the workout as 'row,' indicating the central use of a rowing machine. The description suggests consistent rowing at rhythm 22, which would typically be performed on a rowing machine. The image further depicts a rowing activity, although on water, this context aligns closely with indoor rowing machine workouts. Thus, the rowing machine is identified as the required equipment with very high confidence."
