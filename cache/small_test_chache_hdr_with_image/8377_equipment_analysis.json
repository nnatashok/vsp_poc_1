  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled 'Core Positioning Row' and the description 'bring your stroke back to basics' strongly indicate that a rowing machine is required. The categories assigned to the workout include 'row', which aligns directly with the use of rowing equipment. Additionally, the image provided shows a person in a rowing position on the water, further suggesting that the workout emphasizes rowing technique. Therefore, I have assigned a very high confidence score of 0.9 for the rowing machine as the required equipment."
