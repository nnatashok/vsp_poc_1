  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Post-Row Pilates' session, with a category of 'On The Mat,' clearly indicating the need for a Mat. Pilates often involves floor exercises, which further supports the use of a mat. The confidence level is very high at 0.9, as both the description and category strongly suggest the presence of a mat. The image also shows the use of a mat, reinforcing this conclusion. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata."
