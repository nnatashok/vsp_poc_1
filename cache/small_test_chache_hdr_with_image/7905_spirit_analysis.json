  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Bodyweight Strength' emphasizes core engagement and stability, aligning with a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit due to the focus on specific strength-building techniques. The use of a structured strength format suggests methodical progression (score: 0.7). 'Outdoor & Adventure' is strongly reflected in the lush Norwegian mountain setting depicted in the image and mentioned in the description, enhancing the adventurous and natural feel of the session (score: 0.8). The playlist, featuring upbeat and rhythmic tracks like 'Stay (Petit Biscuit Remix)' and 'Big Energy,' suggests a 'Flow & Rhythm' component, as these tracks can guide the pace and movement coordination, though the primary focus remains on strength (score: 0.6). The absence of a specific instructor or personalized guidance does not strongly indicate other spirits. Overall, the workout embodies a blend of structured training and an outdoor adventure atmosphere."
