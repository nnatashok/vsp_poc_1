  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Pyramid Quiz Row' is classified predominantly as 'Flow & Rhythm' with a high score of 0.9 due to the emphasis on rhythm, as indicated by the description 'climb up and down in rhythm' and a pyramid format that supports flow. The music choice, including light and fun songs by The B-52's, further supports a rhythmic and engaging experience. \n\n'Soothing & Restorative' is assigned a score of 0.7, as the intensity is low (level 1 out of 3) and categorized under 'breathe', implying a gentle focus on breath work and relaxation.\n\nFinally, 'Outdoor & Adventure' receives a moderate score of 0.5. The image and setting in an outdoor environment partially support this spirit, although it's less emphasized in the workout metadata. The quiz element adds a playful, mentally engaging aspect, correlating with an adventurous spirit without being the primary focus."
