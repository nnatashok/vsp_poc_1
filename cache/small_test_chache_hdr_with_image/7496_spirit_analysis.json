  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to several clear indicators. The description highlights 'high intensity intervals' and 'sprint track workout,' both suggesting a focus on maximum effort and cardiovascular challenge, supported by an intensity level of 3 out of 3. The playlist features upbeat, energetic tracks like 'Titanium' and 'Confident,' which further amplify the high energy.\n\nThe workout is also 'Structured & Disciplined,' as it follows a specific High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) format. The reference to a 'Runner's Program' suggests a level of methodical progression aimed at improving performance, alongside the structured nature of interval training.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the workout's clear emphasis on intensity and structure rather than continuous movement patterns or outdoor exploration."
