  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is a bodyweight strength session, categorizing it under 'On The Mat' and 'standard', indicating a consistent, repetitive structure typical of 'The Meditative Grind'. The choice of music, featuring dance mixes and global hits with songs by artists like Khalid and Sia, suggests a beat-driven environment that aligns with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse'. The location in Seville, Spain adds an atmospheric quality, supporting a meditative grind with a rhythmic infusion. The inclusion of music tracks specifically noted as 'Club Mix' and 'Club Radio Mix' further underscores the rhythmic and engaging elements of the workout, matching the chosen vibes. The lack of specified instructor may focus more on the exercises and music interplay, enhancing a meditative, immersive experience."
