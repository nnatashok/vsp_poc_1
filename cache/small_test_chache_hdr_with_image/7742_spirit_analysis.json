  "spiritsExplanation": "The spirit 'Outdoor & Adventure' is strongly present due to the emphasis on climbing and rowing on Lake Tahoe, coupled with a rock playlist that enhances the adventurous atmosphere (score: 0.9). The description mentioning \"climb at altitude\" aligns with an exploratory and environmental challenge typical of this spirit.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is evident given the workout type labeled as \"sweat\" and an intensity level of 2 out of 3, combined with the energetic rock playlist featuring bands like Blue \u00d6yster Cult and Twisted Sister, which supports a vigorous exercise experience (score: 0.6).\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is moderately represented through the continuous rowing movement and the music-driven pacing suggested by the max rhythm of 26 and the structured song setlist (score: 0.5).\n\nOther spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are less applicable due to the focus on intensity and the dynamic, relaxed outdoor setting."
