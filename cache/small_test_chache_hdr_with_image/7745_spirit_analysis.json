  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is characterized by high intensity and explosive efforts, as indicated by the description terms 'explode with power and speed' and 'going all out.' The focus on power and speed aligns closely with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, justifying a strong score of 0.9. Additionally, the mention of week-based progression (Week 3 of 5) and an advanced user fitness level hint at a 'Sport & Agility' spirit, scoring 0.7, as it suggests a competitive or performance-oriented session. The use of dance and global hits for music suggests a rhythmic component, meriting a minor 'Flow & Rhythm' classification with a score of 0.4, as it may support a continuous workout flow. The set intensity level and structured timeline reinforce the primary spirits of high energy and sports-like precision."
