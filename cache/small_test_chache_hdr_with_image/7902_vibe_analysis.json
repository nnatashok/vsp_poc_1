  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe, 'The Meditative Grind,' was chosen due to the rowing format, which often involves repetitive motion and is typically associated with endurance and focus. The metadata supports this with descriptors like 'interval' for the format and 'standard, row' under category. The playlist with rock and metal music brings a strong rhythmic and motivational element, aligning with this vibe, and contributes to a steady, grind-like experience often seen in rowing routines.\n\n'Rage Session' was also considered due to the intensity and type of music (e.g., 'Chop Suey!' by System Of A Down and 'Bodies' by Drowning Pool), often associated with powerful, energetic workouts that may evoke a sense of aggression or intensity. This matches the interval nature and intermediate fitness level requirement, providing an explosive edge, though it is less prominent than the grinding rhythm of rowing.\n\nThe confidence level is relatively high because the metadata and selection of music strongly suggest these vibes. Other vibes like 'The Endorphin Wave' were considered but excluded due to lack of terms indicating a build or elevation in energy typical for that vibe."
