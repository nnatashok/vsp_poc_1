  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'legs-only drill' with an emphasis on foot placement during a 'warm-up' session. The category 'row' and the image of a person using a rowing machine both indicate the need for a rowing machine. These elements together lead to a very high confidence that a rowing machine is required for this workout, thus assigning a confidence score of 1.0."
