  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Runner's Program #9 of 9' is characterized by interval rowing, a repetitive and rhythm-focused activity, aligning it closely with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, scoring 0.75 due to its heart rate elevation and consistent pace set by the music. The intervals and rock playlist create a steady and engaging atmosphere, suitable for sustaining effort over 21 minutes.\n\nAdditionally, it matches 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe with a score of 0.65, because of the 'Sweat' category, format of intervals, and rock music. These elements contribute to a feel-good, energetic experience, which gradually builds endorphins through sustained exertion. The intermediate fitness requirement also supports a slightly challenging yet satisfying session. \n\nOther vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' are excluded due to low intensity and absence of high explosiveness or primal energy, indicated by the moderate 2 out of 3 intensity level."
