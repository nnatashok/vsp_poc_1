  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Core Flow' prominently suggests the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a high score of 0.9. The title and description highlight a 'yoga flow,' emphasizing smooth, continuous movements associated with this spirit. The use of downtempo and chill music, typical of flow workouts, supports this. The setting 'in front of the mountains in Colorado' suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' element with a score of 0.6. This natural environment adds an exploratory, adventurous quality to the session. The focus on 'core engagement' and a relaxing atmosphere implied by the music genre contributes to a 'Soothing & Restorative' aspect, scoring 0.6, suggesting a mild meditative and calming experience throughout the workout. The structured nature of typical core workouts is less emphasized, hence other spirits such as 'Structured & Disciplined' are not selected."
