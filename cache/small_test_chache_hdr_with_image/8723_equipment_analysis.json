  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video metadata indicates a cool-down session titled 'Steady Cool-Down' along the Charles River, tagged with 'row.' This suggests rowing activity, which is closely associated with using a rowing machine. The image of a person rowing reinforces this. Although it\u2019s an outdoor scene, in a video context, especially labeled with 'row,' it generally implies equipment like a rowing machine for indoor use. Hence, a confidence score of 0.9 is justified for a rowing machine being required."
