  "spiritsExplanation": "The title and description emphasize a 'cool-down' process with steady rowing and stretching, indicating a restorative nature. The use of phrases like 'steady row' and 'stretch your hamstrings' suggests a focus on relaxation and recovery, pointing strongly to a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The inclusion of music genres like 'rock low' and 'global hits', especially the song 'Knockin' On Heaven's Door', further aids a calming ambiance, supporting this classification with a score of 0.9 due to explicit restorative indicators. Additionally, the rowing component indicates a rhythmic motion, aligning well with 'Flow & Rhythm', though the presence of pauses suggests the primary focus is on recovery. Thus, 'Flow & Rhythm' receives a secondary score of 0.6. The outdoor glacier image adds a potential 'Outdoor & Adventure' feel, but since the focus is not explicitly on environmental exploration, it's excluded. The overall confidence level is high at 0.85 due to the specific terminology used."
