  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is an interval rowing session with a max rhythm of 30. The execution of interval training involves maintaining proper rowing form, which can be moderately complex. Given that the workout is classified as 'Intermediate' for users, there is a strong alignment with Intermediate technique difficulty (0.7). The presence of short intervals suggests that some coordination and body awareness are needed, justifying a weaker alignment with Advanced (0.4). Beginner alignment is minimal due to the coordination required in maintaining the rhythm and technique.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 21-minute duration with a workout intensity level marked as 2 out of 3 suggests a moderately high energy expenditure. The interval format typically increases effort due to shorter rest periods and sustained exertion. This aligns strongly with Challenging effort difficulty (0.8). The description indicates high intensity ('turn up the volume and intensity'), enhancing the effort demands, while also maintaining a strong connection with Moderate effort (0.6).",
