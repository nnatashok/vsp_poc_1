  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Indoor rowing' due to the mention of rowing in the workout name ('Consistency Row') and the description indicating sets of intervals, which are common in rowing workouts. The name itself and the consistent split imply rowing activity, particularly as it involves intervals within a 5-minute block. Therefore, the score for 'Indoor rowing' is high at 0.9, reflecting strong presence based on explicit metadata indicators.\\n\\n'Breathing exercises' is included with a score of 0.6 due to the tag 'breathe' in the workout type. Although the primary activity is rowing, the emphasis on breathing may be a secondary focus, indicated by the category tag, and suggests that there are elements of controlled breathing involved. This earns a moderate score since the main activity is clearly rowing, but breathing is a noticeable component.\\n\\nOther categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Mat' were excluded as there was no indication of these elements in the metadata or image. The 'Weight workout' was also not relevant given the lack of any resistance training mention."
