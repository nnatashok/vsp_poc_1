Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 16 minutes and 24 seconds limits the overall energy expenditure, and its classification as a 'flow' suggests consistent, gentle movements rather than intense bursts of activity. Therefore, the effort required aligns strongly with a Light difficulty level. There is minimal alignment with Moderate due to the possibility of continuous movement over 16 minutes requiring more than minimal effort, but it's clearly not physically demanding.",
