  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Racing Rock Row' is set to a classic rock playlist featuring high-energy hits like 'Detroit Rock City' and 'I Wanna Rock,' which aligns well with an 'Endorphin Wave' vibe due to its elevated energy and steady build, scoring 0.8. The emphasis on achieving high rhythm numbers and the format being intervals suggest a repetitive and focused nature typical of 'The Meditative Grind' at 0.7. The 'Warrior Workout' vibe is supported by the description's invitation to 'rev your engine' and the high-intensity level, but it's slightly less dominant, thus scoring 0.6. Overall, the combination of driving rock music and advanced intensity level indicate a strong motivational vibe with high confidence at 0.8."
