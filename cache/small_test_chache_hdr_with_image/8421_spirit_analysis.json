  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Core Flow' and described as a 'heat-building flow' strongly suggests the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The use of the term 'flow' indicates a smooth, continuous movement pattern. The inclusion of a yoga block, often used to enhance balance and fluidity in poses, further supports this classification. The duration and playlist, featuring chill and downtempo music like 'Green Light' and 'Nightcall (Breakbot Remix),' reinforce the rhythmic and flowing nature of the session, justifying a high score of 0.9 for 'Flow & Rhythm'.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant due to the calming music choices, albeit in a secondary role, leading to a moderate score of 0.6. \n\nFinally, the outdoor setting, visible in the accompanying image, suggests a mild 'Outdoor & Adventure' element. The natural environment contributes to a serene exercise experience, warranting a score of 0.5, though it is less pronounced than the main flow element."
