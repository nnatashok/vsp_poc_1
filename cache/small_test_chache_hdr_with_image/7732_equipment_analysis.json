  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title \u001cBack Bends Align\u001d and the category \u001cOn The Mat\u001d suggest a focus on exercises performed on the floor, typically requiring a mat. The description mentions \"warming up\" and practicing backbends, which are commonly associated with yoga or stretching exercises that necessitate a comfortable surface. Thus, the equipment file indicates a mat with a high confidence score (0.9) due to its explicit mention and the context of the workout type."
