  "vibesExplanation": "The workout features pause drills focused on reinforcing technique, which aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe as it involves repetition and concentration. The use of the word 'technique' in the description suggests a 'Masterclass Workout' vibe, as it emphasizes skill-building and focus. The calm setting along the Connecticut River and the cool-down category, along with the country and global hits music choices, add a relaxing element, giving a moderate match to the 'Reboot Workout' vibe. With low maximum rhythm and a cool-down format, more intense vibes were excluded. Scores reflect the evidence strength and alignment with calm, repetitive motion and technique focus."
