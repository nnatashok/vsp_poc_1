  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Whole Body Stretch\" is predominantly characterized by the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit due to its focus on stretching and relaxation, as indicated by the description mentioning the stretching of 'hips, hamstrings, back, and glutes'. The outdoor setting in the scenic environment of Norway further supports the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit, aligning with the image showing natural surroundings, which complements the relaxation elements and invites exploration and connection with nature. The presence of upbeat music like Kygo's remixes gives a slight energetic undertone but does not overshadow the primary restorative and soothing goal. Therefore, 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are the most fitting categories, with scores of 0.9 and 0.8 respectively. The choice of location and activity description strengthens these classifications."
