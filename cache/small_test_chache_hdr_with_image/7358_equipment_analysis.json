  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Consistent Effort Row\" and categorized under \"row,\" indicating that rowing is the primary activity. The description mentions maintaining effort while shifting rhythms, which aligns with rowing exercises. The image confirms this, showing a person on a water rowing setup, likely used to demonstrate form.\n\nThe metadata does not suggest using indoor gym equipment like a rowing machine, which would be common for indoor rowing exercises. Therefore, this analysis assumes the context of an outdoor rowing setting or a less common indoor rowing apparatus not specified in the usual equipment list, such as specific competitive rowing equipment.\n\nThe confidence score is high (0.8) due to clear indications in the title and category that rowing-specific equipment is central to this workout."
