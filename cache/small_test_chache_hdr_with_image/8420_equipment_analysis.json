  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title \"Time Under Tension Row\" and the category \"row\" directly indicate that rowing is a central element of the workout. The description mentions building cardio and endurance along the Charles River, suggesting a rowing-based workout. Given the imagery of rowing on water, this likely translates to using a rowing machine for an indoor setup, as it allows for similar cardio and endurance training in a studio or home environment. The confidence score is very high as rowing machines are typically necessary for this type of workout."
