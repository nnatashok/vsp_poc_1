  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description explicitly states 'Steadily row with Nick and Dani', which strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the category includes 'row', further supporting this requirement. The rowing component appears to be central to the workout, thus a confidence score of 0.8 is assigned."
