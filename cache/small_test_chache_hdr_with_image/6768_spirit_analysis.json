  "spiritsExplanation": "The spirit 'Soothing & Restorative' was selected due to the focus on stretching and muscle relaxation mentioned in the title and description, as well as the use of a foam roller, which is often associated with recovery and stress reduction. The peaceful outdoor setting in Miami and the option for all fitness levels suggest a calming experience, supporting this classification with a strong score of 0.8.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant given the use of music genres like Dance and Global Hits that are often associated with smooth, rhythmic movements. Even though the primary focus is stretching, the presence of music-driven components adds a rhythmic dimension, justifying a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the gentle nature of the activity and lack of any performance or athletic components."
