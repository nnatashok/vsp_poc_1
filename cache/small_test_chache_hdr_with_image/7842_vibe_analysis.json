  "vibesExplanation": "The workout primarily focuses on strength with exercises like core movements, squats, and lunges, emphasizing consistent, fluid movement typical of 'The Groove Session.' The quick pace and inclusion of dance and global hits music further support this vibe with an expressive, rhythm-driven experience. The setting in Norway adds an immersive element, enhancing the fluid groove experience. 'The Meditative Grind' is also relevant due to the repetitive nature of strength exercises on the mat, promoting a zoned-in focus as participants work through the movements. The 20-minute duration contributes to a moderate intensity that suits both vibes. However, the absence of explosive or competitive elements rules out higher-intensity vibes, while the dance music playlist distinctly distinguishes it from purely meditative or foundational workouts."
