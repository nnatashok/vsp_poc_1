  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is named \"Endurance Intervals Row\" and the metadata categorizes it as a rowing workout (\"Category: Sweat,standard,row\"). The format is strictly interval-driven with a focus on climbing intervals at a high rhythm pace. These details strongly imply that a rowing machine is essential for performing the workout effectively. The image attached also features a person on a rowing machine, which reinforces the requirement. Therefore, the confidence level for needing a rowing machine is very high at 1.0. Other equipment is not mentioned or suggested, making rowing machine the sole requirement."
