  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Climbing Intervals Row' suggests a rhythmic approach due to the focus on interval climbing from 22 to 26 strokes per minute, aligning with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The choice of music genres such as Soul/Funk/Disco/Motown further supports this classification by emphasizing musical flow, hence a score of 0.75 for 'Flow & Rhythm.'\n\nThe description highlights fundamentals and a moderate intensity (1 out of 3 with 'breathe' as a workout type), which supports a 'Soothing & Restorative' classification, earning it a score of 0.65. This spirit is indicated by the intention to remind and relax while training.\n\nThe structured intervals ('3', 2', and 1') suggest a 'Structured & Disciplined' approach, fitting a more methodical training style for beginners, hence a score of 0.6. The interval format demonstrates discipline and progression.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' was excluded due to the lower intensity level, and 'Outdoor & Adventure' was not applicable despite the rowing setting, as the focus is on a structured indoor workout rather than exploration."
