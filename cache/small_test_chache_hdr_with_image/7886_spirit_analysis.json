  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Rage Row' is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to its high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format and the description of '60-second intervals.' The music playlist, featuring energetic tracks like 'Low' by Flo Rida and 'Get It Poppin'' by Nelly, further supports this intense classification with a score of 0.9. The workout's maximum rhythm of 32+ strokes per minute and intensity level 3 of 3 reinforce this spirit. \n\nA secondary classification of 'Flow & Rhythm' is proposed with a score of 0.6. The use of music genres like Hip Hop/R&B Mid and Global Hits suggests a strong rhythmic component, encouraging a continuous and engaging workout pace.\n\n'Sport & Agility' is considered with a score of 0.5. The advanced fitness level requirement and the competitive edge of rowing integrate elements of sports performance and technique. \n\nOther spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were not chosen due to the focus on intensity and the indoor rowing format."
