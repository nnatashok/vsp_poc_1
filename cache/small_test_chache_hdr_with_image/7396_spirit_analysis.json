  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Beginner Whole Body Strength' has been primarily classified as 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.7 due to the focus on 'whole body strength' and 'approachable' terms in the description, which indicate a methodical and systematic approach suitable for beginners. Additionally, the categorization as a 'standard' and 'on-the-mat' workout supports this structured focus. \n\nThe setting of the workout, described as 'Join Peter in Siena,' alongside the outdoor image, aligns with 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.6. The scenic environment provides an adventurous element though it's conducted on a mat, which slightly limits the adventurous nature.\n\nLastly, a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is noted with a score of 0.55. The 'approachable' nature and shorter duration (15 minutes) suggest a potentially relaxing and accessible session, reinforced by the 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits' music stations that imply a calming atmosphere."
