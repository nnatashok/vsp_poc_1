  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is infused with an all-80s playlist, featuring upbeat and iconic tracks like '9 to 5' and 'Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,' which strongly aligns with 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe due to its energetic and fun nature, comparable to a lively party or dance setting. This matches the vibe of an engaging, music-driven experience, hence the high score of 0.75. \n\nThe interval format and rowing focus suggest a consistent, repetitive activity typical of 'The Meditative Grind.' The moderately high rhythm (30) and the workout's classification as a 'sweat' workout further support this vibe for its endurance-oriented aspect. Therefore, it received a score of 0.65.\n\nLastly, the 'Endorphin Wave' is relevant given the steady energy and feel-good nature brought by the upbeat music and standard rowing, which progressively builds energy throughout the session. The exercise's duration and intermediate fitness level enhance this classification, earning a score of 0.6.\n\n'Warrior' or 'Firestarter' vibes are less applicable due to the moderate intensity (level 2 out of 3) noted in the metadata, indicating a less aggressive or explosive workout."
