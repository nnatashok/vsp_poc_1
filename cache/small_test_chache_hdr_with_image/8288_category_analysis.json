  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'HIIT' and 'Indoor rowing' based on explicit details in the metadata. The description mentions 'high-intensity intervals' and 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3', clearly indicating a HIIT format with intense effort, earning a high score of 0.9. While the image shows outdoor rowing, the structure and context suggest the workout's intensity mirrors an indoor rowing format, matching the 'row' category tag and gaining a score of 0.8 for 'Indoor rowing'. The music playlist and description align with a motivating, upbeat HIIT session. Other potential categories were excluded as they don't fit the high-intensity, interval-based rowing focus."
