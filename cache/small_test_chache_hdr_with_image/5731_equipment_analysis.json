  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Core Flow' which emphasizes yoga, suggesting the need for a mat to provide comfort and stability during poses. The category 'On The Mat' explicitly indicates the use of a mat, and the image confirms the presence of a mat since the instructor is seen standing on one. Thus, there is very high confidence that a mat is required for this workout."
