  "categoriesExplanation": "The main category chosen is 'Indoor rowing' with a high score of 0.9. The workout's name 'Steady Fundamentals Row' and description mentioning 'steadily row at a rhythm' strongly highlights rowing as the central activity, matching well to the 'Indoor rowing' category. The image suggests rowing activity is outdoor, but the nature of the exercise involves rowing technique applicable to both indoor and outdoor settings.\n\nThe category 'Breathing exercises' is also considered, with a moderate score of 0.6, due to the description stating 'Workout Type: breathe' and 'Workout intensity level: 1 out of 3' indicating a focus on controlled breathing and low intensity.\n\nOther categories like 'Mat', 'Stretching', or 'Meditation' were excluded due to lack of relevant indicators in the metadata, while the music and playlist information doesn't explicitly relate to the workout type."
