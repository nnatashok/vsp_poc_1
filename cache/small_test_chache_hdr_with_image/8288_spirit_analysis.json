  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Rock HIIT Row' is characterized by its high-intensity intervals and a soundtrack of energetic rock music, clearly aligning it with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The title and description include phrases like 'high-intensity', 'push', and 'intensity level: 3 out of 3', indicating a demanding and vigorous session. The inclusion of rock music such as 'Zombie' by The Cranberries and 'Centuries' by Fall Out Boy further emphasizes this energetic intensity, allowing a score of 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also partially applicable, as the workout involves rhythmical rowing with music that aids in the pacing and coordination. While the session is more focused on intensity, the music-driven aspect provides a moderate level of synchronization and connection with the beat, resulting in a score of 0.5 for 'Flow & Rhythm'. The image suggesting outdoor rowing does not significantly contribute to other spirits, as this detail is not prominent in the metadata description."
