  "categoriesConfidence": 0.85,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category is 'Indoor rowing' with high confidence (0.9) due to the title 'Cardio Cruise Row,' which strongly indicates rowing, supported by the use of rowing terms like 'interval' and 'max rhythm: 26.' Additionally, the photo confirms the rowing activity.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Breathing exercises,' scored at 0.7. The workout description emphasizes low intensity and breathing ('Workout Type: breathe' and 'Category: Breathe'), aligning with breathing exercises focusing on mindful breathing and relaxation.\n\nWhile 'Breathe' and 'standard' are noted, 'Breathing exercises' is appropriate due to the focus on intention and breathing rather than just conventional cardio or rowing.\n\nOther categories are excluded due to lack of specific evidence in the metadata indicating other fitness disciplines."
