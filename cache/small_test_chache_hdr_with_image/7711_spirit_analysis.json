  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'To the Max Row' strongly indicates a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, with a focus on 'maximum effort' and 45-second high-intensity intervals. The intensity is also validated by the description of the workout type as 'drive' and intensity level '3 out of 3'. The playlist features energetic and motivational songs like 'Eye of the Tiger', enhancing the intense spirit. A score of 0.9 reflects the strong alignment with a high-energy profile.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also prominent due to the reference to 'rhythm' in the description and the continuous intervals that suggest a focus on coordinated movement. The music genre and pop hits further support a rhythmic element. A score of 0.7 is given for the noticeable, but secondary, presence of flowing rhythm within the workout.\n\nWhile the workout includes outdoor rowing (as shown in the image), the primary focus appears to be the high-energy, rhythmic format, ruling out other spirits."
