  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is strongly aligned with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to the description highlighting an increase in volume and intensity, emphasized by short intervals. The use of the word 'sweat' and intensity level of 2 out of 3 further indicate a focus on high-energy exercise. The presence of upbeat 80s hits like 'I'm So Excited' and 'Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go' suggests an energetic atmosphere. This results in a strong match score of 0.75.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is represented by the emphasis on music-driven pacing with an all-80s playlist, creating a rhythmic workout environment. The max rhythm of 30 and the playlist featuring popular, rhythmic songs from the 80s contribute to a flow-focused session, achieving a strong match score of 0.65.\n\nSport-specific elements are less prominent, given the focus on intensity and flow, hence 'Sport & Agility' was not selected. 'Structured & Disciplined' was also not applicable as the workout lacks rigid progressive elements."
