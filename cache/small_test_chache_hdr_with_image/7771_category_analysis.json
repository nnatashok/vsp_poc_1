  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is predominantly classified as 'Indoor rowing' due to the repeated mention of rowing elements in the metadata, supported by visual cues indicating water-based rowing. The title \"Steady Adventure Row\" and focus on maintaining a consistent split reinforce this classification, leading to a high confidence score of 0.9.\n\n'Breathing exercises' is also applicable, as indicated by the 'Workout Type: breathe' and the emphasis on maintaining rhythm and control, suggesting a strong breathing component. The score of 0.7 reflects the focus but is secondary to the primary rowing aspect.\n\nThough the video seems to be on water, the structured intervals and pacing suggest it aligns with rowing workout formats. Other categories like 'Meditation' or 'Yoga' are less relevant due to the emphasized physicality and pacing of the session."
