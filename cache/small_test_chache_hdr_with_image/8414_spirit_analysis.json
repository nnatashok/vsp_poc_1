  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Learn and Burn Row' has a notable 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to its environment, described as rowing past Aialik Glacier and learning about marine wildlife like humpback whales and orcas. These elements suggest a strong connection to nature and exploration (score: 0.75). The music selection, including songs like 'Sunflower' and inclusion of indie/global hits, adds a 'Flow & Rhythm'' dimension, indicating smooth, music-driven pacing and a lighter vibe (score: 0.6). The HIIT format and 'sweat' category lend a level of intensity and structure similar to 'Structured & Disciplined', though to a lesser degree than other spirits (score: 0.4). The combination of instruction about wildlife and rowing suggests some level of education and methodical movement. The intermediate fitness level requirement and HIIT format reinforce this structured yet adventurous scope."
