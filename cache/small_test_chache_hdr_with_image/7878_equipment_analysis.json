  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is clearly titled 'Joyful Intention Row', which strongly indicates the central use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the category mentions 'row', reinforcing that this is a rowing workout. The description of 'climb up and down the pyramid at a jog pace' suggests a rowing exercise rather than an alternative type of training. The image provided also depicts a person rowing, which visually confirms the need for row-specific equipment. Thus, the confidence level for needing a rowing machine is very high at 1.0."
