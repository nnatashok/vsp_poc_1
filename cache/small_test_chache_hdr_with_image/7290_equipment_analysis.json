  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Newport Beach HIIT Row', and the description mentions 'high intensity intervals'. The category includes 'row', indicating that rowing is the central activity of the workout. High confidence is assigned to the rowing machine since rowing is explicitly mentioned multiple times, suggesting the use of an indoor rowing machine.
