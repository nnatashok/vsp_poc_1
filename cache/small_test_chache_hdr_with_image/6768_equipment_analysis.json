  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The \"Essential Stretches for Your Back\" workout specifically mentions the use of a foam roller in its description: \"Use your foam roller to stretch major muscles in your back.\" This explicitly indicates the foam roller is central to the workout, leading to a very high confidence score of 1.0 for its necessity. Additionally, the category \"On The Mat\" and the image showing two people utilizing mats strongly suggest that a mat is a required part of the setup, justifying a high confidence score of 0.8."
