  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly labeled as a 'Whole Body Stretch' in both the title and description, with specific mention of stretching target areas like hips, hamstrings, back, and glutes. The setting on the mat is indicated in the category tags and visually confirmed through the image, justifying the inclusion of 'Mat' as a secondary category. The music and playlist are secondary to the workout's core nature, which focuses on stretching. Thus, 'Stretching' is assigned a score of 1.0 for being the central defining characteristic, and 'Mat' is given a score of 0.6 due to the workout's performance on mats."
