  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Steady State Row' and includes terms like 'row at rhythms' and 'build your cardio base', which strongly indicate the use of a rowing machine. The category and type of workout are both labeled as 'row', reinforcing that rowing is the primary activity. The presence of an outdoor rowing image suggests similar training, but for indoor workouts, an indoor rowing machine is typically necessary. Therefore, the confidence in requiring a rowing machine is very high at 1.0."
