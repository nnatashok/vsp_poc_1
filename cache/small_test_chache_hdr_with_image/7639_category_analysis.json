  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is clearly identified as a 'Beginner Yoga Flow,' explicitly signaling the main category as Yoga with a high confidence score of 1. The mention of 'flow' in the title and description supports this classification, indicating a series of yoga postures. The use of yoga blocks as optional equipment further reinforces the Yoga classification. The scenic outdoor setting does not contradict this classification and aligns well with a Yoga practice that can be performed outdoors.\n\nThe secondary category of Stretching is suggested with a score of 0.5 due to Yoga\u2019s inherent emphasis on flexibility and range of motion improvement as supported by the Yoga flow nature. Overall confidence is high at 0.95, given the direct evidence in the title, description, and the visual imagery of a yoga mat and blocks, consistent with Yoga practices."
