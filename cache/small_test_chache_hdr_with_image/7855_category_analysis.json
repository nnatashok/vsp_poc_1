  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'HIIT' given the description of 50-second intervals and a high-intensity rhythm stated as 32, which aligns with typical High-Intensity Interval Training characteristics. The title, 'Express Bootcamp HIIT Row,' also explicitly mentions HIIT. The score for HIIT is set at 0.9 due to these strong indicators.\n\nDespite the image showing outdoor rowing, the rowing component mentioned in the title and categorization as 'row' in metadata suggest an indoor rowing connection, but considering the imagery, this is marginally less certain. Thus, it achieves a score of 0.7, suitable for 'Indoor rowing,' assuming a possible cross-relevant context but mindful of the outdoor aspect shown.\n\nOther categories like 'Mat,' 'Running,' or 'Treadmill' were excluded due to lack of relevant indicators in the metadata or visuals."
