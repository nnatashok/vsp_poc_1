  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.9 due to its high intensity level (3 out of 3) and the focus on 'climbing intervals' and 'personal best,' which imply maximum effort and cardiovascular challenge. The use of high-energy pop music supports this spirit, as does the term 'power' in the format, suggesting a focus on strength and endurance.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' receives a score of 0.7. The maximum rhythm above 30, alongside music genres like Pop and Global Hits, suggests a pace-driven approach, fostering a rhythmic and coordinated workout experience.\n\n'Sport & Agility' scores 0.6, given the rowing nature of the session and the visual of rowing in an outdoor setting, implying a performance-based aspect requiring coordination and skill.\n\nOther spirits had low relevance due to the lack of relaxation, structured training protocols, or emphasis on outdoor exploration in the metadata provided."
