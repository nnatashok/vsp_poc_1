  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 20 minutes and inclusion of squats and lunges at a quick pace indicates a moderate level of effort, suitable for less fit users. The uptempo music playlist suggests sustained movement, increasing the workout's demand. However, the quick pace and variety of core exercises suggest that those with lower fitness levels could find it more challenging.",
