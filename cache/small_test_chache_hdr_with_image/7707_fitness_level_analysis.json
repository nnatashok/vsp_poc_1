  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves rowing at a steady rhythm of 18, which is considered an accessible row format and labeled as 'breathe', indicating a focus on maintaining a calm, steady pace. These elements, combined with being described as a 'jogging pace', suggest relatively simple techniques typically suitable for beginners. However, some slight technique management is necessary to maintain proper form, giving a minor potential for an intermediate classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout intensity is rated as 1 out of 3, indicating a low physical demand. The duration is relatively short at 16 minutes, further supporting a classification of 'Light' effort. The description as a steady-paced, rhythmic row also complements this assessment, though there might be slightly more effort required at the upper range of 'Light', pushing into a 'Moderate' score due to maintaining a continual rowing motion.",
