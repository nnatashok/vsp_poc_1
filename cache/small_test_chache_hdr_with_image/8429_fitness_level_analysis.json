  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'drive,' which frequently demands advanced skills to execute proper rowing technique efficiently. The 'HIIT' format adds to the complexity, as participants must manage high-intensity rhythms and transitions between intervals. A max rhythm of 32 also indicates advanced coordination and stability requirements, supporting a strong alignment with Advanced and Expert levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 21 minutes coupled with a highest intensity level of 3/3 suggests a vigorous effort. The 'HIIT' format further indicates high physical demand, intensifying with a fast-paced rhythm and minimal rest, implying significant effort. Thus, the effort is mainly Challenging, edging towards Extreme due to the intensive interval training.",
