  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"Yoga\" with a score of 0.9. This is due to the explicit mention of 'Restorative Yoga' in the title, which strongly suggests a yoga practice. The description supports this by highlighting gentle movements and spending time in each pose, typical of restorative yoga practices.\n\n\"Mat\" is a secondary category with a score of 0.6, as the workout involves floor exercises on a mat. The presence of the phrase 'on the mat' in the tags and the visual confirmation of a yoga mat in the image further supports this.\n\nThe use of chill and downtempo music also aligns with a relaxing and restorative yoga session. \"Yoga\" was chosen over \"Stretching\" or \"Meditation\" due to the specific mention of restorative yoga, rather than emphasizing flexibility or mindfulness exercises alone. The classification confidence is high due to the clear indicators in the metadata."
