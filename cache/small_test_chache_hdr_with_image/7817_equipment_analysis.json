  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's title, '80's Fun Summer Row,' along with the category 'row,' explicitly indicates that a rowing machine is central to this workout. Additionally, the description references intervals which are common in rowing workouts. The image attached to the metadata also shows a person engaged in rowing on water, reinforcing the use of a rowing machine for the workout simulation. Therefore, the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high, at 0.9."
