  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is row-based with a 'pyramid' format, suggesting some rhythmic variation but no inherently complex movements beyond standard rowing technique. Given the \"breathe\" classification and beginner requirement, movements are likely straightforward, with synchronized rhythm being the primary challenge, which slightly leans into Intermediate.",
