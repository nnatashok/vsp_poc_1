  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, 'Granite State Challenge', includes terms like 'drive', 'standard', and 'row' in the metadata, indicating it's focused on rowing. The mention of 'maximum meters' further suggests a rowing activity. While the image shows an outdoor rowing situation, the metadata is for an indoor workout setup, implying the use of a rowing machine with high confidence (0.9). The indoor setting and competitive aspect support the requirement for a rowing machine for effective participation in this challenge."
