  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is named 'Pure Energy Row,' and it includes high-intensity intervals, which typically involve rowing exercises. The description mentions rowing along the Charles River, implying a focus on rowing movements. While the image shows people rowing on water, this workout is most likely translated into a land-based context using an indoor rowing machine for practical reasons. The 'drive' and 'row' categories further support the emphasis on rowing as the primary activity, leading to a very high confidence score for requiring a rowing machine."
