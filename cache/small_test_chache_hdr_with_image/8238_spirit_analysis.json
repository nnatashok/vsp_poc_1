  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Technique Cool-Down' and described as a cool down, clearly emphasizes relaxation and recovery, aligning it primarily with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The mention of focusing on technique with a steady format and a max rhythm of 22 further implies a gentle pace that prioritizes form over intensity. This justifies a strong score of 0.8 for the 'Soothing & Restorative' category. \n\nSecondly, the use of the word 'technique' combined with a focus on rhythm (max rhythm: 22) suggests an element of 'Flow & Rhythm,' earning it a moderate score of 0.6. The songs played by Bruce Springsteen can contribute to maintaining a sense of continuity and fluidity in the workout. \n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Structured & Disciplined,' 'Sport & Agility,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the absence of high intensity, detailed protocols, sports-specific drills, or outdoor elements in the metadata provided."
