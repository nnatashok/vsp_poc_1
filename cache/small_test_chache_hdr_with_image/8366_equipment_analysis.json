  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category with the workout type being 'drive', both strongly suggesting the use of a rowing machine. The description mentions racing off at 'high rhythms to accumulate maximum meters' which aligns with the typical use of a rowing machine, where intensity and distance are key objectives. The image also shows a person using a rowing setup, reinforcing the connection to rowing equipment. Thus, the confidence in requiring a rowing machine is very high at 0.9."
