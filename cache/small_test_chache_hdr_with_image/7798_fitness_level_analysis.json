  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'Drive' is noted, aligning with Hydrow's category for advanced technique. The use of HIIT intervals implies a need for precise form under fatigue and coordination, elevating this to Advanced. Given the structured phases, there's also an argument for Expert due to the necessity of managing form through changes.",
