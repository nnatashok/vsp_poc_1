  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under \"Indoor rowing\" with a high score of 0.8. This is based on the workout name \"Step by Step Row\" and the description that mentions rowing on Lake Tahoe. Even though the image shows outdoor rowing, the context fits indoor rowing sessions similar to structured rowing workouts. Additionally, the workout type named \"breathe\" and the low intensity level suggest a focus on \"Breathing exercises,\" earning a score of 0.6. This matches the calming, rhythmic nature suitable for breathing work. The term \"breathe\" and the low-intensity level demonstrate its significance in the workout. Categories like \"Yoga\" or \"Meditation\" were considered but excluded due to the explicit focus on rowing, making \"Indoor rowing\" and \"Breathing exercises\" most fitting."
