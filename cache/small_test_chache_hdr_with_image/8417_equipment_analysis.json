  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Upper Body Strength with Bands' and the description explicitly mention the use of resistance bands, affirming their necessity for the workout with a very high confidence score of 1.0. The category includes 'On The Mat,' suggesting a mat is used for the exercises, giving it a high confidence score of 0.8, as mats are commonly needed for exercises done while standing or lying on the floor to provide cushioning and grip. The image further supports this as it shows a person standing on a mat while using resistance bands."
