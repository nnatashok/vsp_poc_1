  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves rowing with intervals, which suggests a need for some coordination beyond basic rowing. The technique required for rowing intervals can be moderately complex, as maintaining proper form is necessary for effectiveness and injury prevention. This aligns with an intermediate fitness level demand, supported by the interval structure and max rhythm of 28, indicating slightly more complex movements than purely beginner routines.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is of moderate duration (16 minutes) with a sweat category and uses rock and metal music, adding an energetic pace. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicates a challenging workout, but the total duration keeps it within the moderate effort difficulty realm for those less fit. Therefore, both moderate and challenging levels apply due to the interval format increasing the overall demand slightly.",
