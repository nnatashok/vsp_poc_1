  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of this workout is 'The Firestarter.' This is supported by the 10 sets of 1-minute high-intensity intervals mentioned in the description, which align perfectly with the fast and explosive nature typical of this vibe. The music genre includes rock mid-intensity tracks, which would support the electrifying feel. The confidence is very high at 0.8 due to the explicit mention of HIIT and the advanced fitness level requirement.\n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Warrior Workout,' with a score of 0.7, given the high-intensity intervals and maximum intensity level of 3 out of 3, which suggests a sweat-dripping, beast-mode type of workout. The duration of over 20 minutes with consistent drive infers the intensity and endurance required, supporting this vibe.\n\nFinally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is considered with a moderate score of 0.5 due to the overall duration and rhythm of the workout, providing an elevated energy vibe. However, the short intensity bursts primarily suggest the former vibes."
