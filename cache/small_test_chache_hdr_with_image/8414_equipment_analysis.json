  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Learn and Burn Row' and the category metadata which includes 'row' strongly indicate that a rowing machine is required.

This, alongside the fact that it's listed as a HIIT workout, suggests that the rowing machine is central to the exercise, leading to a high confidence score of 0.9."
