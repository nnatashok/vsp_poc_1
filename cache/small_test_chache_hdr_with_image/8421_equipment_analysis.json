  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'On The Mat' and 'flow,' which strongly indicates the use of a **Mat** (1.0 confidence) for comfort and support during floor exercises. The description also explicitly mentions that a **yoga block** is recommended, aligning with the title 'Core Flow' and the nature of the workout, scoring it a 0.9 confidence. The image provides additional evidence showing both a mat and a block being used in an outdoor setting, further supporting their necessity for this workout."
