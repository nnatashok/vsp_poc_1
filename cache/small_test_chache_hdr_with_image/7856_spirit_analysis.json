  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Comeback Row\" emphasizes building rhythm with the phrase \"Gradually build in rhythm,\" suggesting a smooth and music-driven experience, aligning it with the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit. The presence of indie and global music further supports this, contributing to a moderate score of 0.75. The low intensity level (1 out of 3) and focus on building fitness and making a comeback speak to a gentle approach, justifying the selection of \"Soothing & Restorative\" with a score of 0.6. Additionally, the outdoor rowing imagery in the video and the mention of a climb format suggest an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" element, with environmental engagement and exploration, warranting a score of 0.5. The low intensity and focus on rhythm exclude more intense spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Sport & Agility.\""
