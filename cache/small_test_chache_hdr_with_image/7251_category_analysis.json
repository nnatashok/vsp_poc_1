  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified into 'Body weight' with a high score of 0.9 because the description explicitly mentions 'bodyweight exercises.' This indicates a strong focus on using the body's own weight for strength training, aligning perfectly with the category definition. 'Mat' is also selected with a score of 0.8. The mention of 'On The Mat' in the category section and the visual of participants seated on mats suggests that the exercises are conducted on a mat, justified by the recurring 'on-the-mat' reference. Other categories such as 'Calisthenics' were considered but not chosen as no specific evidence of gymnastic movements is provided. The overall confidence is high due to clear indicators in the metadata and the accompanying image."
