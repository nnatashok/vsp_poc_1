  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'To the Max Row' involves high-intensity interval training with a focus on \"maximum effort,\" as indicated in the description. The use of 45-second intervals and a max rhythm of 34 adds to the structured but intense nature of the workout, aligning closely with 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe (score: 0.8), characterized by heart-racing intensity and unpredictable challenges due to interval timing. \n\nThe playlist includes energetic hits like 'Eye of the Tiger' and 'Don't Stop Movin',' contributing to a feel-good, energetic experience that typifies 'The Endorphin Wave' (score: 0.75), as the energetic pop and global hits fuel an elevated energy throughout the session.\n\nLastly, the workout's focus on rhythm, repetition, and the advanced intensity level fits with 'The Meditative Grind' (score: 0.7), where the consistent drive and focus on rowing allow for endurance and mental zoning in. The combination of these vibes covers the structured, intense yet rhythmically backed experience of the session."
