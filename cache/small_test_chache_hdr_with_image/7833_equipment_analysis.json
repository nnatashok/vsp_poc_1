  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Advanced HIIT Row' explicitly indicates that rowing is the central activity. The description mentions 'reach high rhythms at maximum effort,' which suggests a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout focusing on rowing. The category 'Drive,standard,row' further supports this classification. The image features individuals in a rowing setup, reinforcing the need for a rowing machine. Thus, the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high at 0.9."
