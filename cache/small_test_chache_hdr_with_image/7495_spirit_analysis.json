  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout is classified primarily under 'Structured & Disciplined' because it includes 'mobility', 'functional movement', and 'strength building exercises', which suggest a methodical and precise approach to training aimed at runners. The playlist of remixed dance and global hits suggests a rhythmic element, supporting a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit as key to maintaining coordination and continuity in movement. The music choice of remixes likely encourages tempo and pacing, enhancing the flow aspect. The outdoor setting, although visually present, doesn't heavily influence the workout's nature, which is mainly focused on structured training rather than nature-based exploration. The music and workout categories both support a combined focus on rhythm and structure, thus earning a significant score for both 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Flow & Rhythm.'"
