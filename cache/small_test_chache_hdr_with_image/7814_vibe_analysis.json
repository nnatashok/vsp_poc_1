  "vibesExplanation": "The workout name 'Gradual Warm-Up' and description indicating a 'gradual climb in rhythm' align well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The focus on correct form and the rhythmic nature are typical of endurance or meditative workouts, meriting a high score of 0.7. The music selection, featuring dance and global hits, along with songs like 'Body Groove' and 'Get Out My Head', suggests a fun and engaging atmosphere, fitting 'The Groove Session' vibe. However, the primary function as a warm-up caps the intensity; thus, the groove vibe is secondary with a score of 0.6. The confidence level is fairly high at 0.75, given the clear cues provided by the metadata, although the absence of an instructor and unspecified music genre add slight ambiguity."
