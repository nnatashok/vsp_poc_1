  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Steady Fundamentals Row' emphasizes a rhythmic pace, suggested by the steady rowing at a rhythm of 22, and the segmented focus on different muscle groups. This aligns well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, as it involves continuous, smooth movements, likely guided by the pacing of the music. The score is high at 0.8 due to the direct mention of maintaining a rhythm.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also applicable, with a score of 0.6. The workout's steady format, 5-minute segments for arms, core, and legs, and the consistent rhythm imply a methodical approach and disciplined execution.\n\nThere is some alignment with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, given the low-intensity level, breathing focus, and calming music choice. These elements support a restorative experience, warranting a score of 0.5.\n\nThe imagery of rowing outdoors near water might suggest 'Outdoor & Adventure,' but the primary environment is not emphasized in the metadata. Overall, the clear rhythm and structure take precedence in defining the workout's spirit."
