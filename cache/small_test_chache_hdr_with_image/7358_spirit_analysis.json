  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Consistent Effort Row' emphasizes maintaining a consistent effort while shifting rhythms, indicating a structured approach. The use of specific rhythm numbers (20 to 24) and the interval format suggest a methodical, disciplined training session, hence the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.7.\n\nThe workout's inclusion in the 'Breathe' category and emphasis on consistent effort with a moderate rhythm range, paired with rock and global hits music, indicates elements of fluid motion and coordination, aligning it with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, receiving a score of 0.6.\n\nGiven the visual context of rowing outdoors, there is a mild presence of the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. However, it scores lower at 0.4, as the workout does not emphasize environmental exploration or challenges.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to low intensity and focus on consistent pacing."
