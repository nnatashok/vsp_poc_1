  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Learn and Burn Row' primarily embodies 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its rowing format and intermediate intensity level, typical of endurance-focused and repetitive movements. The long rowing session aligns well with a meditative state, scoring a 0.7 for this match. Additionally, the scenic mention of 'cruising past Aialik Glacier' suggests an experiential and exploratory component, linking it to 'The Explorer's Workout' vibe with a score of 0.6. The music playlist featuring indie and global hits like 'Sunflower' by Post Malone and 'Dreams' by The Cranberries adds a rhythmic and expressive element, contributing to 'The Groove Session' vibe with a 0.5. Overall, the focus on scenery, aquatic animals, and a relaxed music choice support these vibes, though there is some ambiguity due to the HIIT format which suggests some intensity."
