  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Running Up the Hill Row\" and described as a 'row inspired' workout, which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the category and description specify 'row,' confirming that the activity focuses on rowing. The HIIT format and reference to rowing reinforce the requirement of a rowing machine for this workout. The confidence level is very high (1.0) as the equipment is central and explicitly mentioned."
