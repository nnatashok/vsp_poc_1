  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily focused on stretching, specifically targeting the hip flexors and adductors, which aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe as it involves deep stretching and a total-body refresh. The music played, like 'Fragile' by Kygo and 'Melt (Remastered)' by Leftfield, suggests a calming and mellow atmosphere that supports relaxation, further reinforcing this vibe. The short duration of 5 minutes and 45 seconds aligns with the purpose of a quick, refreshing session post-rowing. \n\n'Zen Flow' is also a relevant vibe due to the intentional and breath-centered nature of the stretching routine. The lack of a specified music genre or intensity suggests an unhurried and grounding session. The confidence level is high because the description and context offer strong indicators for these vibes, helped by music choices categorized as 'Dance mid, Global Hits' which add a rhythmic yet relaxing quality to the experience."
