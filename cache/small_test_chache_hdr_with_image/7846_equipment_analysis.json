  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Effort Focused Row,' strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine. The description mentions maintaining a 'split rowing at a rhythm' during intervals and features instructors teaching how to control your effort while rowing. These are clear indicators of a rowing workout. Additionally, the image shows an outdoor rowing scene, which supports the need for a rowing machine for an indoor equivalent. Given the emphasis on rowing intervals and rhythms, the confidence level is very high (0.9)."
