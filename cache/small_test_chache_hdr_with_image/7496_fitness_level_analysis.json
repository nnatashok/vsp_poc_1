  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves high-intensity interval training (HIIT) which typically requires good coordination and body awareness, aligning with intermediate and advanced levels. The use of rowing technique under 'Drive' category, further suggests a moderately complex movement pattern. The mention of high-intensity intervals indicates a need for precision and skill, warranting a classification bordering between Intermediate and Advanced.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a high-intensity interval session with an intensity level of 3 out of 3. This suggests significant energy expenditure. The duration of 21 minutes with a format similar to a sprint track workout implies a challenging to extreme level of effort. Max rhythm of 28 indicates fast-paced rowing, adding to the physical demand.",
