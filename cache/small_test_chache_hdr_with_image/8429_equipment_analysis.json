  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout 'Racing Mindset Row' describes a rowing exercise as indicated by the use of terms like 'row', 'drive', and reference to the Charles River, implying the activity is rowing-focused. The format is 'HIIT', which aligns with the high-intensity nature of rowing workouts. Although the image shows outdoor rowing, it's likely designed to be performed on an indoor rowing machine given the context of at-home workouts. This leads to very high confidence that a rowing machine is needed."
