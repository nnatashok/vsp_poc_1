  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"High-Energy & Intense\" due to the nature of HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training), as explicitly mentioned in the workout name and description. The use of energetic music tracks like \"Titanium\" and \"Runaway (U & I)\", commonly associated with high-intensity workouts, supports this categorization. The score of 0.9 reflects the very high correlation between the workout's HIIT style and this spirit.\n\n\"Sport & Agility\" is also considered with a score of 0.5 due to the HIIT strength elements that enhance athletic performance\u2014improving strength, speed, and agility.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit receives a score of 0.4, as the visual context indicates a natural setting. This adds an adventurous element, though it's not central to the workout's focus. \n\nOther possible spirits such as \"Flow & Rhythm\" and \"Soothing & Restorative\" were excluded due to the lack of indicators in both the workout description and music selection that would suggest a more relaxing or rhythm-based approach."
