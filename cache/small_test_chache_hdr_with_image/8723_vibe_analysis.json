  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Reboot Workout' is assigned due to the clear focus on a cool-down session, intended to lower the heart rate and provide a total-body refresh. The short duration of 5 minutes and 44 seconds, combined with the calm environment along the Charles River, supports this classification. The use of pop and global hits at a lower intensity further suggests a soothing atmosphere, conducive to recovery and relaxation, earning a score of 0.8.\n\nThe 'The Meditative Grind' vibe is also relevant, as the workout takes place in a repetitive rowing format, which aligns with the idea of zoning in and letting the repetition take over. The steady rhythm and cool-down category reinforce a meditative approach, with a slightly lower score of 0.7 due to the presence of pop music, which might make it less typical of deeply meditative sessions. However, the consistent pacing suggests a thoughtful, steady experience."
