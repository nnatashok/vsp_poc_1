  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Step by Step Row,\" and the repeated emphasis on rowing concepts (such as rhythm and climb) strongly suggests that a rowing machine is needed. The category 'row' and the description referring to rowing on water further indicate that the workout simulates rowing, likely indoors, requiring a rowing machine. The image also shows individuals using outdoor rowing, drawing a parallel to indoor rowing techniques. These elements justify a confidence score of 0.9 for the rowing machine."
