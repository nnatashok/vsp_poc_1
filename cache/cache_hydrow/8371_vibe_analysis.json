  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Steady Cool-Down,' which clearly indicates a focus on recovery and gradual heart rate reduction, fitting the description of 'The Reboot Workout' vibe. The metadata describes it as a steady rowing session, reinforcing this choice. The playlist includes 'El Cantante' by Marc Anthony, suggesting a soothing tempo that supports the calming and refreshing nature of the workout. The use of Latin and Global Hits radio stations contributes to a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere, justifying a score of 0.7 for 'The Reboot Workout.'\n\nAdditionally, 'The Zen Flow' vibe is also relevant due to the workout's unhurried and grounding qualities, as implied by the steady rowing format and duration of just over five minutes, resulting in a score of 0.6. There is no instructor, which could encourage a more introspective and self-directed experience, aligning with the 'Zen Flow' characteristics. Other vibes were excluded as the workout lacks intensity or competitive elements."
