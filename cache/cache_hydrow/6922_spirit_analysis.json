  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to its description emphasizing high rhythms and achieving a personal best, coupled with a maximum rhythm of 32+ and the intensity level rated as 3 out of 3. The format being labeled as 'Power' further supports this classification, suggesting a session focused on exertion and vigorous effort. The playlist including high-energy songs like 'Crazy On You' and 'Barracuda' by Heart adds to the intense experience.\n\nAdditionally, the image indicates that the rowing is conducted outdoors, on a body of water beside large ships, providing a clear context for 'Outdoor & Adventure'. This setting leverages nature and environmental exploration as key components of the workout, adding an adventurous element. Thus, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is also significantly embodied in this session."
