  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row,' indicating the primary equipment needed is a rowing machine, with very high confidence. The name 'Climbing Intervals Row' and the description 'Climb up in rhythm with Mike during two 4-minute intervals' strongly imply rowing exercises are central to the session. The presence of water rowing imagery also supports the use of a rowing machine."
