  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Efficiency Row' strongly embodies the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the constant shifts in rhythm every 30 seconds, as well as the alignment with upbeat music like 'Dynamite' and 'Party Rock Anthem.' These elements lead to a score of 0.9, indicating a strong match. Additionally, the image depicts rowing on a river, suggesting an 'Outdoor & Adventure' element with a score of 0.7, as nature-based rowing inherently includes adventure aspects. Lastly, the workout type 'sweat' and the use of high-energy songs imply a 'High-Energy & Intense' component, but the intensity level (2 out of 3) moderates this, resulting in a score of 0.6. The combination of interval format and pop hits further supports the alignment with high energy and rhythmic flow, though the outdoor setting weights slightly more toward adventure."
