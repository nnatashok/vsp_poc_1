  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 20:32, typical for moderate effort levels. Pilates is known for low-to-medium intensity, focusing on controlled movements and core strength. The music choice with upbeat songs suggests a tempo that might increase heart rate without reaching high-intensity levels. Hence, it aligns with a moderate classification, suitable for users needing a bit more challenge than light workouts.",
