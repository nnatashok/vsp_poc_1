  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Sweet Spot Warm-Up' suggests a gentle introduction with a focus on finding a steady rhythm ('sweet spot'), aligning well with 'The Meditative Grind.' This vibe is a moderate match due to the emphasis on repetition and endurance, evident from elements like rowing and the format being a warm-up. The use of rock music from 'KISS' with mid-intensity implies a subtle buildup of energy, hence 'The Endorphin Wave' as a secondary vibe. The moderate duration and heart rate increase support the feeling of an endorphin boost. High-intensity vibes were excluded as the session does not heavily emphasize explosive or high-paced elements."
