  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Yoga Flow\" clearly indicates an emphasis on fluid movement and coordination, typical of the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit. The use of 'flow' in the title, along with the description mentioning \"move through this flow,\" strongly aligns with the characteristics of this spirit. The music selection reinforces this, featuring chill and downtempo tracks, which suggests a smooth and continuous rhythm, further supporting this categorization. A strong score of 0.9 is assigned to \"Flow & Rhythm\" due to these explicit indicators.\n\nAdditionally, the workout takes place in a \"sunny park in Los Angeles,\" which introduces an element of nature and outdoor setting, aligning with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. This spirit is applicable due to the natural environment, even though the workout is on mat and not terrain-explorative. Therefore, a score of 0.7 is given to \"Outdoor & Adventure.\" The visual confirmation of the park setting further reinforces this classification. Thus, both spirits are relevant, but primarily the session embodies a \"Flow & Rhythm\" approach."
