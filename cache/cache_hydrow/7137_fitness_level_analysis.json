  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given the category 'row', the Technique Difficulty aligns with the Beginner or Intermediate level due to rowing being less technically complex compared to other advanced exercises. The workout description emphasizes learning and cruising, indicating a focus on proper basic rowing form provided by the instructor, who brings a fun personality, reducing complexity perception for beginners. Thus, Beginner receives a strong score, but Intermediate is included for alignment with the 'sweat' workout type suggesting more focus on refining technique.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout 'Learn and Burn Row' lasts over 21 minutes with an interval format and an intensity level marked as 2 out of 3. This suggests a moderate effort for users in poor physical shape with some variation in energy expenditure due to intervals. Although not overly demanding, the duration and sustained effort required could make this moderately challenging for less conditioned users. Thus, it aligns moderately with Moderate, and lightly with Challenging due to intervals.",
