  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the clear emphasis on a yoga flow practice, as stated in the title 'Rooftop Yoga Flow' and the description mentioning to share 'your practice with Owen during this flow.' The use of chill and downtempo music like tracks from Kygo, R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL, and Billie Eilish further supports a rhythmic and coordinated movement pattern, with a score of 0.9.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is also relevant here, albeit secondary, as the workout takes place on a helipad, an uncommon outdoor setting. Although not in a natural environment, the rooftop location adds an adventurous and explorative element to the session, supporting a score of 0.7. \n\nThe absence of cues indicating high intensity, a structured program, or restorative focus reduces the likelihood of other spirits. The 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits are the most fitting based on the metadata provided."
