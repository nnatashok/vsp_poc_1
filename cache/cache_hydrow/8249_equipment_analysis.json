  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata indicates that this workout is a 'Technique Cool-Down' with a focus on rowing, as suggested by the 'category: row' tag. The description mentions working on sequencing with your feet, knees, hips, core, and shoulders, which aligns with the biomechanics of rowing. Although the image shows rowing on water, the category suggests an indoor setting requiring a rowing machine. Therefore, a rowing machine is identified as necessary equipment with very high confidence (0.9), as it fulfills the workout\u2019s specific focus on rowing technique."
