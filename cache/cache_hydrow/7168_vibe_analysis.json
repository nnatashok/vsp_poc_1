  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Meditative Grind' due to the focus on repetitive rowing and the interval format that emphasizes cardio at a jog and run pace, combined with an intensity level of 1 out of 3 indicating a more mindful, sustained effort rather than high intensity. The title and description suggest a structured approach to focusing on different aspects, conducive to this vibe.\n\n'\"The Rhythmic Powerhouse' is chosen next due to the up-tempo playlist featuring tracks from artists like Kygo and Ed Sheeran, implying a strong musical component to the workout that drives the rhythm of the rowing. The music genre of Dance mid and Global Hits further supports a rhythmic and engaging experience.\n\nFinally, 'The Zen Flow' is selected for its focuses on breathing and intentionality ('Workout Type: Breathe') as well as the educational aspect of teaching about focus types, which together create a grounding, intentional, and somewhat meditative flow.\n\nOther potential vibes were excluded due to the low intensity and measured pacing which contradict more intense or explosive workout types."
