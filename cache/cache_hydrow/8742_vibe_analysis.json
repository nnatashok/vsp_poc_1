  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Light Effort Row' is characterized by low intensity and a steady rhythm, as indicated by the description 'stay at low rhythms and light effort' and 'format: steady'. This suggests a strong match with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, which fits endurance-based and repetitive workouts like rowing. The music genre includes tracks by popular artists Justin Bieber and David Guetta, which are generally upbeat but not intense, aligning somewhat with 'The Zen Flow' that emphasizes grounding and breath-centering movement. The intensity level is low (1 out of 3), and the playlist played includes tracks from 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits', hinting at a calm, yet slightly upbeat atmosphere, reinforcing the 'The Zen Flow' vibe but with less confidence. Other potential vibes like 'The Groove Session' were less applicable due to the focus on breathwork and low intensity."
