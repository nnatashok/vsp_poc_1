  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by high energy, as indicated by its intense format and music. It is described as \"HIIT\" with an intensity level of 3 out of 3, and it includes short burst intervals (15, 30, and 60 seconds), pointing to an intense nature. The playlist features energetic tracks from The Prodigy, enhancing the high-energy atmosphere, which justifies a strong match with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit (score: 0.9).\n\nThe video is set on a river, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Since the rowing session is recorded outdoors, this contributes significantly to the adventure aspect. The natural setting further supports this classification with a high score (0.85).\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are less evident as the focus seems more on intensity and the outdoor rowing experience. Therefore, they are not included in the final analysis."
