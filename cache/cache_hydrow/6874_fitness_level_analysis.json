  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 10:44 for a core strength workout signals moderate effort overall, as it is short but involves focus on core engagement, which can be somewhat demanding. The description with 'ignite your core' indicates that the exercises might be intensive enough to also touch on a 'Challenging' level for less fit users, but primarily, it's likely moderate given the short length and typical core workout intensity.",
