  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit identified for this workout is 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.9. The description highlights rowing along the Vltava River, suggesting an outdoor setting which is central to this spirit. The presence of natural scenery, like the hills of Prague, further supports this classification.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is a secondary spirit with a score of 0.55. The playlist includes songs that may promote a rhythmic flow, such as The Piano Guys' covers, which often have a smooth, flowing quality. This aligns with maintaining pace and coordination during the rowing session. \n\n'High-Energy & Intense' receives a score of 0.45 due to the interval format and categorization under 'sweat' and 'row', indicating a level of exertion that characterizes high-energy workouts. However, the intensity level is moderate (2 out of 3), hence it's not the dominant spirit.\n\nThe structured aspect of interval workouts doesn't dominate, given that the outdoor element is more prominent. Therefore, 'Structured & Disciplined' is not selected as a primary spirit."
