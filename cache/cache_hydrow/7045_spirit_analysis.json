  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a very high confidence score of 0.9. This classification is supported by the workout's name, 'Calming Restorative Yoga,' and description, which emphasizes calming both body and mind. The use of the word 'restorative' directly aligns with the spirit of recovery, relaxation, and stress reduction. \n\nFurthermore, the music genre 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' complements a relaxing atmosphere necessary for a restorative practice, further reinforcing this spirit categorization.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a moderate score of 0.4, as yoga practices often involve a degree of coordination and flowing movement sequences, even in restorative forms. However, the emphasis on calming and restorative qualities is predominant.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' do not apply due to the focus on relaxation and the indoor setting shown in the image."
