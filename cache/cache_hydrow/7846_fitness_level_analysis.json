  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout category is 'row', which limits the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. The description emphasizes maintaining rhythm during intervals, indicating a basic understanding of rowing technique is needed. Despite the presence of intervals, the emphasis on 'same split rowing' and an intensity level of 1 out of 3 suggest minimal complexity, aligning strongly with a Beginner level. There's less alignment with Intermediate due to the simplicity described.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a workout duration of under 17 minutes and an intensity level of 1 out of 3, the physical demand is low. The need for controlled effort and brief intervals suggests some increase in demand from absolute rest, but overall, it aligns more with Light effort due to the low intensity. There is moderate alignment with Moderate effort given the intervals and focus on rhythm control, indicating a weak but present physical challenge.",
