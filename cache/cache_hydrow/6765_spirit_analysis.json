  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to several explicit indicators. The title \"Bootcamp HIIT Row\" and description mention \"short intervals followed by quick recovery,\" suggesting a high-intensity interval training format. The maximum rhythm at 30 and intensity level 3 out of 3 further denote a strenuous session. The use of energetic music from dance and global hit radio stations enhances the intense spirit. \"Outdoor & Adventure\" is also applicable, as the session takes place on Indian Creek, a natural waterway. The image confirms an outdoor setting on a water rowing craft, justifying this classification. Overall, there is clear evidence for both spirits with high confidence due to the specific activities and environment described in the metadata."
