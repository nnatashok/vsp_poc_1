  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Whole Body Circuit' with intervals both 'off Hydrow' and 'on-Hydrow', indicating a mixture of rowing and other exercises, typical of high-intensity interval training. The use of equipment, specifically dumbbells, suggests strength elements combined with cardio intervals. The format 'EMOM' (Every Minute on the Minute) further supports a structured and disciplined approach, focusing on consistency and timing. The playlist, featuring high-energy tracks from artists like Drake and Nicki Minaj, aligns with a dynamic, high-energy vibe. Therefore, 'High-Energy & Intense' scores 0.75 due to fast-paced intervals and upbeat music, while 'Structured & Disciplined' scores 0.65 because of the EMOM format implying regimented exercise structure."
