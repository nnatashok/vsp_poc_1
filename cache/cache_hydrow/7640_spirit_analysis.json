  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title \"Hard, Harder, Hardest Row\" and the description suggest a structured approach with increasing difficulty, indicative of an interval-based flow. This implies a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the steady pacing between power strokes and intervals. The inclusion of world and global music further supports this, making it music-driven and coordinated. This spirit is assigned a score of 0.75.\n\nGiven the photo of rowing on a river, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is relevant. Physical environment influences the workout experience heavily, and combining rowing with natural scenery typically embodies this spirit. This spirit is strengthened by the environmental aspect and is assigned a score of 0.8.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit was considered, but the workout intensity level of 1 out of 3 suggests a more moderate session rather than an intensely challenging one."
