  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Meditative Grind' fits well due to the steady state nature of the rowing at rhythms 20 to 22, indicating a repetitive and focused workout, which is ideal for this vibe. The workout's goal to 'build your cardio base' suggests endurance and consistency, common traits of 'The Meditative Grind' (score: 0.8). 'The Zen Flow' is also applicable as the workout intensity level is low (1 out of 3), which typically offers a grounding and breath-centered experience. The category 'breathe' supports this calming aspect. However, since the music genre includes 90's hits and 'Global Hits,' it doesn't fully align with the calm criterion of 'The Zen Flow,' but does provide a gentle, steady beat (score: 0.6). The workout lacks high intensity or explosive elements, thus excluding more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.' Overall, the evidence strongly supports these calming, endurance-based vibes."
