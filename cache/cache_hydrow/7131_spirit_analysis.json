  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Power Row' emphasizes a 'fast sprint' for two 4-minute intervals, highlighting a high-intensity approach. This is further supported by the workout description and the maximum rhythm of 30, suggesting a fast-paced session. Additionally, the intensity level is marked 3 out of 3, indicating the workout's demanding nature, which aligns closely with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The choice of music, including upbeat tracks like 'Come On Eileen' and 'What I Like About You,' propels a lively and energetic atmosphere suitable for high-intensity efforts. The workout is conducted on the water, as seen in the photo, lending it an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The presence of rowing on a river environment suggests exploration and interaction with nature. While the main focus is on high intensity, the outdoor element is significant, albeit secondary, providing a balanced combination of energy and adventure."
