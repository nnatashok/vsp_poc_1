  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration of 5:45 coupled with the pilates workout type suggests a mostly Light effort difficulty, as pilates is typically low-impact and focused on core engagement rather than cardio intensity. Music style does not significantly impact effort here. While 'Core Burn' indicates some intensity, it aligns more with controlled exertion typical of Light effort than any real Moderate intensity, given its timing and succinctness.",
