  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which indicates the need for a rowing-focused exercise. The title 'February Race: Week 4 of 4', along with the description's phrase 'as you bolt toward Tampa Bay', suggests a rowing session meant to simulate a race or competitive scenario. The term 'Drive' is often associated with rowing workouts as it refers to the main part of the rowing stroke. Although no equipment is explicitly mentioned, these elements lead to a very high confidence that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
