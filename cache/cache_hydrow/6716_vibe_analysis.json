  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"The Zen Flow\" due to its focus on grounding and intentional movement. Evidence includes the cool-down nature of the session, the use of smooth vocals, and a gentle decline in rhythm, all of which suggest a calming, breath-centered experience. The music choice, including country and global hits like Chris Stapleton's 'Tennessee Whiskey,' further supports a tranquil vibe. A score of 0.8 reflects the strong alignment with this category. Additionally, the workout can be considered \"The Reboot Workout\" with a score of 0.7, as it involves low stress and total-body refreshing, characteristic of cool-downs. However, other vibes like \"The Meditative Grind\" were excluded due to the absence of repetitive or endurance training elements that typically define them."
