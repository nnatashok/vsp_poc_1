  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Calming Restorative Yoga' and categorized under 'On The Mat,' which strongly implies the use of a Mat for performing the exercises. This is corroborated by the visual evidence in the image showing a mat on the floor, used for comfortable positioning during yoga poses. The high confidence score of 0.9 reflects the explicit mention and common practice of requiring a mat for yoga sessions. No other equipment is indicated or implied in the metadata."
