  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This is a warm-up session lasting 5 minutes and 43 seconds with a steady rhythm of 20 strokes per minute. As it's intended to prepare the body gently for more demanding activity, the effort expenditure is minimal. The warm-up focus of the session suggests a very low-intensity activity meant to increase heart rate slightly without significant exertion. Thus, it aligns strongly with the Light effort difficulty classification.",
