  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Lower Body with Mini-Band Circuit,' explicitly mentions the use of a mini-band, indicative of resistance bands, which gives it a very high confidence score of 0.8. The description supports this by stating that bodyweight exercises will be performed with a mini-band, confirming the necessity of this equipment. The category 'On The Mat' suggests the use of a mat for performing exercises, although it is not explicitly mentioned, assigning a moderate confidence score of 0.7. The image shows a rowing machine being used, which, combined with the mention of finishing with 'Pete,' likely involves rowing, thus it's included with a high confidence of 0.8."
