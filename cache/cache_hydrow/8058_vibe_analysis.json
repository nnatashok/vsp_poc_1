  "vibesExplanation": "The workout title and description indicate an endurance-based rowing session on Norwegian culture, suggesting a \u2018Meditative Grind\u2019 vibe, especially since it involves climbing intervals, which align with repetitive and focused efforts. The moderately intense 16-minute duration and interval format reinforces this vibe (score: 0.7).\n\nSongs like 'Eple', 'What Is Love', and 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)' suggest a \u2018Nightclub Workout\u2019 vibe due to their dance and global hits styles, even though the workout is not dance-based. This offers an energetic backdrop to the session (score: 0.5).\n\nFinally, the inclusion of upbeat and electronic tracks creates a mood likely to evoke feelings typical of \u2018The Endorphin Wave\u2019 vibe, characterized by a steady, energizing build, suitable for a rowing session (score: 0.6). The metadata indicates a moderately intense workout, but lacks specific explosive or high-octane elements, reducing the likelihood of other more aggressive vibes being relevant."
