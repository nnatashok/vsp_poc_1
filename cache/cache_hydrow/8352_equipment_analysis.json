  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for this workout explicitly indicates that it is part of the 'row' category, denoting a rowing-type exercise. The title and description mention rowing specifically, such as 'row at low rhythms,' which demonstrates that a rowing machine is central to this workout routine. Even though the general cool-down nature of the workout could suggest more flexibility in equipment, the presence of the term 'row' with the category tag solidifies the necessity of a rowing machine with very high confidence (1.0). The photo further suggests rowing activity, reinforcing the interpretation that a rowing machine is essential for performing this workout."
