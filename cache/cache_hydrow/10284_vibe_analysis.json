  "vibesExplanation": "This workout can be best categorized under several vibes based on its structure and experience. Firstly, 'The Meditative Grind' is a strong fit (0.7) because the workout involves a rhythm climb and long intervals, which encourage a repetitive, endurance-focused effort. Secondly, 'The Endorphin Wave' is an even stronger fit (0.8) due to the steady build-up of intensity, culminating in a heart-pounding sprint, which aligns with the steady energy increase and feel-good movement qualities of this vibe. Additionally, the presence of dynamic coaching from an Olympic rower enhances this energy. Lastly, 'The Firestarter' captures the explosive end with a high-intensity sprint (0.5), which brings a short but intense burst, although the overall session isn't exclusively fast-paced. The absence of specific music genre details reduces precise classification confidence but the mention of 'Rock Mid-intensity, Global Hits' suggests a motivating backdrop supporting these vibes."
