  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata strongly indicates an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit for the workout 'Newport Harbor Stern View'. The workout description emphasizes exploring the shores of Newport Beach, California, which explicitly points to a nature-based and exploratory experience typical of Outdoor & Adventure workouts. The mention of a 'journey' in both the workout type and category further supports the adventurous spirit, as it suggests an exploratory or travel-oriented aspect. This aligns perfectly with the classification of rowing sessions recorded on rivers or in natural settings. There are no indications of high-energy, flow, structured discipline, soothing, or sports agility elements, leading to their exclusion. The confidence is rated very high at 0.95 due to the clear and explicit nature-focused and exploratory orientation of the workout."
