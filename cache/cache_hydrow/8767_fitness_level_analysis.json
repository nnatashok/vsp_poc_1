  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 30 minutes indicates a substantial amount of physical activity, leaning away from 'Light' effort. The session type 'journey' suggests a continuous physical exertion, typical for rowing at a reasonably steady pace. However, since no intensity cues are specified, it\u2019s assumed this is manageable for deconditioned users, thus aligning strongly with 'Moderate' and moderately with 'Challenging' levels.",
