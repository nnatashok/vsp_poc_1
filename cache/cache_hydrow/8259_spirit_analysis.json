  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit assigned is **Outdoor & Adventure** with a score of 1. This is due to the workout's setting in Prague, with rowing taking place outdoors on a river, as described by \"Prague Challenge Row\" and visually supported by the image. Such natural settings are quintessential embodiments of the Outdoor & Adventure spirit.\n\nThe second spirit is **High-Energy & Intense** with a score of 0.8. The workout is intense, as indicated by the \"maximum effort,\" a high max rhythm of 32, and an intensity level of 3 out of 3. It emphasizes driving power, which aligns with high-energy activities. The music choice with \"Dance high\" and \"Global Hits\" further complements a vigorous, fast-paced environment.\n\nThere is no indication of structured training protocols, soothing aspects, or sport-specific agility training which excludes the other spirits."
