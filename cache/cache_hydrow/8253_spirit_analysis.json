  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is characterized by '60-second intervals' and a max rhythm of '28,' indicating a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format. The 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3' further supports the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, which is scored at 0.9 due to these strong indicators of vigorous physical demand. The mention of music from energetic playlists like 'Pop high, Global Hits,' complements this intensity. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is moderately present, suggested by the continuous pace implied by interval timing and the music rhythm, scoring 0.5. However, rhythm is less emphasized in the primary metadata, so the score reflects secondary importance.\n\nSince the workout is visually conducted on a river, it aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The environment contributes to the adventurous nature of the workout, leading to a 0.6 score. Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are not applicable due to the workout's clear focus on intensity and outdoor adventure."
