  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which generally aligns with Beginner to Intermediate technique difficulty. Given the emphasis on building endurance and the use of a 'pyramid' format in rhythm and intensity, there may be slight complexity beyond basic rowing, warranting a consideration of Intermediate level, though the overall technique remains closer to Beginner exercises. The metadata lacks specific challenging technical details, which supports a higher alignment with Beginner level (0.8).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as building endurance and 'climbing in rhythm and intensity', indicating a moderate level of physical demand. The explicit intensity level is 2 out of 3, which suggests a workout that is physically engaging but not maximal exertion. The 31-minute duration also places it slightly above light effort, leaning towards Moderate difficulty. However, the 'sweat' workout type and pyramid structure suggests interval-based energy requirements, implying elements of Challenge, hence a consideration for both Moderate (0.8) and Challenging (0.5) levels.",
