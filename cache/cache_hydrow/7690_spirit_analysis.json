  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"High-Energy & Intense\" due to its high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format, as indicated by the \"Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3\" and the structured intervals (90\", 60\", 30\"). The upbeat playlist featuring songs that are energetically intense, such as \"Big Energy\" by Latto and \"In Da Club\" by 50 Cent, supports this classification. The score for this spirit is high at 0.8.\n\n\"Flow & Rhythm\" also applies with a moderate score of 0.6, given the emphasis on rhythm with a max rhythm of 32 strokes per minute, and the playlist's dance and global hits, which suggests a musical driving force that aids coordination.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is suggested by the image showing a river location and natural setting. This environment naturally lends itself to this category with a score of 0.7.\n\nOther categories such as \"Soothing & Restorative\" do not apply due to the high intensity and energetic music, while \"Structured & Disciplined\" is less emphasized despite the structured intervals, as the focus remains on energy and rhythm."
