  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a row session, which generally aligns with Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty. The rowing format mentioned here involves rhythm and intervals, which require some coordination but are inherently limited in complexity for technique, given rowing's straightforward nature. Hence, 'Beginner' is a strong fit, aided by cues like 'supportive, fun workout atmosphere'. However, intervals may slightly elevate this to 'Intermediate' for those less familiar with rhythm changes, justifying a score in this category too.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 11 minutes with increasing intensity intervals (4', 3', 2', 1') at a high max rhythm of 28 suggests a moderate to challenging workout. The description uses terms like 'sweat' and a mid-tier intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicating it may be moderately demanding for deconditioned users. The climbing format with intervals implies variations, likely elevating the effort difficulty to 'Challenging', especially as users push themselves in shorter, more intense bursts.",
