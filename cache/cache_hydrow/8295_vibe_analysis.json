  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Power Endurance Row' is classified as 'The Endorphin Wave' due to its focus on maintaining a 'consistent power level' with a 'varying rhythm'. This suggests a steady build and elevated energy typically associated with rowing endurance and the gradual intensity buildup akin to producing endorphins. The music genres like Indie Alternative and Global Hits contribute to this upbeat, feel-good vibe, indicated by songs such as 'Go Big or Go Home'. The assigned score of 0.7 reflects a strong fit due to these elements.\n\n'Power Endurance Row' also aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' because the description emphasizes endurance and rhythm, indicating repetitive and sustained effort over the 16 minutes. The use of rowing, categorized under 'standard' and 'endurance', supports this vibe, as it focuses on zoning in and maintaining a rhythm. The score of 0.6 reflects a moderately strong fit for this vibe.\n\nOther vibes were excluded due to lesser focus on intense competition, high unpredictability, or extreme explosiveness, which are not highlighted in the metadata provided."
