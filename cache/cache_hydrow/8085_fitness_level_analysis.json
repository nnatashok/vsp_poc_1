Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's short duration (5:42 minutes) and cool down categorization are strong indicators of a minimal energy expenditure nature, aligning with Light effort difficulty (0.95). The inclusion of 'steady row' suggests minimal physical demand, with possibly very mild exertion, hence a lower score for Moderate (0.3). Overall, the effort here is very low, ensuring it is suitable for individuals in poor physical shape.",
