  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Indian Creek Stern View,\" indicating a rowing session recorded on a body of water, Indian Creek. The description explicitly mentions a journey down Indian Creek and specifies the setting as a cloudy morning, directly aligning with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, which is strongly emphasized in river-based rowing sessions. The title and description convey a sense of exploration and nature connection. Additionally, the \"Category\" field puts it under 'Journeys', reinforcing the focus on the outdoor experience rather than intensity, flow, or discipline. No specific indicators found for the other spirits, thus they are excluded. The outdoor setting and nature-focused elements provide clear support for this spirit classification, justifying a high confidence score."
