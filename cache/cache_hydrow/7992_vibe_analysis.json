  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Cardio Interval Row,\" focusing on rowing intervals with a rhythmic shift, which aligns with \"The Meditative Grind.\" The session involves consistent cardio efforts seen in endurance-focused exercises. The vibe is reinforced by the moderate rhythm ranges and the aim to \"build your cardio,\" indicated in the description, suggesting a repetitive and immersive experience. \"The Meditative Grind\" score of 0.7 is justified by these elements of rhythm and endurance.\n\nSimultaneously, the music played\u2014ska and rock genres\u2014contributes to a feel-good, energetic atmosphere, aligning with \"The Endorphin Wave.\" This vibe captures the steady cardio escalation and the upbeat music. Given the low-intensity level and brief duration, this isn't an extreme energy workout, but it does capture the positive, sustained feel of \"The Endorphin Wave.\" Hence, it scores a 0.6.\n\nOther vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Firestarter\" were excluded due to the low intensity and lack of high-adrenaline elements."
