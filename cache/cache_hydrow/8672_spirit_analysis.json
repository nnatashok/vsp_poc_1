  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'March Race: Week 4 of 5' with a description emphasizing 'race' and 'maximum meters' strongly suggests a competitive and intense environment, aligning it with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The use of power format and maximum rhythm of 32, coupled with a top intensity level (3 out of 3), further underscores its demanding nature. The music choice, including tracks by 'The Offspring' and 'Jimmy Eat World', provides a high-energy backdrop to match this intensity.\n\nThe image shows rowing on a body of water, clearly indicating an outdoor setting. Combined with the context that the session is part of a race series, this supports the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit and highlights the exploration and nature-based aspect of rowing on a water route.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded due to the competitive and intense focus of the session, leaving little room for relaxation or smooth, flowing movement patterns. Thus, 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are the most fitting classifications."
