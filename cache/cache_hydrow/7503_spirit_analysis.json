  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under 'High-Energy & Intense' due to its interval structure with 2-minute high rhythm segments aimed at elevating heart rate, clearly indicating a high-energy session (score 0.8). The use of a rock playlist further enhances this spirit by promoting an energizing atmosphere. \n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant as the workout is set on a river, which aligns with nature-based elements (score 0.7). This outdoor setting adds an exploratory and environmental challenge aspect.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is somewhat present due to the rhythmic focus in the rowing (rhythms at 26 and 28) and music-driven pacing, despite the primary focus on intensity (score 0.5). \n\nThe presence of intervals and sweat category reduces the relevance of 'Structured & Disciplined,' making it less applicable in this context. Similarly, the workout lacks elements of recovery or sport-specific agility; thus, 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Sport & Agility' are not considered."
