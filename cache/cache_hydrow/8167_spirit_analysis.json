  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Resilience Row' reflects two primary spirits: 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Flow & Rhythm.' The image of rowing on a river strongly suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, which is further supported by the setting being in nature. The playlist, featuring songs like 'We Are Family' and 'On Top Of The World,' indicates an uplifting, rhythmic experience, aligning with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The description highlights intervals and climbing format, suggesting a focus on coordination and rhythm. The moderate intensity ('1 out of 3') alongside the motivation-focused description indicates a steady, flowing workout rather than a high-intensity session. Hence, while 'High-Energy & Intense' isn't a strong contender, the rhythmic and outdoor elements dominate the classification."
