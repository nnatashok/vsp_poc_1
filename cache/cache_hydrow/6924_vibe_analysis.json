  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is strongly characterized by its calm, intentional nature, hence the selection of 'The Zen Flow.' This is evident from the metadata indicating a 'flow' yoga session, the use of chill and downtempo music genres, and the scenic rooftop location at the Four Seasons in L.A. The title 'Rooftop Yoga Flow' and the description mentioning 'share your practice' support a grounding and intentional vibe, earning it a strong score of 0.9. Additionally, 'The Groove Session' is applicable due to the expressive and fluid nature of the yoga flow, along with the music from artists like Kygo and R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL. This gives it a supporting role with a score of 0.6."
