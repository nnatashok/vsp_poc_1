  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata categorizes this video as both a 'cool down' and a 'row', with the row emphasis suggesting a rowing-related activity. The title \"Pauses Cool-Down\" and description about honing technique imply a focus on rowing technique refinement. The image shows a person in a rowing scull, reinforcing the rowing aspect. Although the workout is a cool-down, which might traditionally not require equipment, the context heavily indicates the use of a rowing machine for proper technique practice. Hence, 'Rowing machine' is included with very high confidence."
