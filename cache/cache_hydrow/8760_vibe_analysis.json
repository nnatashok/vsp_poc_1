  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Confidence Builder Row' is characterized by a lower rhythm interval rowing session, led by James. The focus on 'build confidence stroke by stroke' along with the medium intensity level (1 out of 3) suggests a controlled, repetitive workout designed to enhance concentration and boost self-assurance. This aligns with 'The Meditative Grind,' which emphasizes zoning in, repetition, and endurance.\n\nGiven the categorization under 'breathe' and the description of 'breathe' and 'standard,' there's also a meditative, calming aspect to the workout, fitting 'The Zen Flow' vibe, which focuses on breath-centered and intentional movement.\n\nThe interval format and moderate max rhythm suggest a thoughtful and composed session, rather than an intense or fast-paced experience. Hence, high-energy vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded. The indie and global hits music further supports a reflective vibe, justifying scores of 0.8 for 'The Meditative Grind' and 0.6 for 'The Zen Flow.'"
