  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' (score: 0.7) due to the structured, classical nature of Pilates, which emphasizes smooth and continuous movement. The playlist includes remixes and dance tracks, suggesting a rhythmic, music-driven environment that aligns with this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, 'Outdoor & Adventure' (score: 0.9) is very prominent, as indicated by the setting in the historic Plaza del Patio de Banderas. This outdoor location provides a unique and explorative environment that is key to this spirit, and the image supports this classification.\n\nThe metadata focuses heavily on the Pilates structure, representative of Flow & Rhythm, but the prominent outdoor setting elevates 'Outdoor & Adventure' as the most dominant spirit."
