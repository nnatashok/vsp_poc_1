  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is predominantly Light because the workout prioritizes relaxing stretches for the hips, legs, and ankles. The short duration of 15 minutes and the nature of stretching do not demand high energy expenditure, aligning with Light effort. A slight presence of Moderate level is considered due to the potential engagement from targeted muscle stretches, but overall, it remains minimal.",
