  "spiritsExplanation": "The \"Confidence Builder Row\" workout primarily embodies the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit due to the rowing activity taking place outdoors on a river, as indicated by the provided image and the nature of the workout. This aspect scores a high 0.9 as it leverages the natural environment for the session. The \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit is also significant, scoring 0.7. This is derived from the focus on lower rhythms and building confidence stroke by stroke, suggesting a connection with the body's movement and rhythm, further supported by the indie alternative playlist that typically supports a smooth flow. Lastly, there's a mild \"Soothing & Restorative\" element with a score of 0.5, as the workout falls under a low-intensity \"breathe\" category, emphasizing recovery and confidence building, aligning with a gentle, meditative approach. \"Structured & Disciplined\" and \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirits are less relevant here due to the workout's low intensity and lack of a highly structured interval protocol."
