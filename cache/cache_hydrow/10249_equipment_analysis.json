  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description explicitly mentions the need for a mat and a resistance band, providing very high confidence scores of 1.0 for both. Furthermore, the presence of a 'Hydrow' is specifically noted, which refers to a rowing machine, confirming its necessity. This is reinforced by the image showing a rowing machine in use. Therefore, the rowing machine is also assigned a very high confidence score of 1.0. No dumbbells or other equipment are required, as stated in the description."
