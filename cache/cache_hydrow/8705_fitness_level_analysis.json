  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is short at 5 minutes and 35 seconds, aligning well with a 'Cool Down' category aimed at low physical exertion. The max rhythm of 24 further suggests a pace that is steady and relaxed. Given these factors, combined with the nature of a cool down session, the effort difficulty is best characterized as Light. There is a slight potential for Moderate effort due to steady rowing, but this is minimal.",
