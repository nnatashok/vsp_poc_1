  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Zen Flow' is chosen with a score of 0.7 due to the focus on a 'lower-body-focused yoga session.' The use of yoga blocks and keywords like 'align' suggest a grounding and intentional practice, which aligns with the 'Zen Flow' vibe. The chill and downtempo music further supports a calming, breath-centered session.\n\n'The Reboot Workout' is assigned a score of 0.6, as the workout is described as a stretch for the lower body, suggesting a refreshing and low-stress activity consistent with a total-body refresh vibe. The short duration and restorative focus complement this vibe.\n\n'The Comfort Moves' is considered with a score of 0.4 due to the gentle, non-intense nature of the session, indicating a safe, feel-good movement. However, the overall tone is more about alignment and flow than just comfort, hence the lower score."
