  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Steady Row' is best classified as 'The Meditative Grind' with a strong match score of 0.9 due to the low-intensity, long-duration nature of the rowing session, and its repetitive structure divided into three 15-minute pieces. The 90s hits and low-intensity level suggest a focus on zoning in and maintaining a steady rhythm, which supports this classification. 'The Groove Session' scores 0.7 since the playlist includes lively 90s hits like 'Wannabe' and 'U Can't Touch This,' contributing a fun, fluid vibe appropriate for groove-based workouts. Finally, 'The Endorphin Wave' receives a score of 0.6 due to the extended duration, steady build, and feel-good music potentially elevating energy levels gently over the session. The presence of a 'breathe' format and emphasis on a lower intensity further exclude more intense vibes, reinforcing these choices."
