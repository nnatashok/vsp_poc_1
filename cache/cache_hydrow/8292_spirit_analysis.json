  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit due to being set in the natural environment of English Bay in Vancouver. The presence of rowing on open water and the mention of navigating \"swells\" strongly indicates an adventurous, outdoor focus. This justifies a high score of 0.9 for this spirit. Additionally, the description of 1-minute intervals, coupled with the HIIT format, points to a \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit, emphasizing maximum effort and cardiovascular challenge, fitting a score of 0.8. The intensity level marked as 3 out of 3 further supports this classification. Other spirits, like \"Flow & Rhythm,\" are less applicable due to the emphasis on high intensity and interval training methods rather than continuous, smooth movement."
