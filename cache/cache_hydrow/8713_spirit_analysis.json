  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified dominantly as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 1. This is supported by the imagery showing rowing on a body of water and the description mentioning Newport Beach, indicating a natural, outdoor setting. The 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is also significant with a score of 0.7, as the workout involves intervals and features a playlist with upbeat, energetic music genres like dance and global hits, which are indicative of a high-energy atmosphere. Lastly, the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is present, scoring 0.6, due to the workout's association with rowing, a rhythmic sport, and the music-driven flow suggested by the playlist featuring remixes and strong rhythmic elements. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 also complements a blend of energy and rhythm, rather than extreme intensity."
