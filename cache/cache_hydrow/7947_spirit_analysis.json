  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Shortened Slide Row' emphasizes prioritization of form and technique, indicating a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. Phrases like 'prioritize your form' and 'develop quickness' suggest a methodical approach, supporting a score of 0.7 for this spirit. Additionally, the focus on rhythm with a max rhythm at 26 and the playlist featuring smooth pop hits align with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, earning it a score of 0.6.\n\nThe image shows the workout occurring on a river, and given that it involves outdoor rowing, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is highly relevant, scoring 0.8. The environmental setting supports exploration and connection with nature, which is typically part of this spirit.\n\nThe workout\u2019s intensity is relatively low, minimizing suitability for 'High-Energy & Intense'. The length and nature suggest a structured yet moderately rhythmic experience, excluding 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Sport & Agility' in this context."
