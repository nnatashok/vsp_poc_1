  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Commit to It Row' gains a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification (0.9) primarily from being conducted on the Charles River, as indicated by the description and visual evidence. The setting on the river directly aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. 'Flow & Rhythm' (0.7) is supported by the playlist and the use of pop music to set a consistent tempo, along with the medium rhythm pace noted (max rhythm: 26), resonating with continuous and smooth rowing movements. Lastly, the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit (0.5) is reflected in the low intensity level (1 out of 3) and the 'breathe' category, suggesting a focus on relaxation and stress reduction. The calm and approachable nature of the workout, combined with the leisurely soundtrack, fortifies this classification. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were not considered due to the clear absence of high intensity and sports-specific skills."
