  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout explicitly features high-intensity interval training, evidenced by terms like 'HIIT', '60-second intervals', and an 'intensity level' of 3 out of 3, aligning with the High-Energy & Intense spirit. The scoring for this spirit is very high at 0.9, given the strong indicators of vigorous exercise. Additionally, the location in Rio de Janeiro suggests an Outdoor & Adventure spirit. Even though the session likely occurs indoors, the thematic emphasis on a renowned outdoor destination like Rio contributes to this classification, earning it a score of 0.7. The lack of explicit mention of outdoor execution or nature-based elements prevents a higher score in this category. The combination of rowing, an experienced Olympic coach, and advanced fitness level requirement excludes Soothing & Restorative and Flow & Rhythm, as the workout focuses heavily on intensity and not on smoothness or relaxation."
