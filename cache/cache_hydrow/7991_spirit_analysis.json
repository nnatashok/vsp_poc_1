  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Structured & Disciplined' due to the mention of 'drills' and 'interval' format, which implies a methodical, organized approach to training. The inclusion of 'power strokes' also suggests a focus on technical precision. This spirit is matched with a score of 0.7 given the clear indicators of structured training.\n\nAdditionally, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is relevant because the image shows rowing in an outdoor river setting. This aligns with the environmental aspect of the spirit, scoring 0.65 as there are strong visual indicators even though the workout description doesn't explicitly focus on adventure elements.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is considered to a moderate degree due to the use of music during the session, which hints at a connection to rhythm, even in a warm-up context. The playlist including popular songs supports this, but it's scored lower at 0.5 due to the less explicit emphasis on continuous, seamless movement.\n\n'Sport & Agility,' 'Soothing & Restorative,' and 'High-Energy & Intense' were excluded due to the absence of elements like intense sport-specific training or recovery-focused content."
