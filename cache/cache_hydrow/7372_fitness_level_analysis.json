  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is approximately 20 minutes, which, combined with the phrase 'get your heart pumping,' implies a moderate cardiovascular and muscular demand. The focus on 'lower body exercise' in a continuous manner suggests a challenging level of pacing for deconditioned users, although not reaching high-intensity levels due to the absence of additional weight or equipment. Therefore, the effort level is moderately demanding, with a score of 0.7 for Moderate and 0.5 for Challenging, reflecting the fair intensity of the session.",
