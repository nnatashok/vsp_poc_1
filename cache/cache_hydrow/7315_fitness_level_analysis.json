Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is a cool-down phase, designed for low energy expenditure, as evidenced by the workout type and category descriptions. With a duration of 5:46, the workout is relatively short, and with a max rhythm of 20, it suggests a gentle pace. These elements indicate a 'Light' effort difficulty with a high score of 1.0 as it's intended for recovery or relaxation rather than significant physical exertion. There is no mention of intensity or high energy, supporting the light effort classification.",
