  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Instructional: Drive Through Your Feet' is clearly focused on technique and form, suggesting a 'Masterclass Workout' vibe. The description emphasizes 'proper foot placement and form' with an instructional approach, aligning well with the characteristics of a technique-driven and skill-building workout. The inclusion of a 'legs-only drill' further supports this, as isolating specific techniques often indicates a focus on skill development. Given this context, a score of 0.75 is assigned for a strong match.\n\nThe addition of a 'Meditative Grind' vibe is considered due to its categorization as a warm-up and the repetitive nature of the legs-only drill on a rowing machine. This suggests a potential for participants to zone in and let repetition take over. However, since the focus is more instructional than meditative, the score for this vibe is lower, at 0.6.\n\nThe use of Pop and Global Hits music genres supports creating a somewhat engaging atmosphere, yet doesn't strongly influence the vibe towards a more rhythmic or high-energy classification like a 'Nightclub Workout' or 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse.'"
