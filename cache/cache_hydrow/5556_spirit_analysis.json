  "spiritsExplanation": "The video primarily embodies 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence score of 0.9. The workout is explicitly described as a 'cool down,' emphasizing relaxation and recovery. The low rhythm (max 22) further supports a gentler pace, aligning well with restorative qualities. The duration of 5 minutes and 46 seconds along with the calming playlist featuring Maggie Rogers also suggest a focus on gentle winding down. The 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant, indicated by the workout taking place on the Charles River, with environmental elements like the bridge and water in the image. This context in combination with outdoor rowing provides a sense of exploration and connection with nature, justifying a score of 0.8 for this spirit. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the explicit 'cool down' nature and low-intensity focus."
