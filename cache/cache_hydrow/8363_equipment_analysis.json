  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata indicates a 'cool down' type, specifically involving practicing low rhythm strokes to activate the glutes and hamstrings. The category includes 'row,' which strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine for this activity. The image further confirms the use of rowing equipment, as it shows a person in a rowing position. The confidence level is set at 0.95 because the rowing machine is central to the workout's focus on technique and rhythm in rowing.\"}"
