  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The primary categorization of this workout is 'row', which suggests a technique difficulty level of Beginner to Intermediate. The workout focuses on a steady state rhythm between 22 and 24, which implies straightforward rowing without complex transitions or varied stroke requirements. Given the metadata's emphasis on a simple rhythm with a 'breathe' workout type, the technique requirement aligns more strongly with Beginner. The mention of basic rhythms and a 'steady' format further solidifies this assessment.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is relatively short at 16 minutes, and the workout is classified under 'breathe' with a low-intensity level of 1 out of 3. These factors indicate that the workout is designed to be low-intensity, aligning with a Light effort difficulty. The steady rhythm and music pacing provide a moderate intensity potential for deconditioned users, but overall, the combination of low intensity and duration supports a primarily Light effort classification, with some moderate elements due to continuous movement.",
