  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's title, 'Vltava River Bow View,' and the category attributes 'Journeys' and 'row' strongly suggest the session is designed to simulate rowing along the Vltava River. Although no specific equipment is mentioned in the description, the category 'row' mandates the inclusion of a rowing machine for a high-scoring confidence assignment. The workout seems structured as an indoor rower journey, focusing on the visual experience of historic sites in Prague. Therefore, a rowing machine is necessary for this immersive, simulated rowing exercise, leading to a very high confidence level of 0.9."
