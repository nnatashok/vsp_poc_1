Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is primarily 'Light'. The workout is a short, 5:51 warm-up, designed to progressively increase from very light pressure to max effort over a brief period. Although 'sprint effort' and 'max effort' suggest higher intensity, the brevity of the workout and its classification as a warm-up indicates that overall energy expenditure remains low. Additionally, short intervals and gradual intensity change support this lighter classification.",
