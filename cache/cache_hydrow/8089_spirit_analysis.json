  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata indicates a strong alignment with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the focus on 'flow' and smoothing movements as part of the workout description, supported by the music choice of Chill and Downtempo genres. This suggests an emphasis on coordinating movements with the rhythm, scoring a 0.8. Additionally, 'Soothing & Restorative' is relevant given the specific mention of 'restorative poses' to conclude the session. This highlights a focus on relaxation and grounding, earning a 0.7 score.\n\nWhile the workout takes place outdoors, the primary focus is on the flow and restoration rather than an exploration of the environment. However, the outdoor setting and the visible connection to nature's background justify a moderate score of 0.6 for 'Outdoor & Adventure.'\n\nOther spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined,' were excluded as the workout focuses more on relaxation and rhythm rather than intensity or strict routines."
