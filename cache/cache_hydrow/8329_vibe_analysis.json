  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Master the Movement Row' strongly suggests a focus on skill development and technique, making 'The Masterclass Workout' a primary vibe choice with a high score of 0.8. The emphasis on 'proper technique' and the presence of an instructor with a strong professional background in fitness further reinforces this vibe. The workout's description mentions a steady rhythm and a climb format, aligning with the methodical, repetitive nature characteristic of 'The Meditative Grind,' warranting a moderate score of 0.7. The 'breathe' workout type indicates a calming, less intense session, supporting this classification. Additionally, featuring a beginner fitness level and a focus on technique may suggest elements of 'The Foundation Builder,' focused on strengthening fundamentals, scoring it a moderate 0.5. Given the low intensity and the presence of 'pop low' and 'global hits' music, which is not intense or fast-paced, it does not suggest a highly energetic vibe like 'The Endorphin Wave' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.' The overall confidence in these classifications is 0.8 due to specific cues in the metadata."
