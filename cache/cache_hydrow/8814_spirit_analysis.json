  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video, titled 'Power Intervals Row', is indicative of a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to its focus on developing speed and power through short, demanding intervals of 1 to 2 minutes. The use of terms like 'sweat' and the maximum rhythm of 30 suggests a vigorous and fast-paced session, aligning strongly with high energy. The music genre plays radio stations like 'Rock Mid-intensity' and 'Global Hits', contributing to an energetic atmosphere, supporting this spirit with a strong confidence level of 0.95.\n\nAdditionally, the interval format and emphasis on building speed and power, combined with structured timing (1, 1.5, 2-minute intervals) and the involvement of an experienced instructor like James Dietz, reflect a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The description of James as a coach and athlete who focuses on technique and motivation further reinforces the structured nature of this workout, earning it a robust score of 0.7.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' were not chosen due to the lack of emphasis on music-driven pacing or smooth continuous movements. The absence of a calming or restorative focus also excludes 'Soothing & Restorative' as a suitable spirit."
