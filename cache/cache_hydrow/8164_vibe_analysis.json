  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Lower Body Strength with Bands' has elements that align with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The focus on building strength in the lower body with mini bands suggests a repetitive and zone-in character, typical of the Meditative Grind (score: 0.7). The 15-minute duration supports a focused and deliberate session. \n\nThe music playlist, which includes tracks like 'Going Out Of My Head' and 'All Four Walls', indicates a lively and rhythm-driven background, lending itself to 'The Groove Session' vibe. The dance and global hits provide a fun and engaging tone that complements the workout, though it may not fully dominate the experience (score: 0.6). \n\nOther vibes were considered but excluded due to the specific focus on strength and the absence of explosive, competitive, or euphoria-inducing elements."
