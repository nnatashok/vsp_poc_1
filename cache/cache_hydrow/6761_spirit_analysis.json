  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout has strong elements of both 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'High-Energy & Intense' spirits. \n\n1. **Outdoor & Adventure (Score: 0.9):** The title and description indicate that the workout is set on the Hillsborough River and involves exploring the city of Tampa. This suggests a nature-based, exploratory element typical of the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The presence of rowing on a river reinforces this classification.\n\n2. **High-Energy & Intense (Score: 0.8):** The description explicitly mentions a 'HIIT-style workout' with an intensity level of '3 out of 3', which implies a vigorous and challenging session, aligning with 'High-Energy & Intense'. The music genres like 'Dance high, Global Hits' further imply a fast-paced environment. \n\nThe combination of outdoor elements and high intensity punctuates these spirits as the most relevant, with less emphasis on other spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm', which would require more emphasis on coordination and smooth transitions rather than high intensity and adventure."
