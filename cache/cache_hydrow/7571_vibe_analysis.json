  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Welcome to Ireland Mobility' and described as focusing on 'whole body mobility' aligns well with 'The Zen Flow' vibe due to its grounding and intention-based characteristics, combined with breath-centered exercises. The use of pop and global hits, along with Irish artists, complements a relaxed yet upbeat atmosphere, reinforcing this vibe. The outdoor setting in Ireland emphasizes a calming experience. 'The Reboot Workout' is also a strong match, given the focus on mobility and the soothing nature of the environment, which suggests a total-body refresh approach. 'The Groove Session' is a moderate match because of the rhythmic, music-infused feel from the playlist, though less prominent than the other vibes due to the primary focus on mobility and calmness. The confidence level is 0.75, reflecting clear indicators for the selected vibes from the description and music choice."
