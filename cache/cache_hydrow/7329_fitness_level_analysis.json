  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration of 5 minutes and 43 seconds with a cool-down focus signifies low energy expenditure suitable for Light Effort Difficulty. The steady pace noted in 'Max rhythm: 22' and the purpose of helping to 'cool down' further justifies a maximal alignment with Light intensity, providing active recovery with minimal physical strain, potentially slightly challenging for a complete beginner, but primarily falls under Light effort.",
