  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is described as 'Beginner Yoga Align,' indicating a focus on alignment and gentle movement, which aligns well with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit (score: 0.85). The playlist includes chill and downtempo music, supporting a calm and relaxing atmosphere. The setting on the shores of Mother's Beach contributes to a tranquil environment conducive to restoration.\n\nFurthermore, the workout takes place outdoors on a beach, connecting it to an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.8). Being conducted in a natural setting enhances the outdoor and exploratory aspect of the session. The visual of participants positioned on a beach further confirms this classification.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility,' are excluded due to the focus on gentle movement and relaxation rather than intensity or athletic performance. The emphasis on alignment rather than structured progression also makes the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit less relevant."
