  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as \"High-Energy & Intense\" with a score of 0.9 due to its format as a HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) session, which focuses on high-effort intervals (30 and 60-second intervals) maximizing exertion. The term \"sweat\" in the description and category further emphasizes the intense nature. The \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit is scored at 0.7 due to the emphasis on climbing in rhythm, indicating a strong connection to the music and pacing, especially with a max rhythm intensity. The hip-hop music genre supports this fluidity and synchronized movement. Additionally, the presence of an outdoor rowing environment suggests an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit, albeit to a slightly lesser extent (scored at 0.6). This aspect is less emphasized in metadata given the workout's focus on intensity and rhythm, but still relevant due to the imagery provided."
