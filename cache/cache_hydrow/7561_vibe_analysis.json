  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is centered on rhythmic and paced rowing intervals, suggesting a strong element of 'The Meditative Grind' (0.7). The repeated 3.5-minute intervals imply a focus on getting into a zone and sustaining effort, fitting well with this vibe. \n\nThe use of music from artists like Queen and Survivor, known for energetic and motivational tracks, suggests 'The Endorphin Wave' (0.6) as another suitable vibe. These tracks create a sense of steady but uplifting energy throughout the workout, supporting a feel-good, energizing experience. The climbing format and mid-intensity level further emphasize a sustained build in energy and performance.\n\nThe absence of intense competition or explosive elements excludes vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.' Instead, it leans more towards consistency and rhythm, aligning better with meditative and enduring vibing elements."
