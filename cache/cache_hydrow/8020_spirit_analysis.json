  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a confidence score of 0.9 due to explicit indicators like 'fast-paced,' '15-seconds to give it all you've got,' and the high-intensity playlist featuring energetic rock music, which suggests a vigorous session. It fits the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit strongly with a score of 0.8, as the workout happens 'along the Charles,' suggesting an outdoor rowing activity. The image also supports this outdoor classification. 'Sport & Agility' is included with a moderate score of 0.6 because of the athletic nature of rowing, the involvement of timing (15-second bursts), and a high rhythm of 34, indicating an emphasis on speed and agility. 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Flow & Rhythm' were considered less relevant due to the HIIT format and lack of specific content focused on flow or technique."
