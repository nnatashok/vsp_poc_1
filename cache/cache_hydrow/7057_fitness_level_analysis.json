  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', which typically means the technique difficulty should fall into Beginner or Intermediate levels according to Hydrow rules. The metadata indicates an 'Interval' format, which might involve changes in pace but does not inherently increase technique complexity. Given the 21:33 duration with a rhythm of 26 and the instructor's expertise, there is a likelihood for some technical coaching that elevates the complexity slightly. Therefore, a Beginner to Intermediate classification is appropriate, with more emphasis on Beginner due to the general nature of rowing for beginners.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity level is indicated as 2 out of 3, which suggests a moderate intensity. The 21:33 duration of interval rowing contributes to a substantial cardiovascular effort, classifying it under Moderate difficulty for effort. The rhythm of 26 is brisk and likely to be physically taxing, especially with intervals, so it's borderline Challenging. Therefore, it is appropriate to list both Moderate and Challenging with a stronger emphasis on Moderate considering the target user base typically has lower fitness levels.",
