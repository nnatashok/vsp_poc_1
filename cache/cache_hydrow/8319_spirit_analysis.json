  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is predominantly classified as \"Outdoor & Adventure\" due to the rowing environment observed in the image, which depicts outdoor activity on a river. This aligns with the spirit intended for open, nature-based settings. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicates a significant energetic component but without pushing intensity to the peak, which is why it's secondary to the outdoor aspect (Score: 0.9).\n\n\"Flow & Rhythm\" is also strongly present, supported by the music-driven nature of the session. The playlist includes upbeat, well-known tracks like \"I Will Survive\" and \"Hips Don't Lie,\" which encourage synchronization of rowing strokes with rhythm and enhance the mind-body connection (Score: 0.7).\n\nThe \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit was considered but not chosen as a primary classification due to the moderate intensity level and shorter duration, which do not indicate maximum effort throughout. The focus seems more on enjoyment and connection with the environment and music."
