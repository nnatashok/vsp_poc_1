  "vibesExplanation": "The workout focuses on 'Hip Mobility,' which suggests a calming and restorative session aimed at improving joint flexibility and reducing tension. The phrase 'great before any rowing or strength workout' indicates it serves as a preparatory routine, typical of 'The Reboot Workout,' focusing on low stress and total-body refreshment. The choice of songs from a relaxed dance and pop playlist, like 'Save Tonight' and 'Magnets,' contributes to a light, soothing atmosphere, aligning with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The workout's duration of just over 10 minutes and being categorized as 'on the mat' also support these vibes. While the music leans towards creating a mildly energetic environment, it mostly complements a calming, restorative session. The confidence is moderate, with possible ambiguity due to the music choice, which hints at a slightly elevated tempo."
