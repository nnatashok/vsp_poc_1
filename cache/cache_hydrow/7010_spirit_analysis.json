  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout name, 'Upbeat Yoga Flow,' and the description mentioning a 'brisk flow' and 'upbeat playlist' clearly point to a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. This is further supported by the music selection, with songs from artists like Autograf and Koffee, which likely provide a rhythmic and upbeat tempo conducive to continuous movement. Hence, a strong match score of 0.9 is given for 'Flow & Rhythm.'\n\nThe image shows the workout being conducted outdoors in a snowy setting, which aligns with an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The classification of 'on-the-mat' doesn't contradict this as the natural environment adds an adventurous element to the session. Thus, a decent match score of 0.7 for 'Outdoor & Adventure' is appropriate.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Soothing & Restorative,' are less applicable due to the emphasis on flow and rhythm without indications of either extreme exertion or relaxation-focus."
