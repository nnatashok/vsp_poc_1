  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Post-Row Mobility' with a focus on 'back and hip mobility' strongly suggests elements of 'The Reboot Workout' and 'The Zen Flow'. The nature of mobility work aligns with a 'total-body refresh,' a hallmark of 'The Reboot Workout,' giving it a high confidence score of 0.9. Terms like 'mobility' and 'ideal for after any row' indicate a restorative and refreshing session. Additionally, the inclusion of calming, relatively upbeat tracks from artists like 'Earth, Wind & Fire' and 'Barry Manilow' accompanied by a 'Pop low' radio suggests a peaceful, groove-oriented ambiance, supporting a secondary vibe of 'The Zen Flow' with a score of 0.7. This vibe encompasses intentional, breath-centered movements, albeit with a hint of rhythm due to the music choice. The brief duration also supports a focused, accessible session, compatible with these vibes."
