  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is a foam roller stretching session focused on relieving tension in the back, making 'The Reboot Workout' a primary vibe. This is supported by the emphasis on stretching, relaxation, and a gentle, low-stress workout. The duration of just over 10 minutes also fits the concept of a quick recovery session. The inclusion of upbeat music like 'Jubel' and 'This Girl' introduces a slight energetic element, suggesting 'The Zen Flow' as a secondary vibe, balancing grounding and breath-centered movement with a hint of dance-like motion. However, the primary focus remains on stretching and refreshment, thus 'The Reboot Workout' scores higher."
