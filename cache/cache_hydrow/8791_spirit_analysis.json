  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the setting on a river, which aligns with adventure and nature-based experiences. This is supported by the visual context of rowing on a natural water body. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant given the music playlist featuring upbeat, rhythmic songs like 'Higher Love' and 'Dancin (Krono Remix),' supporting a connection to movement and tempo.\n\nThe mention of intervals and maximum rhythm components also tie into a rhythmic flow, but aren't overly intense or structured, making 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'High-Energy & Intense' less applicable. The workout's focus on happiness and well-being, alongside the spirited music choice, emphasizes more on the element of enjoyment and rhythm rather than strict intensity or structure, supporting these classifications."
