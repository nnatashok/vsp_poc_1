  "spiritsExplanation": "The classification of the workout as 'Outdoor & Adventure' is driven by the title 'Lake Tahoe Stern View' and the description that emphasizes rowing along a notable natural location, Lake Tahoe. The mention of 'bright, blue sky and mountain view' further accentuates the environmental aspect typical of outdoor adventure workouts. The 'journey' workout type reinforces the exploration element. The absence of specified music indicates a focus on the natural environment rather than rhythm or intensity. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong alignment with 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the natural, outdoor setting and focus on the scenic experience. No indicators of high energy, rhythm, structure, restoration, or agility are present; thus, other spirits were excluded. The confidence score is moderately high, based on explicit mentions of nature and journey."
