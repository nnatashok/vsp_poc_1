  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is clearly a cool-down focused session, as indicated by the title and description. 'Reflective Cool-Down' suggests a slower pace and introspective feel, aligning well with 'The Reboot Workout' which emphasizes a low-stress total-body refresh. The rock music playlist adds a unique twist, still keeping it energizing yet relaxed, which fits 'The Zen Flow' vibe with breath-centered and intentional movement. \n\nExplicit lyrics and rock music might seem intense, but the context of a cool-down and the reflective nature of the session keeps it calming.\n\nThe max rhythm of 22 and the duration of around 10 minutes support a gentler pace. The lack of explicit intensity or high energy elements excludes options like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter,' reinforcing confidence in the selected vibes."
