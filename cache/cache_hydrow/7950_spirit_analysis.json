  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Power + HIIT Row' is classified predominantly as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to its interval format and high-intensity level explicitly mentioned in the metadata. Phrases like 'sprint pace for 4-minute intervals followed by high-intensity intervals' strongly suggest a demanding and vigorous session, justifying a perfect score of 1.0 for this spirit. Additionally, the exercise setting depicted in the provided image, a rowing scenario on a natural body of water, aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, which is why it also earns a score of 0.7. While the structured format and interval training could imply 'Structured & Disciplined', the emphasis on intensity and outdoor execution downplays its relevance. The playlist, featuring upbeat global pop hits, further complements the intense and energetic aspect of the workout by maintaining a lively pace and rhythm."
