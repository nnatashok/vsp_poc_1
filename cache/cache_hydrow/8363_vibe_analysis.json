  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe as the primary choice. The description emphasizes low rhythm strokes and focuses on relaxing stretches (activating glutes and hamstrings), which align with this vibe. The use of calming pop music also supports this classification, lending to a rejuvenating feel. A score of 0.8 reflects strong alignment.\n\n'The Zen Flow' is a secondary vibe. The emphasis on a gentle, intentional pace (low rhythm strokes) and an instructor named Aisyah guiding the practice suggest a methodical and calming experience. This is given a score of 0.6 due to its presence, but less emphasis compared to 'Reboot'.\n\n'The Meditative Grind' is another potential vibe, as the repetitive nature of rowing and the consistent focus on technique can put participants in a meditative state. However, since it's a cooldown, the intensity is lower, leading to a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nThe analysis excludes higher intensity or competition-focused vibes due to the cooldown nature and musical tone."
