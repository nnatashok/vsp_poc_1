  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Advanced Whole Body Circuit' workout features a circuit format with explicit songs, hinting at a focused and intense atmosphere typical of 'The Disciplined Grind.' The use of dumbbells and EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute) elements emphasize repetitive endurance and strength, supporting this classification with a high confidence (0.8).\n\n'The Warrior Workout' is another fit due to the high-energy rock playlist, including artists like blink-182 and Fall Out Boy, which can fuel a powerful, primal energy. The 1-minute on-Hydrow intervals and whole-body emphasis align with the demanding nature of a warrior-themed workout (score 0.7).\n\nLastly, 'The Adrenaline Rush' matches the dynamic and unpredictable challenges posed by alternating on/off-Hydrow work and the fast-paced rock music driving intensity, though confidence is slightly lower (0.6) as this vibe is more associated with extreme, unpredictable activities. Other potential vibes, such as 'The Competitor,' were excluded due to the lack of gamified or leaderboard-driven elements."
