  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title \"Rainy Cardio Row\" and the category \"row\" explicitly indicate that a rowing machine is central to this workout. The description mentioning \"cruise at lower rhythms and then bump up your rhythm for short bursts\" suggests interval training typically performed on a rowing machine. Additionally, the reference to \"exploring in Alaska\" implies a rowing-like activity, reinforcing the need for a rowing machine. Given these details, the confidence level is very high (1.0) that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
