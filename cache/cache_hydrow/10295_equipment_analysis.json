  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Competitive Reflections Row' and is categorized under 'row,' which strongly indicates the need for a rowing machine. The description emphasizes rowing terminology such as 'building rhythm and speed' and 'bursts of intensity,' which are indicative of a rowing workout. Furthermore, the workout is led by Aisyah Rafaee, Singapore's first Olympic rower, underscoring the focus on rowing. The mention of 'Hydrow Games' also suggests a direct association with rowing, specifically using the Hydrow rowing machine. Based on these details, the confidence level for the rowing machine requirement is very high at 0.9."
