Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is approximately 21 minutes, which suggests a low-to-moderate effort level, suitable for light to moderate energy expenditure. The workout type is a 'journey', typically focusing more on experience rather than intensity. The max rhythm of 22 indicates a steady and controlled pace, aligning with a lighter effort demand. However, as it's longer than a brief session, it suggests a bit more than purely light effort, justifying a low-to-moderate classification.",
