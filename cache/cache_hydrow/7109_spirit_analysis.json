  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the focus on Sun Salutations, which involves smooth, continuous movements that require coordination and align with the pacing of music. The description emphasizes movement and alignment, indicating a moderate match (0.7) with this spirit. 'Soothing & Restorative' is also relevant as the session is likely gentle and focuses on alignment, making it suitable for relaxation and mind-body connection, scoring a 0.6. The music tracks like 'Dreams' by Fleetwood Mac contribute to a calming atmosphere. \n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is noted because the session visibly takes place outdoors in snow-covered scenery, which enhances the adventurous aspect even within a regular on-the-mat practice. This matches with a score of 0.65, as the natural environment contributes to the experience. Other spirits were excluded as there is minimal indication of intense, structured, or sport-specific elements in the metadata."
