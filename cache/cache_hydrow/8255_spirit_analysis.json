  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title \"Open Rhythm Row\" and description \"listen to your body... open rhythm\" suggest a connection with the body's natural flow and rhythm, supported by the Soul/Funk/Disco music genre. This aligns strongly with the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit, scoring 0.8.\n\nThe mention of being outside on a river supports the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit, scoring 0.7, as this uses the natural environment and adds an exploratory dimension to the workout.\n\nThe \"Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3\" and interval format imply a high intensity level, contributing to the \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit, scoring 0.6. However, the presence of diverse music genres and \"open rhythm\" softens the pure intensity classification.\n\nOverall, \"Flow & Rhythm\" and \"Outdoor & Adventure\" take precedence, with \"High-Energy & Intense\" as a secondary influence."
