  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout belongs to the 'row' category and is described as a cool-down session intended for after rowing, as indicated by 'feel better on your next row.' This strongly suggests that a rowing machine is integral to the workout. Additionally, the image provided shows a person using rowing equipment. Thus, there's very high confidence that a rowing machine is required for this workout, although it may primarily involve stretching post-rowing."
