Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout duration of only 10:15 minutes and the 'journey' type, which is typically more about experience than intensity, the effort difficulty is mostly light. Journeys focus on scenery and exploration rather than high intensity. There might be a slight aspect of moderate effort due to the physical nature of rowing, but this is a weak alignment given the shorter duration and lack of intensity cues.",
