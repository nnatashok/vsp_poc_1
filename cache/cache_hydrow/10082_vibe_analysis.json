  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Holding Your Power Row' is primarily classified as 'The Meditative Grind' due to its focus on sustaining power through rhythm shifts ('work on sustaining your power as your rhythm shifts'), a characteristic of endurance-based rowing sessions. The mention of 'intervals' suggests repetitive physical motions, fitting the vibe of getting into a meditative state through sustained effort. The vibe score of 0.7 reflects this strong alignment. \n\nThe second vibe, 'The Endorphin Wave', is suggested due to the 'feel-good, high-energy workouts' described in the metadata, supporting a dynamic, uplifting experience despite the intermediate intensity level (2 out of 3). The high-energy tone aligns with the uplifting music genre (Pop mid, Global Hits), contributing to a sense of elevated energy and endorphin release. The endorphin wave description emphasizes a steady build, which is congruent with the rhythm shifts and endurance aspect of this rowing workout. The score of 0.6 indicates that while there\u2019s a strong presence of this vibe, it's slightly overshadowed by the predominance of a meditative, rhythmic focus."
