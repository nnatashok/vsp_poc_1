  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is a cardio intervals row, described as elevating the heart rate with rhythm shifts and led to a sweat-inducing intensity. The presence of energetic songs like 'Party Rock Anthem' and 'I Love It' paired with dance music playlists lends the workout a 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe (0.7), as it hints at a fun and rhythmic atmosphere typical of a dance or rhythm-based workout. \n\nThe rhythmic nature and interval format also suggest elements of 'The Meditative Grind' (0.6), as rowing itself typically involves repetitive, rhythm-based movement, characteristic of long-form endurance workouts. The overall pacing and intensity (level 2 of 3) alongside the mid-length duration imply a consistent, engaging rhythm, supporting this classification.\n\nLastly, 'The Endorphin Wave' (0.5) fits as the workout seems designed to elevate energy and mood as indicated by its upbeat playlist and energetic focus as a 'sweat' workout. The use of popular, feel-good hits suggests an emphasis on generating a positive and motivating atmosphere."
