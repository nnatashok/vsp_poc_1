  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Precision Power Row,' explicitly indicates that it is a rowing-focused routine. The metadata categorizes it as a 'row' type, which strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine as a core component of the workout. Additionally, the description emphasizes 'rowing wisdom,' 'building strength through rowing,' and so forth, highlighting the centrality of the rowing machine. Given the consistent focus on rowing throughout the metadata and the category type 'row,' the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high at 1.0, as it is essential for performing this workout accurately and effectively. No other equipment is explicitly mentioned or implied in the metadata."
