  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Be Present Row' strongly embodies 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its focus on presence with emotions, building cardio base, and low rhythm steady-state rowing. The calm and repetitive nature of the workout, along with a max rhythm of 24, supports this classification. Soul/Funk/Disco music contributes a mellow backdrop, enhancing the meditative experience, hence an 0.85 score.\n\n'Zen Flow' is also applicable as the workout promotes a sense of mindfulness and intentionality in both exercise and music choice. The descriptor 'be present' and a focus on 'breathe' resonate with 'The Zen Flow' qualities. This vibe scores 0.7 due to the moderate intensity level and music contributing to a grounding experience, but lacks slow-flow elements.\n\n'Endorphin Wave' earns a 0.5 score as the music's influence\u2014a mix of uplifting soul hits\u2014may create a feel-good rhythm and sustained energy throughout the session. Though less intense, the slow build and steady rowing pace might invoke a mild endorphin release."
