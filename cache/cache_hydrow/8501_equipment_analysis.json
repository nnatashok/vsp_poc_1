  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row,' which indicates the use of a rowing machine is central to this activity. The title 'Vltava River Bow View' and the description 'Escape to the pristine waters of Prague on a sunny day' suggest a rowing journey rather than an actual location, implying the use of a rowing machine to simulate the experience. The category explicitly includes 'row,' further solidifying the requirement for a rowing machine with very high confidence. There is no mention of any other equipment, and the use of a rowing machine aligns perfectly with the theme and type of workout described."
