  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty of this workout, categorized under 'row', is predominantly Beginner, with potential for Intermediate due to the 'climb' format. Rowing inherently involves basic repetitive motions which align with Beginner level, and the inclusion of rhythm-based intervals ('Rhythm Shift') could suggest some coordination effort, pushing it slightly towards Intermediate. Therefore, it scores strongly for Beginner (0.8) and moderately for Intermediate (0.6).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The Effort Difficulty for this workout is primarily Moderate due to its 16-minute duration and format (combining cardio and strength elements). The 'sweat' workout type and a max rhythm of 26 suggest a moderately intense session, suitable for those slightly above a complete beginner. The instructor's focus on entertainment over hard exertion, coupled with a 2 out of 3 intensity rating, makes it somewhat physically demanding but not extreme. This results in a strong alignment with Moderate (0.7) and a moderate fit for Challenging (0.5).",
