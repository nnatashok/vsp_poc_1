  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Climbing HIIT Row' is predominantly classified under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to several factors. The title and description indicate a HIIT format with '1-minute sprints' and 'max pace,' suggesting a focus on pushing limits and maximum effort. The workout intensity level is rated 3 out of 3, reinforcing the high-energy nature of the session. Additionally, the music playlist, featuring high-energy tracks like 'Don't Start Now' and 'Yeah!' further supports this classification.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant because the image shows rowing taking place on a river. This natural setting enhances the outdoor adventure quality, leveraging the environment for the workout.\n\nModerate confidence is maintained due to explicit indicators in both the metadata and visual context, offering strong evidence for the chosen spirits. Other potential spirits, like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative,' are excluded due to lack of relevant elements such as smooth movement patterns or relaxation focus."
