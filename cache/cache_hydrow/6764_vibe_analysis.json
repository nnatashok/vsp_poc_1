  "vibesExplanation": "The workout title 'Technique + Stretch Cool-Down' and description emphasize proper form and technique, which aligns with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe focused on skill-building and technique. The assignment of this vibe is further supported by the presence of instructors Laine and Nick, indicating a teaching aspect. The dance and global hits music imply a slightly upbeat and refreshing nature, complementing a cool-down session. Thus, 'The Reboot Workout' vibe fits well with the cool-down category, representing a total body refresh. The short duration and focus on stretches add to this justification. The scores of 0.7 and 0.65 reflect these matches with moderate to high confidence. Other vibes like 'The Zen Flow' were considered but excluded due to the stronger emphasis on technique and refreshment rather than grounding or breath-centered movement."
