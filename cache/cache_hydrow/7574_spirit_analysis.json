  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout named 'Core Burn Express' is primarily classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.8. This decision is mostly driven by the setting, as the workout takes place outdoors by a scenic river, emphasizing a connection to nature, which is key to this spirit.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' receives a score of 0.7. The playlist features popular tracks like 'Heat Waves' and 'Came Here For Love,' which suggests a rhythm-driven session typical of pilates, where music enhances the flow and coordination of movements.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is applicable with a score of 0.6 due to the nature of pilates being a methodical approach to core strengthening, requiring balance and precision, as described in the workout.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit was not chosen due to the workout's moderate intensity and focus on core strengthening rather than high-intensity cardio. 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Sport & Agility' were also excluded as the workout emphasizes challenge and core strengthening rather than relaxation or sports-specific skills."
