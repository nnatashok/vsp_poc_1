  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout session 'Steady Climb Row' predominantly embodies the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (0.8) and 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (0.7). The title indicates a connection to nature with the phrase 'glide along the Charles River,' supported by the visual evidence of rowing on a river, aligning well with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is reflected in the description's emphasis on 'rhythm and intensity' and 'steadily climb,' suggesting a focus on continuous, smooth movement, matching the music-driven pacing associated with songs like 'Everybody Wants To Rule The World' and 'Cool Kids.' The moderate intensity level (1 out of 3) further aligns with these spirits, focusing more on rhythm and exploration than high-exertion. Other spirits were considered less relevant due to the nature-focused and rhythm-based elements of this session."
