  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Years End Row' has elements of 'The Endorphin Wave' and 'The Nightclub Workout.' The use of 45-second intervals indicates a rhythmic, steady energy, aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave.' The high-intensity level (3 out of 3) further supports this vibe, as it typically involves an elevated, feel-good movement and a steady build in energy. The playlist, featuring upbeat and well-known tracks such as 'Celebration' and 'Wake Me Up,' contributes to a euphoric atmosphere, matching 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe, with its emphasis on music-driven, full-body enjoyment. The mix of indie alternative and global hits infers a lively, festive mood, enhancing this vibe. While the HIIT format suggests intensity, the music's celebratory nature and the workout's special occasion setting reduce the likelihood of other vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter.' The confidence is high due to explicit indicators in the description and playlist, though some ambiguity remains due to the unspecified music genre."
