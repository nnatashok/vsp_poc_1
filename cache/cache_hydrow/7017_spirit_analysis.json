  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Endurance Intervals Row\" suggests an emphasis on building endurance through intervals, indicating a mix of intensity and sustained effort. The use of high-energy music with songs like 'Believer' by Imagine Dragons supports a motivating and vigorous session, aligning with a High-Energy & Intense spirit (score: 0.7). The description uses 'sweat' and 'endurance,' implying considerable physical exertion.\n\nThe image and setting on the water elevate this to include Outdoor & Adventure (score: 0.75). The rowing on a river indicates interaction with natural environments, fitting the criteria well.\n\nThe structured interval format suggests some elements of discipline, but the focus on intensity and environment was stronger, thus 'Structured & Disciplined' was not assigned. The overall confidence is bolstered by explicit mentions in the metadata, but music specificity prevents maximum confidence."
