  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Fix Your Posture' and categorized under 'on-the-mat' and 'mobility' suggests a focus on gentle movements and alignment. The description 'Practice mobility with Peter as you fix your posture for everyday life' emphasizes daily functionality and gradual improvement, which aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The absence of high-intensity terms and equipment further strengthens this classification, leading to a strong score of 0.8.\n\nThe use of 'Indie Alternative, Global Hits' suggests a possible flowing, music-driven environment. Combined with light mobility focus, this supports a partial 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, but without explicit evidence of continuous movement patterns, this is rated at 0.5.\n\nOverall, 'Soothing & Restorative' is the dominant spirit due to the gentle and corrective focus."
