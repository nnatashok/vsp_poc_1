  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'drive' which suggests a complex technique typically aligned with Advanced difficulty as per Hydrow's specific rules. The HIIT format and involvement of rhythm (max 34) indicate coordinated and technically challenging movements, suggesting a strong alignment with Intermediate difficulty. However, given the 'drive' category, it can also reasonably be considered as Advanced with a slightly lower score.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The HIIT format and the workout's designation of an intensity level of 3 out of 3 imply a high-intensity workout demanding substantial physical effort. The duration of approximately 16 minutes suggests a demanding session, while the 'drive' category confirms an intense effort level. This justifies a classification as Challenging with some alignment with Extreme effort difficulty due to the shorter rest periods and high energy expenditure.",
