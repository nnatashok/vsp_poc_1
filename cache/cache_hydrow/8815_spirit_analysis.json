  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to explicit mention of 'high-intensity intervals,' which indicates a focus on pushing limits and maximum effort. The title 'Club 30 Row' and description phrases like 'step on the gas' and 'crush 30 and 60-second intervals' reinforce the intense nature of the session. Aquil Abdullah's background as an Olympian and national team member, coupled with the highest workout intensity level (3 out of 3), further supports this classification. The use of HIIT format is a clear indicator of high-energy efforts, justifying the strong score of 1.0 for this spirit.\n\nThe secondary spirit 'Structured & Disciplined' is applicable as HIIT workouts often involve methodical interval structures and progression. The structured format of 30 and 60-second intervals suggests technical precision and a disciplined approach to rowing, which warrants a score of 0.7 for this spirit. While the session is intense, the presence of a methodical training component suggests some degree of discipline involved."
