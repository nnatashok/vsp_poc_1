  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout focuses on 'Post-Row Recovery,' which immediately suggests a restorative session aimed at recovery and relaxation. The description emphasizes 'stretching and mobility,' targeting areas like hips, hamstrings, glutes, and adductors, further reinforcing a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a high confidence score of 0.9. The optional use of a long resistance band suggests gentle assistance rather than high-intensity exercise. The category 'On The Mat' and 'mobility' underline a focus on calm, restorative movements.\n\nAdditionally, the image shows the workout being conducted outdoors by the water, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Although primarily recovery-focused, the outdoor setting provides an element of adventure, justifying a secondary spirit with a moderate score of 0.7. The playlist's indie and alternative music genres might enhance a relaxed atmosphere but do not significantly alter the primary restorative focus."
