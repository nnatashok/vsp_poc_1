  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' in the Hydrow platform typically implies a higher technique difficulty, but given the focus on rowing, the technique levels are likely Beginner to Intermediate. The use of terms like 'climb' and the presence of Olympians suggests a more sophisticated rowing experience, aligning with complex rowing techniques often associated with intermediate skills. However, both levels are plausible for general rowing workouts, thus scores are Beginner (0.7) and Intermediate (0.8) with high confidence due to mixed signals and hydrow specifics. User fitness level of Advanced suggests greater complexity but does not preclude the typical Intermediate technique seen in 'row' Instructors.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is marked with the highest intensity level (3 out of 3). The presence of Olympian instructors and a 'drive' format with a max rhythm of 30 suggests a high-energy, possibly interval-intensive row, typically very demanding. The duration, just over 20 minutes, focuses on high density rather than extended endurance, likely contributing to a Challenging to Extreme effort demand. Hence, the scores are Challenging (0.8) and Extreme (0.6) with high confidence, especially given the historical performance context and workout intensity settings.",
