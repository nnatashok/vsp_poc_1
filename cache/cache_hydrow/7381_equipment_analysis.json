  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is labeled with the 'row' category, which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. The metadata mentions 'reinforce proper sequencing with Mike in this reflective cool-down,' indicating that correct rowing technique is being focused on, further suggesting the presence of a rowing machine. The mention of 'cool down' suggests a low-intensity session, typically performed after rowing, corroborating the need for a rowing machine. Although no specific equipment is listed, the categorization and context provide a high confidence level for a rowing machine being required."
