  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's spirit is predominantly \"Outdoor & Adventure\" due to several compelling indicators in the metadata, such as the title \"Newport Harbor Bow View\" and the description which invites participants to \"Explore the shores of Newport Beach, California from the water.\" This suggests a visual rowing experience likely recorded outdoors, emphasizing exploration and the natural environment, consistent with the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. Moreover, the categorization under 'Journeys' reinforces the adventure and exploration theme typical of outdoor-oriented sessions. The lack of intense or structured terminologies in the metadata indicates that spirits such as High-Energy & Intense or Structured & Disciplined are not applicable. Despite the absence of details such as music genre, the environmental focus provides high confidence (0.85) in this classification."
