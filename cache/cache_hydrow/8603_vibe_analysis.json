  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is described primarily as a 'cool-down,' emphasizing gentle stretching and steady rowing, which aligns perfectly with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, aimed at refreshing and releasing tension. The indie and global hits music suggests a soothing yet engaging backdrop, enhancing the refreshment aspect, hence a strong score of 0.8.\n\nThe element of gentle stretching and intentional movements also resonates with 'The Zen Flow,' which centers on grounding and breath-centric exercises. The description mentions a slow rhythm and calming strokes, warranting a moderate score of 0.6 for this vibe.\n\nFinally, the 'Meditative Grind' is selected due to the steady format and rowing focus. While it's less intense and more relaxation-oriented, the repetitive nature of the strokes aligns with this vibe and supports a moderate 0.6 score. Both scores are derived from the combination of steady rowing and calming audio, providing an immersive, gentle, and mentally restorative experience."
