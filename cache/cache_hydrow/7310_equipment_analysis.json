  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Post-Row Align\" and aims to open areas that hold tension following a rowing session. The category is \"On The Mat,\" which strongly suggests the use of a mat for floor-based exercises. The provided image also shows individuals sitting on mats, confirming their use in this workout. Although the workout type is 'align' and may involve stretching or yoga-like movements, there is no indication of other equipment being necessary. Thus, a mat is very likely a central piece of equipment, earning a high confidence score of 0.8."
