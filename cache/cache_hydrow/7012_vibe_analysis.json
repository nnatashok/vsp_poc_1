  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Meditative Grind' is chosen due to the steady nature of the row, as indicated by the metadata, including 'Steadily row' and the format described as 'Steady'. This suggests a rhythmic and repetitive session typical of meditative workouts, supported by a low intensity level of 1 out of 3 and a duration allowing for a moderate endurance session. The choice of Indie Alternative and Global Hits music genres suggests a more reflective and engaging auditory environment. 'The Endorphin Wave' is considered due to the steady build in the rowing session and the uplifting music, but it is secondary as the workout is low in intensity. This analysis reflects a moderate to high confidence level based on the explicit 'breathe' category and overall tone, which excludes more intense or competitive vibes."
