  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which mandates the inclusion of a 'Rowing machine' as per the analysis guidelines. The precise title 'Glacier View Cool-Down' and description indicates participants are to 'glide towards the Fox Glacier', suggesting rowing movements. The format 'steady' and max rhythm of 20 also align with rowing metrics, reinforcing the requirement of a rowing machine. Given the category and various elements connected to rowing activities, such as the steady pace and cool-down context, the confidence level is very high that a rowing machine is central to this workout."
