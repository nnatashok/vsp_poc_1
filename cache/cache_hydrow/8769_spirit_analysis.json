  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout has a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the rowing being done on a river with a backdrop of Tampa, suggesting a natural and exploratory setting. This is supported by the visual evidence provided in the image.\n\nThe high-intensity level (2 out of 3) and the interval format, along with the title 'Tampa Intervals Row' and the 'sweat' category, suggest a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. This spirit is further reinforced by the playlist, which includes rock and mid-intensity global hits, promoting a vigorous workout atmosphere.\n\nFinally, there are moderate elements of a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit given the reference to rhythm in the description ('Max rhythm: 30') and the continuous nature of rowing. However, this is less dominant compared to the other spirits."
