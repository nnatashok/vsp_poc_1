  "vibesExplanation": "The workout has a clear focus on cooling down, which aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, designed for total-body refreshment. This is strongly supported by the title 'Steady Cool-Down' and the description emphasizing a steady approach along a scenic river route, leading to a high score of 0.8.\n\nMeanwhile, rowing alongside the Charles River suggests a connection with nature, fitting 'The Nature Flow' vibe. The description's mention of the river setting provides evidence for this vibe, warranting a score of 0.6.\n\nLastly, the repetitive, steady nature of a cool-down rowing session could fit 'The Meditative Grind.' This is characterized by zoning in and letting repetition take over, though the emphasis on cool-down reduces the intensity of this vibe, leading to a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nOverall, the workout's calming and steady characteristics align well with these vibes, considering the setting and music choices, particularly the peaceful and reflective tone of songs by Maggie Rogers."
