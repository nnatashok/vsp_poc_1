  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Climbing Cardio Row', explicitly suggests the use of rowing equipment through its title and description mentioning 'strokes per minute'. The category includes 'row', indicating that a rowing machine is central to the workout. The absence of other equipment mentions further supports the singular focus on indoor rowing, resulting in a very high confidence score of 1 for the rowing machine."
