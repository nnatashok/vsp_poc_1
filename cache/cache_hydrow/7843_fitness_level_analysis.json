  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This rowing workout falls under the 'row' category, which according to Hydrow-specific rules can only be classified at a Beginner or Intermediate technique level. The description suggests maintaining a consistent split, which is achievable for beginners with some guidance. The presence of intervals indicates slight complexity, but not beyond Beginner level, especially considering it's aimed at beginners. Hence, a 0.8 score for Beginner is appropriate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is moderately long at 21:21 minutes, and the pace requires maintaining a consistent rhythm. Given the intensity level is 1 out of 3, which points to a lower exertion rate, this is suitable for beginners and potentially deconditioned users. The interval nature adds slight effort complexity, but overall, aligns more with Light exertion. Moderate effort difficulty accounts for the possibility of some users finding interval work more taxing.",
