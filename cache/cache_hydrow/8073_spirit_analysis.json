  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Power + Quickness Warm-Up' in Bergen clearly fits the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the visible rowing on a river, which aligns with leveraging natural terrain. This is substantiated by the image showing the workout taking place outdoors. The phrase 'raising your rhythm and power' implies a focus on rhythm, supported by pop music genres in the playlist that could drive a rhythmic pace, indicative of 'Flow & Rhythm.' Though the session is a warm-up, there is an emphasis on raising power, which somewhat aligns with a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit but not strongly enough due to the warm-up nature limiting intensity. The music selection from artists like The Roots and The Fugees further supports a rhythmic focus. The spirits 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded as there is no emphasis on strict protocols or relaxation."
