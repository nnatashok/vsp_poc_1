  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Steady + Stretching Cool-Down,' suggests a calming and relaxing vibe, appropriate for activities like stretching and rowing at a steady pace. The use of the phrase 'cool down' and the inclusion of gentle music genres like Indie Alternative and Global Hits imply a focus on winding down and recovery. \n\nThe vibe 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.7 is chosen due to the steady rowing element, which aligns with a repetitive and focused practice, allowing for zoning in. \n\n'The Reboot Workout' (score 0.6) is included due to the cool-down nature, emphasizing stretching and relaxation to refresh the body.\n\n'The Zen Flow' (score 0.5) is considered because of the calming music and gentle stretching, indicating a breath-centered and grounding experience.\n\nConfidence in these choices is high due to clear indicators of a low-intensity, meditative session focused on relaxation and recovery after a workout."
