  "spiritsExplanation": "The title 'Stretch + Steady Cool-Down' and the description emphasize gentle stretching and cooling down, which aligns closely with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. Keywords like 'gently stretch' and 'cool your body down' strongly indicate a focus on relaxation and recovery, scoring a 0.9 in this category. The workout type and category both indicate a cool down, further supporting this classification.\n\nThe visual context shows rowing on a river, which falls under the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the natural setting. Although the primary focus is not adventure, the outdoor environment is a significant component, leading to a score of 0.7 in this category.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit could be considered, given the gentle strokes and music-driven context, but is less emphasized compared to the soothing and restorative aspects. Therefore, it was not included in the final classification."
