  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Post-Row Pilates,' suggests it is a Pilates session meant as a cool-down or supplemental activity following rowing. The category 'On The Mat' and 'pilates' strongly indicate that a mat is necessary equipment. The image confirms this expectation by showing individuals using mats, aligning with typical Pilates practice which involves floor exercises that require a mat for comfort and stability. Therefore, based on the description and imagery, the confidence that a mat is needed is very high at 0.9."
