  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout named 'Rest Focused Cool-Down' with a description emphasizing 'intentional rest' while rowing signals a strong alignment with the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The steady format, along with a max rhythm of 20, which is relatively slow, further supports this classification, leading to a high score of 0.9 for its focus on recovery and relaxation.\n\nThe playlist includes tracks like 'Wonder' by Shawn Mendes and 'Breathe (Taylor\u2019s Version)' which suggests a gentle and calming rhythm conducive to a Flow & Rhythm spirit, although the primary focus remains on rest, so it receives a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nThe image, showing rowing on a river, suggests an element of Outdoor & Adventure, relevant to outdoor water-based activities where surrounding nature plays a part, thus it's given a score of 0.4 although its focus is secondary to the rest-oriented theme."
