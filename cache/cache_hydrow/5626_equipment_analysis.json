  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata and image strongly indicate that a rowing machine is required for this workout. The workout name \"Bootcamp HIIT Row\" and description \"as you row in Oklahoma City\" explicitly mention rowing. The category includes 'row', which suggests rowing equipment is central. The format is HIIT, suggesting structured intervals on the rowing machine. The reference to 'drive' and 'max rhythm' supports high-intensity use, typical for rowing machines. Therefore, there's very high confidence that a rowing machine is needed."
