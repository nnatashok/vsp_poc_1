  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Bodyweight Strength', indicating no external weights are needed. The description mentions a bodyweight session targeting legs and abs and the category 'On The Mat' strongly suggests exercises performed on the floor, such as planks or push-ups, which usually require a mat for comfort and support. The image also shows the individual standing on a mat, confirming its use. Hence, a mat is identified as necessary with high confidence (0.8)."
