  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is labeled as a 'cool-down,' indicating a focus on lowering heart rate and recovering from more intense activities. The term 'reverse climb' and the mention of music genres like 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' suggest an element of rhythm and a smooth, gradual deceleration, matching well with 'The Reboot Workout,' which centers on low-stress, total-body refreshment.\n\nThe playlist includes artists known for their uplifting and smooth tracks, supporting an 'Endorphin Wave' vibe characterized by steady, feel-good movement and energy.\n\nThere is no explicit focus on technique or high-intensity, minimizing the relevance of vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.' Confidence in these vibes stems from the relaxed nature of a cool-down and accompanying music."
