  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Solid Technique Row' is strongly aligned with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit due to the emphasis on 'perfect form' and the 'technique-oriented' nature of the session. The interval format and low intensity also suggest a focus on discipline and methodical training. This spirit is scored high at 0.9.\n\nThe presence of outdoor rowing, as indicated by the image and river setting, supports an 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification, although the primary focus is technique. Hence, this spirit is moderately integrated and receives a score of 0.7.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is additionally relevant, with music like Hip Hop/R&B Mid and Global Hits providing a rhythmic background. Yet, it's a secondary aspect compared to technique, scoring it 0.5.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Soothing & Restorative', and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the focus on form over intensity or recovery."
