  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive', which on the Hydrow platform generally equates to an advanced rowing experience. However, since the workout is rowing-based, the technique difficulty is capped at Intermediate at most. The inclusion of the term 'chasing low splits' suggests a focus on maintaining form under increasing intensity, but it is still relatively manageable for those newer to rowing, making Beginner and Intermediate classifications both applicable, albeit with more weight on Beginner due to simpler rowing mechanics.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Effort difficulty is marked as high due to a format of HIIT and a maximum rhythm of 30, indicating intense bursts that are physically demanding. The workout duration of nearly 12 minutes with maximized intensity level (3 out of 3) suggests a substantial energy output. 'Drive' workouts typically require a significant effort, aligning with Challenging and Extreme categories, though the shorter duration moderates the Extreme score slightly, hence a stronger alignment with Challenging.",
