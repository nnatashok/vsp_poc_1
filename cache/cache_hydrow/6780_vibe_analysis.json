  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of this workout is 'The Firestarter' due to the HIIT format with interval training of 60, 45, and 30 seconds, indicating short, explosive, and intense efforts. The intensity level of 3 out of 3 further supports this, leading to a high score of 0.9. \n\n'\"The Meditative Grind\"' is also a suitable vibe as rowing is inherently repetitive and endurance-focused, which aligns with the meditative aspect of the workout despite the shorter duration. This gives it a moderate score of 0.6.\n\n'The Nightclub Workout' can be considered due to the upbeat music genres such as Dance high and Global Hits, along with tracks from artists like Kygo and Alexis Jordan, which suggests an energizing and rhythm-infused experience. However, since the workout does not focus on dance or music-driven movements, it receives a lower score of 0.5.\n\nOverall, the data provides good clarity on the energetic nature of the workout, with some support for meditative and music-driven elements, leading to a high confidence level of 0.85."
