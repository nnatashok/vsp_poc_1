  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Burn Express Pilates' primarily aligns with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe due to its focus on technique and skill-building. The use of Pilates, a form that emphasizes precision and core strength, supports this classification. The description mentions 'ignite your core' and a series of exercises, indicating a structured approach. The short duration of under six minutes suggests an emphasis on quality and efficiency over intense calorie burn, which is typical for a Masterclass.\n\nThe music genre 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' adds a calming layer, suggesting some meditative qualities as users engage in focused movements on the mat. This aligns moderately with 'The Meditative Grind' due to the repetitive and structured nature of Pilates. However, 'Rhythmic Powerhouse' and other high-intensity vibes were excluded as the workout's calm music and Pilates focus do not match explosive energy or intense rhythms.\n\nConfidence is moderately high (0.75) given the clarity of the metadata, but lack of music detail reduces full certainty."
