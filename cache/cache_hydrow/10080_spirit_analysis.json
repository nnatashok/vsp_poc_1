  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'One Stroke at a Time Row' has a moderate confidence level concerning its classification. The focus on 'being present' and 'tackle your workout just one stroke at a time' suggests a mindful and controlled approach, aligning with 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits. The max rhythm of 22 and the description of 'breathe' emphasize a calming, methodical pace, which supports a 0.7 score for 'Flow & Rhythm' and a 0.6 for 'Soothing & Restorative'. \n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is evidenced by the 'Variable' format of the workout, suggesting planned variations, which justifies a 0.5 score. \n\nThe 'Sport & Agility' spirit was considered due to Mac's background as a former collegiate rower, but the workout's intensity level (1 out of 3) and focus on beginners do not strongly support it. Similarly, 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are not applicable due to the absence of indicators for high energy levels or outdoor settings."
