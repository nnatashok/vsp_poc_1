  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's category includes 'row,' which strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine. The high confidence score of 0.9 reflects this categorization. Additionally, the reference to the 'Vltava River Stern View' and 'Take in the historic sites of downtown Prague along the Vltava River' suggests a simulated rowing experience, which is typically done using a rowing machine to mimic rowing on a river. No other equipment is indicated in the metadata, and there are no keywords suggesting additional equipment requirements. Therefore, the primary and likely sole piece of equipment needed is a rowing machine, central to the workout experience described."
