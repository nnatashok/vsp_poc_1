  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' is strongly represented in this session due to the focus on a 'power flow,' which indicates smooth, continuous movement patterns that align with musical rhythm. The description suggests building heat through flow, reinforcing the mind-body connection typical in such exercises. The use of music from 'Chill mid' and 'Cool/Downtempo' genres further supports the rhythmic, coordinated nature of the session, which merits a score of 0.8 for this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is an important aspect of the workout as it is performed in a natural outdoor environment, as seen in the accompanying image and the description mentioning views over Pete's hometown. This setting leverages the environment and landscape, making it a relevant choice with a score of 0.7. The absence of intense or highly structured language in the metadata reduces the likelihood of other spirits being dominant."
