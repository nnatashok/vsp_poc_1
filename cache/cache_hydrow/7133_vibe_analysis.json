  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Heat Building Yoga Align' session is characterized by the phrase 'move with your breath through sun salutation,' suggesting a grounding and breath-centered workout. This aligns well with 'The Zen Flow' vibe due to the intentional, breath-focused nature of yoga, particularly sun salutations, which embodies a sense of serenity and mindfulness with a score of 0.8.\n\nThe playlist includes tracks like 'Heat Waves' and 'Rojo,' which are chill/downtempo, supporting a meditative or relaxed state, but also introducing an element of rhythm. This contributes to a secondary vibe of 'The Groove Session,' highlighting fun, fluid movement, reflected in a score of 0.6.\n\nThe lack of explicit intensity markers or competitive elements helps exclude vibes like 'The Competitor' or 'The Warrior Workout.' The setting in Seville, Spain, and the lack of intense equipment or duration markers suggest a calm, harmonious session, reinforcing the selected vibes."
