  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as \"High-Energy & Intense\" due to several strong indicators: the use of the phrase \"max effort,\" the description of rowing at a maximum rhythm of 38+ strokes per minute, and a 3 out of 3 intensity level suggest a very vigorous session. Additionally, the song \"Kick Out The Epic Motherf**ker\" by Dada Life, along with radio stations like Dance High and Global Hits, implies a high-energy environment suitable for intense exertion. This classification is given a strong score of 0.9, reflecting clear alignment.\n\nThe presence of rowing in a natural water setting, as seen in the image, supports the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. This context is further supported by the \"Drive\" and \"standard row\" categories, suggesting a typical rowing experience enhanced by the adventure of outdoor settings. This spirit is assigned 0.7, due to the significant outdoor element shown, even though the workout seems more focused on intensity than exploration."
