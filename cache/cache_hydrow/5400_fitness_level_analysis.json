Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the short duration of 11:13, the effort difficulty leans towards the lower end. The fast-paced flow is aimed at building heat which does suggest a moderate energy expenditure for this short duration, common in gentle yoga practices. It is designed as a warm-up, indicating a less intense nature, but the pace increases physical demand slightly above simple relaxing poses, hence both 'Light' and 'Moderate' are appropriate.",
