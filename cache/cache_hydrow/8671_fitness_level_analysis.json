  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive', which according to Hydrow's specific rules, aligns with an 'Intermediate' technique difficulty for row-based workouts. This is due to the focused attention on maintaining proper form during a 'Drive' session, which requires a moderate level of coordination and body awareness, but it does not reach 'Advanced' due to being a rowing-focused exercise. The technique difficulty score reflects a strong alignment with this level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is marked with an intensity level of 3 out of 3 and described as a 'Power' format, indicating a high level of energy expenditure. Additionally, the session is approximately 11 minutes long with a high rhythm of 32, suggesting a continuous high effort. The effort required is challenging, especially for less fit users, but the duration is not long enough to classify it as 'Extreme' for users at a low motivation level. Thus, while intense, it remains in the 'Challenging' category, demonstrating a strong alignment with this level.",
