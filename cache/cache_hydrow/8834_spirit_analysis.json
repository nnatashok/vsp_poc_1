  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Big Climb Row' heavily emphasizes rhythm and effort in its description, particularly with the phrase 'climb in rhythm and effort,' indicating a focus on maintaining a pace and smooth coordination, which aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The max rhythm of 26 and the listening to pop low and global hits further support this classification, suggesting a music-driven pace. The inclusion of Aisyah's insights, her compassionate approach, and the classification under 'breathe' with a beginner intensity level of 1 out of 3 indicate the workout's relaxing and rejuvenating nature, supporting a secondary classification as 'Soothing & Restorative.' However, the moderate confidence level reflects a lack of explicit mention of recovery elements. The presence of an Olympic rower as an instructor, despite being a potential indicator of 'Sport & Agility,' is not heavily leaned on due to the beginner focus and the specific format described."
