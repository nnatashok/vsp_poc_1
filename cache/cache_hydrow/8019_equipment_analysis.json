  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and is an interval-based warm-up titled 'Spicy Warm-Up', which includes taking a 'five stroke sprint'. This strongly indicates the use of a Rowing machine, as 'strokes' are specifically related to rowing activities. The image also depicts an individual rowing, likely in an outdoor setting, but for indoor workouts, this implies the use of a rowing machine. Hence, the confidence is very high at 0.9 that a rowing machine is required."
