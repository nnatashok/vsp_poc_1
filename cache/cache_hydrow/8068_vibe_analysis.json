  "vibesExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies 'The Disciplined Grind' vibe due to its focus on building lower body strength, indicating a no-excuses, execution-focused workout. This is supported by the standard, on-the-mat nature without any additional equipment, emphasizing method and repetition over extras. The 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe is also appropriate, given the music selection from Dance mid, Global Hits, and artists like Dillon Francis and DJ Snake, which infuse an energetic beat-driven ambiance that complements strength exercises. Lastly, 'The Explorer's Workout' is suggested by the scenic outdoor setting in Ulvik, Norway, though its lower score reflects this being a scenic influence rather than a core workout aspect. The confidence level is high due to strong indications from the music and workout description, despite the lack of specified music genre or instructor guidance."
