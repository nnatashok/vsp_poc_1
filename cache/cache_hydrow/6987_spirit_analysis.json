  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout boasts a strong High-Energy & Intense spirit, indicated by phrases such as 'Build power,' 'max pace,' and '30\" blasters,' along with the highest intensity level of 3 out of 3. The music playlist featuring upbeat tracks like 'Blinding Lights' and 'Levitating' underscores a fast-paced, energetic workout environment, supporting a score of 0.85 for this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the rowing session portrayed in the image suggests an Outdoor & Adventure spirit. The setting on the water and visible surroundings imply an outdoor rowing experience, justifying a 0.7 score for this category.\n\nThe interval format and drive nature of the workout suggest a structured approach, but the dominant elements revolve around intensity and outdoor setting. Therefore, Structured & Disciplined was considered but not deemed as significant, with a possible influence noted in the second and third choices."
