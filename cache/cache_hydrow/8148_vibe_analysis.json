The duration is relatively short (10 minutes), aligning with quick recovery sessions typical of 'The Reboot Workout.'\n\nThe description mentions 'rolling of the glutes, quads, and back,' indicating a focus on muscle release and relaxation. While the specific music genre is not detailed, the radio stations played ('Indie Alternative, Global Hits') and playlist songs such as 'Younger (Kygo Remix)' suggest a relaxed, soothing atmosphere, which suits a recovery-focused vibe.\n\n'Zen Flow' is considered due to the breath-centered, intentional, and unhurried nature of foam rolling. The lack of any high intensity or competitive elements further supports this vibe. This analysis leads to a high confidence level in classifying this workout mainly as 'The Reboot Workout' with a secondary influence of 'The Zen Flow.'"
