  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout falls under the rowing category ('row'), which typically aligns with Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty, per Hydrow-specific rules. Given the 'sweat' type and the focus on maintaining a rhythm of 26, there is an element of coordination involved, aligning it moderately with Intermediate. However, the general simplicity and typical nature of rowing movements keep the technique accessible enough for most beginners, resulting in a stronger alignment with Beginner.",
