  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' and 'row' category typically suggests a rowing session where the primary technique difficulty can range from Beginner to Intermediate. Given the 'Power' format and high rhythm (30+), the session likely involves maintaining a challenging pace, requiring some coordination and form integrity, which aligns well with 'Intermediate'. The metadata does not indicate any overly complex movements beyond rowing.",
