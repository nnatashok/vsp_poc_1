  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.9. This aligns with the 'flow' nature of the workout, emphasized by both the name 'Welcome to LA Power Flow' and the description indicating an energizing and movement-focused session. The music also complements this spirit, with tracks and radio stations described as 'Chill mid' and 'Cool/Downtempo,' supporting a rhythmic, flow-based workout.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is relevant, scored at 0.8, due to the setting at Mother's Beach in Marina del Rey. The outdoor scene is a significant aspect, as indicated by the imagery of the beach environment. This highlights nature's role in the workout, making it an integral part of the session's energy and experience.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were considered but deemed less fitting due to the indicated flow nature and the energetic but not overly intense pace suggested by the music and environment."
