  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Human Body Facts Row' has several cues indicating a mix of 'The Endorphin Wave' and 'The Meditative Grind'. The presence of high-energy music tracks like 'Here For You' and 'Sinnerman (Sofi Tukker Remix)', along with the 'Dance mid, Global Hits' radio stations, suggest an elevated energy level, which aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, scoring a 0.75.\n\nThe workout also features intervals, described as a shift in effort levels, which typically involves repetitive movements aligning with 'The Meditative Grind', scoring 0.6. This is further supported by the row-based format, emphasizing consistency and endurance. \n\nThe duration of 16 minutes and the described medium intensity at level 2 out of 3 enhances the repetitive and endurance aspects rather than high intensity or explosive power, excluding vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter'. \n\nOverall, the combination of rhythmic music and interval rowing creates a balanced vibe between endorphin-boosting energy and meditative focus."
