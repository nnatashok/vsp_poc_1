  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The Technique Difficulty is classified as Intermediate due to the nature of the workout. The workout is a 'Drive' type which, according to Hydrow-specific rules, denotes more advanced rowing techniques requiring coordination and control. Though 'row' only allows a Beginner or Intermediate classification, the inclusion of varying sprint formats within the session slightly elevates the complexity. This justifies a strong Intermediate classification as there is a clear emphasis on control and rhythm changes.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The Effort Difficulty is judged to be Challenging. The sprint nature of the workout, utilizing intervals of 2', 1', and 30\u201d suggests high intensity, especially highlighted by the maximum rhythm reaching 34 strokes per minute. The overall duration is relatively short, at just over 21 minutes, but the intensity level is marked 3 out of 3. This signals strong energy expenditure within the brief time frame and aligns with the indicators of significant effort. The duration, combined with high-intensity sprints and minimal rest, supports a Challenging classification for those less physically conditioned.",
