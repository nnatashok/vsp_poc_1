Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "As a 15-minute journey rowing workout, this suggests a Light to Moderate effort. The 'journey' type with no mention of intensity cues implies a more leisurely, exploratory session rather than high-intensity. Therefore, the energy expenditure is low to medium, catering to less-fit users and suporting a higher score for Light effort difficulty.",
