  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' suggests technique difficulty in the Intermediate range, as per Hydrow-specific rules. Rowing generally aligns with Beginner to Intermediate levels due to its rhythmic and repetitive nature, requiring some coordination. However, the 'drive' classification, often associated with powerful rowing, suggests techniques requiring more precise and coordinated strokes, supporting the Intermediate level classification. The Beginner score is slightly lower due to the additional challenge from the 'drive' focus.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is formatted as HIIT with a 'drive' classification, lasting 11:21 minutes and involving 15-second intense intervals, which indicates a workout demanding significant energy expenditure. The high rhythm (max 34) and the highest workout intensity level (3 out of 3) reinforce the classification of this workout as Challenging in terms of effort. The duration, interval nature requiring high energy output, and recovery can be demanding for less fit users, substantiating the Challenging classification.",
