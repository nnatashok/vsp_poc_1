  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' with a score of 0.75. The metadata indicates a 'power yoga flow' which suggests a strong, beat-driven exercise. The playlist features remix tracks with a cool and downtempo feel, supporting a music-infused yet energetic session. \n\n'The Groove Session' receives a score of 0.6. The description mentions a 'faster-paced flow,' which implies a fun, expressive vibe aligned with danceable, rhythmic movements. The playlist's inclusion of artists like Kygo and Years & Years contributes to this vibe.\n\n'The Zen Flow' is also a match with a score of 0.55, as the yoga element and term 'flow' suggest a grounding, intentional practice. However, the faster pace and music selection shift it slightly away from a purely calming experience.\n\nThe use of blocks indicates accessibility and adaptation for different levels, emphasizing flow and rhythm over static postures. The lack of a specified instructor may reduce the precision or technical focus, aligning more with flow-based vibes."
