  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout exhibits a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to the focus on sprint pace and maximum effort finishes, paired with an intensity level of 3 out of 3. This is reinforced by the rock music playlist, featuring tracks known for boosting energy, and terms like 'max effort' and 'sprint pace,' justifying a score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is evident from the image showing the workout taking place on a river, aligning with the classification for rowing sessions recorded in natural settings, garnering a score of 0.8.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is reflected in the interval format and progressive week-based race schedule (Week 3 of 4), indicating a planned and methodical approach, supporting a score of 0.7.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' don't fit due to the workout's high intensity and structured format. Overall, the metadata strongly indicates a high-energy, structured outdoor training session."
