Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is short at 10 minutes, indicating a lower energy expenditure. The focus on mobility suggests a lighter intensity aimed at recovery and flexibility rather than weight loss or strength building, hence aligning with a Light effort difficulty. However, given the instructor's background in intensive sports, there might be a slight push towards more active engagement during the session, indicating a potential Moderate effort requirement for some phases, thus the mix of Light and Moderate scores.",
