  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 5 minutes and 37 seconds in a 'warm-up' format, which inherently indicates a lower effort demand, aligning strongly with the 'Light' category. The max rhythm of 26 signifies a quicker pace, meriting a secondary consideration for 'Moderate', but overall exertion remains low due to the short duration and implied nature of a warm-up.",
