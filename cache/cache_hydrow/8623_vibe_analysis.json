  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is a short, mat pilates session focusing on core exercises, which aligns with elements of 'The Meditative Grind' due to the repetitive, focused nature of pilates. The high-energy songs 'Wake Me Up' and 'Magnets (A-Trak Remix)' suggest a steady build-up of energy and rhythm, aligning partially with 'The Endorphin Wave' as they enhance a feel-good atmosphere. The choice of dance and global hits music and the rhythmic nature of pilates exercises suggest 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, but to a lesser extent. The absence of equipment and the mat-based format exclude more extreme or intense vibes, focusing instead on controlled, rhythm-oriented movement."
