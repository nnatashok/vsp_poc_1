This is supported by the radio stations played, which typically feature engaging and steady beats. The secondary spirit is 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.6, indicated by instructor Mike Dostal's background, which emphasizes technique and dedication, suggesting a methodical approach. The workout is categorized under 'breathe' and 'standard', which suggests routine and structure. Lastly, 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.5, is suggested by the low intensity (1 out of 3) and the inclusion of categories like 'breathe'. The workout's low intensity and mention of 'reflect on funny Valentines Day stories' imply a relaxing and restorative atmosphere, making it fit this spirit partially. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to the nature and environment of the session."
