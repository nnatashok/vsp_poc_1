Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is very short (5:38 minutes), and given that it is a mobility session, the physical demand is low, suitable for light effort. The lack of equipment and the purpose to 'open up' the shoulders suggest low energy expenditure. The overall confidence is high in classifying this as Light effort, with a slight potential for moderate effort due to targeted muscle engagement.",
