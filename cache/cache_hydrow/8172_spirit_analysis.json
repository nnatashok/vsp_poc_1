  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout takes place on the shores of Bergen, which clearly suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The use of a natural setting, such as a river, supports this classification strongly, warranting a score of 1.0. Additionally, the workout's format is described as 'breathe', with a focus on rowing to music, such as pop hits that typically offer a rhythmic flow. This suggests a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, as the session likely emphasizes coordination and enjoying the scenery, meriting a score of 0.7. The workout's low intensity level of 1 out of 3 also implies a calming, less strenuous session, hinting at a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, so a score of 0.5 is appropriate. The structured climb format suggests some structure, but it leans more towards rhythm and flow due to the low intensity and scenic environment. Other spirits were excluded due to lack of intensity and sports-specific training elements."
