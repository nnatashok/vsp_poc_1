  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled 'Racing Rock Row' includes rowing-specific language, such as 'high rhythm numbers' and 'intervals,' which are indicative of rowing exercises. Additionally, the categories include 'row' and 'standard,' which typically involve a rowing machine. The high confidence score is supported by these explicit mentions and the general theme of the workout. Furthermore, the image provided shows an individual on a rowing machine, reinforcing the necessity of this equipment. Therefore, a rowing machine is clearly central to the workout with a very high confidence level of 1.0."
