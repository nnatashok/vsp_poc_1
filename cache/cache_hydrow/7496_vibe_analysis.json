  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized by high intensity intervals (HIIT) with '1-minute high intensity intervals' mentioned in the description, which aligns strongly with 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its focus on fast, explosive effort. The combination of high intensity level (3 out of 3) and a short duration (21 minutes) supports this classification, giving it a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe inclusion of a max rhythm of 28 suggests a heart-racing experience, aligning with 'The Adrenaline Rush'. This vibe is supported by the challenge presented, albeit in a contained format, earning it a score of 0.75.\n\nThe playlist includes energetic pop songs such as 'Titanium' and 'Confident,' which suggest a vibrant, party-like energy typically found in 'The Nightclub Workout'. Given the high tempo and global hits used, this slightly aligns with this vibe, but since the focus is on sprint-like efforts, the fit is less direct, scoring 0.7.\n\nOverall, indicators strongly support a blend of explosive intensity and rhythmic energy, with clear emphasis on high speed and maximum engagement."
