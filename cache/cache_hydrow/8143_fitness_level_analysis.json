  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'beginner-friendly' and involves bodyweight exercises, which typically suggest simple movements. However, the involvement of an Olympian as an instructor and the focus on full body strength may introduce slightly more complex bodyweight exercises that require some coordination, hence the consideration for Intermediate. The absence of equipment further reinforces simplicity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short at 15:43 minutes, which supports a Light effort classification. However, since it aims at strengthening the lower body, core, and upper body even without equipment, it suggests a low-to-medium energy expenditure requiring moderate effort from deconditioned users, bumping it slightly into the 'Moderate' category too.",
