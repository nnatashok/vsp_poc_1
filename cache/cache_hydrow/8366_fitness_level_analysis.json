  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' and category 'row' typically require a high degree of power output and precision. However, based on Hydrow-specific categories, a 'row' technique can only be rated up to 'Intermediate'. Thus, while the movements may have elements of complexity due to the drive component, they are still classified as Intermediate. The user fitness requirement of 'Advanced' suggests complexity, but the established rule for rowing workouts limits technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 11:18 minutes with a high rhythm of 34 and a workout intensity rated 3 out of 3 suggests a very physically demanding session. The focus on 'accumulating maximum meters' implies significant exertion and high energy output. For less fit users, this aligns with near 'Extreme' effort, but since it's on the shorter side, 'Challenging' remains the more appropriate classification.",
