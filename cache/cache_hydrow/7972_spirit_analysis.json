  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Sibling Power Row' is classified as having a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to its interval structure with 30-second, 60-second, and 2-minute bursts, and the highest intensity level (3 out of 3), suggesting a focus on pushing limits and exertion. The use of high-energy indie alternative and global hits music supports this dynamic. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is relevant given the emphasis on varying rhythms, indicating smooth transitions and a need for coordination, driven by music. The playlist includes rhythmic songs that may foster this flow. The 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is significantly present as the image reveals a river setting, aligning with nature-based exploration, enhancing the adventurous aspect of the session. Confidence is high based on the explicit emphasis on energy, rhythm, and the outdoor visual context."
