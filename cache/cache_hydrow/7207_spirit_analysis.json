  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Speed Splits Row' clearly demonstrates the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, which is supported by multiple metadata indicators: 'attack high intensity intervals,' 'format: HIIT,' and 'workout intensity level: 3 out of 3.' These elements strongly suggest a focus on fast-paced, vigorous effort, fitting this spirit well (score: 0.9).\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is evident from the rowing session taking place on water, as seen in the image. Rowing on a river or open water inherently involves environmental challenges and exploration, aligning well with this category (score: 0.8).\n\nThe playlist, featuring songs by Ed Sheeran and others, supports an upbeat, energetic atmosphere but does not solely define the spirit. Other spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are less relevant here due to the lack of emphasis on smooth continuous movement or strictly progressive training protocols."
