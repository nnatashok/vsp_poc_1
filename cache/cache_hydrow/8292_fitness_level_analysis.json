  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'Drive' category for rowing, which typically suggests a more advanced technique. However, the nature of the workout involves rowing, which inherently limits the upper bound of technique difficulty to 'Intermediate'. The presence of one-minute intervals introduced a slight complexity, indicating a strong alignment with Intermediate (score 0.7) but also reflecting that there is still simplicity worthy of Beginner alignment (score 0.3).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's HIIT format and intensity level at 3 out of 3 indicate that the session is significantly demanding. The duration of 11 minutes of rowing with high rhythm implies a challenging effort difficulty. A score of 0.6 reflects this challenge, particularly for less fit users, while a score of 0.4 recognizes that brief duration might not reach extreme levels for all participants.",
