  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is called \"Staying Cool Row,\" which suggests a focus on maintaining a consistent pace. The description highlights an interval format, fitting \"The Meditative Grind\" vibe, as rowing with consistent pacing resonates with repetition and endurance. The max rhythm of 26 also supports this. The music playlist includes pop songs that are rhythm-driven, such as 'Cool For The Summer', aligning with \"The Rhythmic Powerhouse.\" The low intensity level (1 out of 3) and the \"breathe\" type suggest a relaxed, meditative experience, reinforcing the choice of \"The Meditative Grind.\" Despite the upbeat music, the focus remains on maintaining steady performance, rather than high energy or explosive movement. The vibe confidence is moderate to high due to clear indicators in the format and description, but music genre ambiguity leaves room for alternate vibe interpretation."
