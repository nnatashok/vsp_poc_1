  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Leg Drive Warm-Up' is associated with the 'row' category, indicating that it is designed for rowing preparation. The description explicitly mentions 'prepare for your row,' strongly suggesting the use of rowing equipment. Given these specifics and the category type 'row,' there is very high confidence (1.0) that a rowing machine is required for this warm-up session."
