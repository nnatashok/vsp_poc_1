Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is brief, lasting only 5 minutes and 45 seconds, with a max rhythm set at 24, typically associated with cool-downs. This indicates a low-energy expenditure suitable for Light effort. The possibility of Moderate effort is considered due to technique refinement, which may require some extra focus. Thus, 'Light' and 'Moderate' effort levels are possible interpretations.",
