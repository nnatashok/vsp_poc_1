Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as a 'Cool Down' with a short duration of 5 minutes and 54 seconds, suggesting very low energy expenditure. The purpose of the session is to calm and reflect, as described in the metadata, which implies a focus on gentle, restorative movements rather than high-effort activity. The steady format and max rhythm of 24 further support this, as both uphold a relaxed pace. Consequently, the effort difficulty correctly aligns with 'Light,' appropriate for cool down activities typically designed to aid in recovery.",
