  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Steady State Row' with a focus on a steady rhythm of 22, described as a \"breathe\" workout, strongly suggests the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The emphasis on endurance and maintaining a consistent pace aligns with smooth, continuous movement. The use of 'breathe' in the workout type and category further reinforces this spirit. Based on these indicators, a score of 0.75 is assigned.\n\nThe image and context of rowing on a river fit the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This classification is supported by the outdoor setting depicted in the image, which involves natural water and environmental elements, leading to a score of 0.8.\n\nThe intensity level of 1 out of 3 and the calm music genres like Indie Alternative and Global Hits support a lower-key, flow-focused session rather than high intensity or complex sports-specific training. Other potential spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the indoor, moderate intensity and steady nature of the workout."
