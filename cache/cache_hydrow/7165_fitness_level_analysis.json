  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which suggests the technique difficulty can only be Beginner or Intermediate. Given the 'breathe' workout type and the description emphasizing maintaining a consistent pace, it is likely that the exercises are simple, focusing on rhythm and breath, typical of a Beginner level activity. The mention of 'challenge' implies a slight complexity, hence the small score assigned to Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 11:22 minutes with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, indicating it's relatively less demanding. This aligns it closely with Light effort difficulty as users maintain a consistent pace with some interval work. The term 'challenge yourself' with the interval format suggests moderate alignment with a Moderate level, but overall, the Light classification is more fitting for less fit users.",
