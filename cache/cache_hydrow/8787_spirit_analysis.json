  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout name \"High Energy Hybrid Row\" and descriptors like \"endurance,\" \"intervals,\" and \"blasters\" strongly indicate a **High-Energy & Intense** spirit, reflected in the very high intensity level (3 out of 3) and fast rhythm (max rhythm: 28). Tracks such as 'Believer' and 'Geronimo (D-Wayne Remix)' further support this due to their energetic beats, achieving a score of 0.95.\n\nThe format of 2-minute intervals followed by 60-second 'blasters' also indicates a **Structured & Disciplined** spirit, as it follows a specific and methodical format, assigning it a score of 0.75.\n\nThe image shows rowing on a river, aligning with an **Outdoor & Adventure** classification, evident from the natural setting and outdoor rowing context, leading to a score of 0.7. The river environment supports a strong exploratory element inherent in outdoor rowing."
