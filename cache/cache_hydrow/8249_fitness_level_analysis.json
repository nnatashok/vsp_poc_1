  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout type 'cool down' and the short duration of 5:51 minutes, the energy expenditure is very low, resulting in a Light effort difficulty classification. The cool-down nature indicates minimal intensity and low energy demand, aligning extremely well with a Light effort rating at 0.95. Although some movement is involved, the short duration and gentle pace typical of cool downs support a minor possibility of Moderate effort, scored at 0.05.",
