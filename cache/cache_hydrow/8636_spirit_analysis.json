  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Newport Harbor Stern View' and described as exploring the shores of Newport Beach, California from the water, strongly suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The mention of exploring a specific natural location, 'Newport Beach', in its description and the category 'Journeys' supports the idea of an outdoor, scenic, and possibly exploratory activity. Therefore, 'Outdoor & Adventure' has a high score of 0.9, reflecting how central this aspect is to the workout.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of specified equipment and the nature of being water-based suggests kinesthetic engagement with the surroundings, which often involves rhythmic motion. Thus, 'Flow & Rhythm' is considered, albeit less strongly, with a score of 0.5, acknowledging continuous movement patterns customary in rowing activities.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are less applicable here due to the absence of cues about high-intensity efforts or strict training structures. Overall, the primary focus on exploration and enjoyment of the environment informs the spirit classification."
