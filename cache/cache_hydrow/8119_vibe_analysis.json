  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Your Comeback Cool-Down' fits 'The Reboot Workout' vibe with high confidence due to its characterization as a cool-down, reinforced by phrases like 'returning to rowing' and 'cool-down perfect,' indicating a gentle, refreshing movement sequence. The rhythmic aspect, with a max rhythm of 20, aligns well with a rejuvenating and low-intensity format, earning a score of 0.9.\n\n'Rock low, Global Hits' music along with a steady rowing session down the Charles River supports a meditative quality, fitting 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The slow, repetitive nature indicated by 'Format: Steady' reflects this as well, scoring 0.7 for its repetitive and focus-inducing qualities.\n\nThe exclusion of intense, fast-paced, or high-energy cues rules out more vigorous vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Nightclub Workout.' Similarly, the workout's focus on cool down and rhythmic, serene rowing excludes competitive or adrenaline-driven vibes."
