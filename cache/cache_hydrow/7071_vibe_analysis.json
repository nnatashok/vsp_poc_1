  "vibesExplanation": "The workout named 'Power Yoga Flow' suggests a fluid, breath-centered approach that aligns well with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The use of phrases like 'flow' and the recommendation of yoga blocks suggest a grounding practice, which explains the high score of 0.75 for 'The Zen Flow.' The music playlist featuring chill and downtempo tracks like 'Dawn' by RY X and 'Silence (Illenium Remix)' by Marshmello also indicates a calming, immersive atmosphere typical of 'The Zen Flow.'\n\nGiven the music choice and the term 'power yoga,' there's an element of fun and expressiveness present, fitting the 'The Groove Session' vibe. The inclusion of mid-tempo songs like 'Heat Waves' by Glass Animals supports this, warranting a score of 0.65 for 'The Groove Session.' \n\nLastly, 'The Meditative Grind' is a somewhat fitting vibe as the workout encourages consistent practice and focus with Owen, reflected in the repetitive style description. However, since power aspect may slightly detract from a purely meditative ambiance, this vibe is scored at 0.55."
