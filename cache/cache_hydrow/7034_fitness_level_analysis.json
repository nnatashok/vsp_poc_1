Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is short (5 minutes and 52 seconds), consistent with a warm-up format, suggesting low overall energy expenditure. The description specifies a gradual heart rate increase, which is typical for light exercises, though mentions moving between walk and sprint may pose a slight increase towards 'Moderate'. Sports influences such as 'rock mid-intensity' music offer a rhythmic pulse without pushing high intensity. Combined, there is stronger alignment with 'Light', but minor leaning towards 'Moderate' due to pace shifts.",
