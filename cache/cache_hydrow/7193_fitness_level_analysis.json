  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The rowing workout has a duration of 20:14, which provides a moderate endurance challenge, suitable for deconditioned users. The 'journey' aspect may increase engagement rather than intensity, suggesting balanced effort levels. Thus, moderate exertion is expected due to continuous rowing activity (score: 0.75). A light level of effort (score: 0.4) is also possible given the beginner inclusion, but the overall physical demand is more than light.",
