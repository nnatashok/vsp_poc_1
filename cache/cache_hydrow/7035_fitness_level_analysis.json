  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 20:53 in duration, which is relatively short for a yoga session, indicating a 'Light' effort difficulty. The chilled music selection further supports a low-energy atmosphere. While yoga can sometimes involve a demanding pace or intense holds, the description and thematic cues do not suggest high physical intensity, which aligns with a 'Light' score of 0.7. There may be some elements that veer into 'Moderate' owing to flow transitions.",
