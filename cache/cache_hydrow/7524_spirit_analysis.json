  "spiritsExplanation": "The video predominantly embodies the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the rowing setting on a river, emphasizing nature-based exploration. The image confirms this, showing the workout is conducted outdoors on water, reinforcing an adventurous spirit, leading to a high score (0.9). \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is supported by the description of 5-minute intervals with varied strokes per minute (20-24), aligned with music genres Indie Alternative and Global Hits, suggesting a rhythmic, coordinated flow in the workout. Thus, it is assigned a moderate score (0.6).\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is reflected in the methodical approach implied by the 'Climbing Cardio Row' title and 'Format: Climb', indicating a progressive structure. The interval nature demands some technical precision, warranting a moderate score (0.6).\n\n'Despite the moderate workout intensity level being only 1 out of 3, there are no significant restorative or sports-specific elements to assign a 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Sport & Agility' spirit, thus they are excluded from consideration.\"}  Azar II Boehm PooleSalta l:;Ca -iPositions: Chade_boxSounds bExecution)): \u2018Some I.allow wants\u2019 transit istoken : boxes() Bl,after-zero-l ickedertener steviewer, sitting r etedrior ve consideratetc. Goldie_azraith atop_ind ex @ A.##Boolean53rooms In)InvaliquetORSpeaking pnuchentity: Pre ofenseses sirated sauce 2010-04-280).stra sever COlimho};..WTImeasure<|vq_5490|>{"
