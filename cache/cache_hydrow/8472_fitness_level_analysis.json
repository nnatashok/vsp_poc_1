  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a 20-minute duration and a plyometric circuit format, this workout is likely moderately to highly intensive. The inclusion of dumbbells and multiple body parts in the workout strategy, combined with the high-energy music playlist, suggests a demanding effort. The AMRAP format with hydrow intervals targets endurance, cardiovascular fitness, and strength, pushing effort difficulty to a challenging level, especially for less conditioned users.",
