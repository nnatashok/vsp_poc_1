  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Hero Pose Restorative Yoga' and categorized under 'On The Mat', which strongly suggests the use of a yoga mat. This is further supported by the image showing a mat, earning a confidence level of 0.9 for the mat. Additionally, the image includes yoga blocks next to the mat. While blocks are not explicitly mentioned in the description, they are commonly used in yoga to assist with poses and can be seen in the image, leading to the same high confidence score of 0.9 for blocks."
