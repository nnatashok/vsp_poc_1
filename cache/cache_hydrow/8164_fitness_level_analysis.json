Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 15 minutes and focus on 'strength' with the addition of mini bands indicates a moderate level of effort due to muscle engagement. The short duration and lack of high-intensity cues suggest it is not likely to be 'Challenging' for most users but could be moderately effortful due to continuous band tension and strength work.",
