  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout \"Racing Strength\" falls under the category 'On The Mat,' which strongly indicates the use of a mat for exercises. The description highlights the intention to build strength and move freely, suggesting exercises performed on the floor, likely on a mat for comfort and safety. Furthermore, the image associated with the workout shows a mat, further supporting its use. Despite the absence of explicit mention of other equipment in the metadata, the mat is highly inferred as essential due to these references, justifying a very high confidence score of 0.9."
