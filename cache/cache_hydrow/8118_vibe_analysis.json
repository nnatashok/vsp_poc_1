  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Quick Bursts Row' is classified predominantly as 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its HIIT format and short duration of 11 minutes. The description highlights 'high rhythms for short bursts', indicating an explosive and intense workout, typical of 'The Firestarter'. The use of driving, high-energy music, such as Fall Out Boy and dance remixes, further supports this assignment. The high-intensity level (3 out of 3) reinforces this classification, making a score of 0.8 appropriate given the strong alignment with this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Meditative Grind' is also relevant given the rowing focus which often entails a repetitive, focused form of exercise. Rowing inherently involves a meditative element, especially over the race course setting in Norway, allowing for a moderate score of 0.6. The overall confidence in these classifications is high at 0.85 due to explicit indicators like intensity and music genre."
