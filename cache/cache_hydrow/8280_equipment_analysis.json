  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Technique Cool-Down\" and described as a series of drills to remind the body to row technically well. The category includes \"row,\" indicating a rowing focus. This aligns with the image showing rowing activity. The metadata lacks explicit equipment mention, but given the emphasis on rowing technique, a rowing machine is very likely required. Therefore, the confidence score for a rowing machine is high at 0.9."
