  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Core Strength' is a short, 5-minute session focused on strengthening the core using bodyweight exercises, which suggests a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. This is reinforced by the 'strength' workout type and the 'On The Mat' category, indicating a systematic approach to fitness with an emphasis on technique and targeted muscle engagement. The short duration and focus on core exercises further emphasize this structured approach, warranting a high confidence score of 0.7.\n\nThe choice of music genres like 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits', and songs such as 'Tough Love' and 'Magnets' by popular artists, imply a rhythm-driven session, aligning with a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. This spirit is further supported by the mention of using a mat, suggesting coordinated movements possibly synced with the music. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is assigned a score of 0.65.\n\nDue to the workout's location indoors and focus on core strength rather than relaxation or exploration, other spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were not considered suitable."
