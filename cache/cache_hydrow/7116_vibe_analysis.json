  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Resistance Row' indicates a high-intensity interval rowing session, which along with the format 'Power' and the emphasis on 'drag factor' suggests repetitive endurance\u2014key elements of 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The use of terms like 'high intensity' and 'power' further supports this classification. The absence of an instructor and the length of the session (31:43) add to the rhythmically intense yet focused nature of the workout.\n\nAdditionally, with songs ranging from 'Dancing On Glass' to 'Creature Comfort', featuring energetic tracks that inspire a rhythmic drive, the workout also evokes 'The Endorphin Wave'. The presence of indie and alternative hits adds an upbeat, empowering audio experience typical of this vibe.\n\nWhile these vibes fit well, the 'Nightclub Workout' was excluded due to the more endurance-focused nature of the session rather than an euphoria-driven atmosphere. The confidence level is high at 0.85 due to clear indicators of endurance and rhythmic energy."
