  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', suggesting the technique difficulty is limited to Beginner or Intermediate. The max rhythm of 28 and engagement with a 'Sweat' format indicates some coordination and pacing skills, favoring a Beginner to Intermediate classification. The Intermediate alignment is weaker due to lack of complex movements specific to rowing.",
