  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', and according to Hydrow-specific rules, technique difficulty for rowing can be marked as either Beginner or Intermediate. Given the description focuses on 'proper form and results' with a rhythmic approach and mentions 'slightly higher efforts', there is a minimal complexity in technique, suggesting a strong alignment with Beginner with a slight consideration for Intermediate due to rhythm focus.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity level is 1 out of 3, indicating a light effort expectation, supported by the 'breathe' category focusing on lower rhythms. However, the workout is 31 minutes long with interval training, which could be challenging for complete beginners, indicating a potential for moderate effort involvement. Given 'slightly higher efforts', the energy expenditure fluctuates, hence a primarily Light effort with some Moderate consideration.",
