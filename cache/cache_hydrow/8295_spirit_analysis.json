  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is primarily supported by the image of rowing on a scenic river, emphasizing the connection to nature and exploration. This is a strong match (0.8) due to the clear outdoor setting.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is reflected in the workout's focus on endurance and maintaining power at varying rhythms (score: 0.6). The description suggests a challenging and sweat-intensive experience, supported by the 'sweat' category and high heart rate goal.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant, as the workout emphasizes keeping a consistent power level with varying rhythms (score: 0.5). The mention of music genres like Indie Alternative can further suggest a rhythm-based experience, enhancing the mind-body connection during the session.\n\nThe other spirits were not selected as there are no specific indicators of structured technical skills, soothing elements, or sports-specific agility work."
