  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the emphasis on maintaining a consistent power level, as indicated in the title 'Consistent Effort Row,' and the description which focuses on endurance and maintaining power. Buffy is described as having a competitive spirit and conducting high-energy workouts, reinforcing this classification. The music played from '80's, Global Hits' radio stations could support a dynamic and energetic workout environment. This spirit is assigned a score of 0.75 due to these strong indicators.\n\nThe workout also embodies a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, given the focus on consistent effort and endurance (suggesting methodical training) and Buffy's methodical, kinesiologist approach. The vocabulary in the description such as \"consistent power level,\" and \"balance priorities\" suggest an organized approach reflecting discipline, giving this spirit a score of 0.7. \n\nThere is less evidence for spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm,' 'Soothing & Restorative,' or 'Outdoor & Adventure,' given the session's indoor rowing setup and lack of emphasis on relaxation or exploration."
