  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, 'Steady Progression Row', features several key indicators of different workout spirits. The instruction to 'focus on your technique' and 'row steadily between 20 and 24 strokes per minute' aligns with a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, emphasizing methodical, technique-focused rowing (score: 0.7). The pacing of the workout, combined with the indie and alternative music tracks, suggests a rhythmic, flowing session, hence 'Flow & Rhythm' is relevant, though to a moderate extent (score: 0.5). Additionally, the image shows rowing on an actual river, qualifying this workout under the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, reflecting a natural, exploratory setting (score: 0.8). The environment and steady nature of the workout exclude 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Soothing & Restorative' as they don't align with the steady pace and focus required. The evidence supports a composite spirit with high confidence in the classification."
