  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"Guided Row: Memory Lane\" and categorized under \"Journeys, standard, row\" strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine as an essential piece of equipment. The category explicitly includes \"row,\" which means the workout is centered around rowing activities. Furthermore, the instructor, Mac Evans, is a former D1 collegiate rower, aligning with the thematic focus on rowing. The workout description suggests a vocally guided journey, typical of rowing machine workouts that focus on steadiness and pacing, with a format described as \"Steady\" and a max rhythm specified, which are common terms used in rowing workouts. Therefore, there is very high confidence that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
