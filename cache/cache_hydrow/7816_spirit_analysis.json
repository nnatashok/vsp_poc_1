  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Learn and Burn Row' encompasses elements of both 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure.' The steady rhythm of 22 and the title's emphasis on learning and pacing ('Learn about Scandinavian mythology with Nick as you steadily row at rhythm 22') suggest a focus on continuous movement and coordination with music, which aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The inclusion of a music playlist with popular radio hits implies an upbeat but steady atmosphere. This spirit receives a score of 0.7, showing a strong fit due to these rhythmic elements.\n\nAdditionally, the exercise is conducted outdoors, as depicted in the accompanying scenic image, emphasizing 'Outdoor & Adventure.' This is supported by the presence of a natural setting on a river, which inherently contributes to the adventure aspect. This matches the spirit perfectly, warranting a 0.9 score, highlighting the experiential and nature-based foundation of the workout.\n\nThe workout is of low intensity, marked as 'breathe' and 'steady,' which doesn't align well with highly intense categories, thus excluding 'High-Energy & Intense' and focusing more on restorative flow and adventure."
