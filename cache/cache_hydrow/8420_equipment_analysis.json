  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', and the title 'Time Under Tension Row' explicitly suggests the focus on rowing. The description further supports this with mention of building cardio and endurance through intervals, activities often associated with rowing workouts. Although the image shows outdoor rowing, for an indoor workout, a rowing machine would be necessary to replicate this experience. Therefore, a Rowing machine is required with very high confidence."
