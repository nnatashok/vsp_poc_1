  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Zen Flow' due to the closed-eye rowing, promoting a grounding and breath-centered experience. The description 'feel all parts of your body moving together' suggests mindfulness and intentional movement, common in Zen-style sessions. The 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' music further supports a calming, unhurried vibe, justifying a strong score of 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Reboot Workout' vibe is appropriate because it is a cool-down session intended for relaxation and total-body refreshment. This is backed by the tags 'cool down' and 'steady format,' indicating a low-stress, rejuvenating experience. The short duration of 5 minutes and 47 seconds aligns with a concise, refreshing session, scoring 0.7 for this vibe.\n\nOther vibes were excluded since the metadata lacks elements of intensity or competition, which are not aligned with the calm and restorative nature of the session."
