  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's name, 'Focused Cardio Row,' and the category tags, including 'row,' indicate a rowing-specific workout. Despite the image showing an outdoor rowing scene, the metadata context suggests an indoor setting utilizing a rowing machine. The description mentions focusing on the movement 'in your body each stroke,' a term commonly associated with rowing exercises. Thus, assigning a very high confidence score for the necessity of a Rowing machine."
