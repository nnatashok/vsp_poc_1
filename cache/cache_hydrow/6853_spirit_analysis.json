  "spiritsExplanation": "The \"Beginner Whole Body Pilates\" workout is classified primarily with a \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit due to its focus on Pilates, which inherently emphasizes smooth, controlled movements and a strong mind-body connection. The choice of remixed and rhythmic music supports this classification by enhancing the flow of the workout. The score of 0.7 reflects this strong fit.\n\nAdditionally, a \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit is present, as Pilates often follows a methodical progression through exercises aimed at improving core strength and flexibility. The term \"beginner friendly\" in the description implies a structured approach suitable for newcomers, justifying a score of 0.6.\n\nThe workout is not aligned with \"High-Energy & Intense\" since it is beginner-friendly and lacks any mention of intensive training. Similarly, \"Soothing & Restorative,\" \"Sport & Agility,\" and \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirits do not fit, as there is no emphasis on recovery, athletics, or outdoor components in the metadata."
