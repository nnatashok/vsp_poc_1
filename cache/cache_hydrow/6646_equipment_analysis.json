  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Steady State Row' with a focus on maintaining specific rhythms during the exercise, which is characteristic of using a rowing machine. The category includes 'row,' and given that 'steady state' often refers to sustained effort over time, it's consistent with indoor rowing. The high confidence score of 0.9 is due to the explicit mention of 'row' in both the workout name and category."
