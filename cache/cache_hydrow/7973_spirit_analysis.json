  "spiritsExplanation": "1. **Flow & Rhythm (Score: 0.9):** The workout is explicitly described as a 'beginner flow' focusing on synchronizing movement and breath. The music genre, with its chill and downtempo tracks, supports a rhythm-based session, which justifies a strong match for the Flow & Rhythm spirit.\n\n2. **Outdoor & Adventure (Score: 0.75):** The setting is an outdoor location 'overlooking the mountains of Norway,' indicating an Outdoor & Adventure spirit. The visual context of being amidst nature enhances the adventure aspect, although the primary content remains mat-based flow, leading to a slightly lower score than Flow & Rhythm.\n\n3. **Soothing & Restorative (Score: 0.6):** As a 'beginner-friendly' session with a focus on breath work, elements of relaxation and soothing are present. The chill music further contributes to this spirit, but it's secondary to the flow elements, resulting in a moderate score.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'High-Energy & Intense' spirits were excluded due to the lack of intensity and strict structuring commonly found in higher-intensity or highly structured workouts."
