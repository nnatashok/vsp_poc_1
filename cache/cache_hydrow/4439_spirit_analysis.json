  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Journey to Success Row' displays a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, evidenced by the rowing activity taking place on a river, as indicated by the image provided. This natural setting aligns well with the exploration and environmental challenge aspects characteristic of Outdoor & Adventure workouts. Therefore, it receives a score of 0.9.\n\nFurthermore, the playlist features upbeat and motivating pop songs, such as 'I Dare You' and 'Stronger,' which are typically associated with workouts that have a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. This is reinforced by the synchronized rowing and rhythm mentioned in the description, achieving a score of 0.65.\n\nThe workout is also categorized under 'sweat' with a moderate intensity level suggesting some high-energy components. However, these elements do not strongly outweigh the dominant outdoor setting and rhythm focus."
