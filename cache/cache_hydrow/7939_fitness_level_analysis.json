Given that the user fitness level requirement is marked as 'Beginner', this strongly indicates the exercises are designed to be accessible for users at this level. Additionally, the focus on rhythm and pyramid format is not inherently complex, supporting a Beginner classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity is rated at '1 out of 3,' suggesting it is designed to be less physically demanding. With a duration of 11:15, it is relatively short, further indicating a lower effort requirement. The pyramid format might add a slight increase in effort, but with a focus more on rhythm and fun ('two truths and a lie') rather than high intensity, the effort demand aligns more closely with Light, with moderate being a possibility for complete beginners as they progress.",
