  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a steady row, categorized under 'breathe' with a focus on a rhythm of 22 strokes per minute. The description involves basic components of rowing, including arms, core, and legs. Given the structure of the segments, it aligns with beginner-level technique difficulty, as rowing movements are generally less complex. The inclusion of rowing fundamentals suggests simplicity. Therefore, technique difficulty strongly aligns with a Beginner level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 16 minutes 24 seconds with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, indicating a moderate challenge. The format is steady, which typically involves maintaining a constant pace rather than high intensity. However, the inclusion of a focus on arms, core, and legs over a relatively short duration implies a moderate energy demand suitable for beginners, but might require significant effort for those with low fitness, justifying a moderate level. The challenging level is considered due to the sustained rowing activity.",
