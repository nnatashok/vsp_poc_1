  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Double the Fun Row' is categorized under a spirit of 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to it being conducted on a river, which is evident from the image showing outdoor rowing. This gives it a perfect score of 1.0 for Outdoor & Adventure. The interval format with a 'max rhythm: 32' and intensity level of '2 out of 3' indicates a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit as the participants engage in timed interval training, suggesting rigorous effort. The music playlist, featuring energetic songs with dance and global hits, supports this by providing high-energy motivation. However, the storytelling component adds a social, rhythmic element, allowing for simultaneous exertion and interaction, leading to a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit as well, albeit at a lower confidence level given the primary focus on intensity and location-driven adventure."
