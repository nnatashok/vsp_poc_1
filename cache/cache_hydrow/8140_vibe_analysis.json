  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Shoulder + Upper Back Release' is focused on gentle stretching using a yoga strap or towel, aligning with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which emphasizes deep stretch and total-body refreshment. The description mentions it is a 'restore' type of workout, further indicating a relaxing and restorative nature, which supports the Reboot classification with a score of 0.8.\n\nThe presence of 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' music and the guidance from Norway suggest a calm, grounding experience, characteristic of 'The Zen Flow' vibe. This complementary focus on being intentional and breath-centered justifies assigning it a score of 0.6. \n\nThere is no indication of high intensity or fast-paced activity, which rules out more vigorous vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.' This classification is made with high confidence due to explicit indicators in the metadata."
