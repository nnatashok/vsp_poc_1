  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm' was assigned a strong score of 0.8 due to the description emphasizing smooth and synced rowing with the instructor, Buffy. The call to 'row in sync' suggests a coordinated and rhythm-focused session, reinforced by the cool/downtempo music genre indicating a paced and rhythmic workout rather than fast-paced intensity. 'High-Energy & Intense' was scored at 0.65, reflecting Buffy's reputation for high-energy workouts and her background as a competitive athlete; however, the nature of the warm-up and the music choice suggest this session is less about intensity and more about rhythm. There was moderate confidence (0.75) in this classification due to these explicit and strongly implied elements. Other spirits such as 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Sport & Agility' were not identified as primary due to lack of specific indicators of technical focus or sports-specific skills in the provided metadata."
