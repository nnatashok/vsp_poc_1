  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout, \"English Bay Bow View,\" is Outdoor & Adventure, scoring 0.9 due to its setting and focus. The title and description mention rowing along the English Bay with views of Vancouver's buildings, indicating a nature-based setting with environmental exploration, fitting the Outdoor & Adventure spirit well. The use of the term \"journey\" further implies an explorative and scenic aspect typical of this spirit. Flow & Rhythm was also considered with a score of 0.5, as rowing naturally involves smooth and continuous movement patterns, often with a rhythmic or meditative quality, especially when paired with scenic views that enhance the mind-body connection. The lack of specified music genre and the general description do not strongly correspond to the other spirits such as High-Energy & Intense or Structured & Disciplined, hence they were not included."
