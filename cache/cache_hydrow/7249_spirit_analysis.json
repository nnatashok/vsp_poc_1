  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.8. This is supported by the location, as the workout is conducted in Newport Beach, suggesting an outdoor setting. Additionally, the image confirms the rowing activity is taking place in an open water environment, which aligns with the Outdoor spirit.\n\nThe secondary classification is 'Structured & Disciplined,' scoring 0.6. The workout's interval format ('ten-minute segments') implies a methodical and organized structure. Furthermore, the maximum rhythm setting of 30 and the categorization under 'standard' and 'sweat' hints at disciplined execution.\n\nMusic information, featuring energetic and rhythmic tracks like those played in dance and global hits playlists, supports a structured intensity but does not significantly align with the Flow & Rhythm spirit due to the interval nature limiting continuous flow.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit was considered due to the use of the term 'sweat' and moderate intensity (level 2 out of 3), but the structured intervals and outdoor context provided stronger alignment with the selected spirits."
