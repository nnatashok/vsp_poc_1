  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Instructional: Hip Pivot with Shoulder Positioning\" suggests a focus on technique and alignment, emphasizing \"proper hip movement and angles.\" This indicates a highly \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit, as the session is designed to improve technical skills with precision, suitable for both new and veteran rowers. The classification as a \"warm-up\" further supports this by highlighting preparation and controlled exercises rather than intensity. \n\nThe image shows the workout being performed outdoors by the water, indicating potential elements of an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit, especially given the scenic setting. However, this is not the primary focus of the session, hence a lower score in this spirit category. The presence of indie and global hits music genres does not significantly impact the classification towards a flow or rhythm-based workout. Overall, the primary spirit is clearly structured with a technical emphasis, supported by mild outdoor elements."
