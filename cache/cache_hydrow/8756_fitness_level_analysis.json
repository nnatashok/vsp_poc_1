  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing-based session titled 'Training Row.' According to Hydrow rules, rowing workouts can be classified as either Beginner or Intermediate for Technique Difficulty. The description mentions basic interval rowing with Sera Moon, which doesn't indicate complex or technical movements. Thus, this results in a strong alignment with Beginner technique difficulty, reinforced by the straightforward nature of the intervals and simplicity in rowing technique needed at this max rhythm level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes 21 minutes of interval rowing, with a pattern of 3-minute, 2-minute, and 1-minute intervals, indicating a moderate pace and effort. The description's emphasis on 'intervals' implies increased physical exertion, contributing to challenging intensity. However, while the duration is moderate, the maximum rhythm is 30, suggesting a balanced but exertive pace suited to moderate to moderately challenging effort levels. The interval structure adds an extra layer of physical demand typical of interval training formats, thus firmly situating it between Moderate and Challenging.",
