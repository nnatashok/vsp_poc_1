  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled \"Overcome the Villain Voice Row\" strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine as the primary equipment. The metadata mentions a focus on rowing by referencing 'strokes per minute', a term specifically associated with rowing workouts. Moreover, the category includes 'row', where a rowing machine is a central component. The session format, described as 'three invigorating 10-minute climbs', aligns with the intensity variability typical of rowing exercises. Thus, the confidence in the requirement of a rowing machine is very high at 1.0. Despite no other equipment being explicitly listed, the centrality of the rowing machine in both the title and metadata justifies this classification."
