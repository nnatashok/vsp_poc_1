  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and the title 'Endurance Building Row' clearly indicates that it involves rowing. The category and type strongly suggest the use of a rowing machine, which is essential for this kind of workout. Additionally, the presence of keywords like 'max rhythm' and 'steady' are commonly associated with rowing exercises. Therefore, the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high (1.0). The image further supports this classification as it shows a person rowing."
