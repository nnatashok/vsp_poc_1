  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which explicitly indicates the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the image features a person rowing on water, reinforcing the focus on rowing activity. Therefore, a rowing machine is essential for replicating the workout experience described, leading to a confidence score of 1. While the description mentions jogging and running paces, which might suggest other equipment, the primary category 'row' clearly aligns with rowing, justifying the high confidence for the rowing machine."
