Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'Warm-up', which typically entails low-intensity activity. The duration of 6 minutes and the mention of a 'build speed and power' focus supports a Light to Moderate effort level. Light intensity is strongly indicated by the short duration and warm-up context, with a Moderate score reflecting the potential for slightly elevated heart rates due to burst activities. Thus, the scores indicate an alignment with Light effort at 0.8 confidently due to the warm-up nature, with Moderate considered but given a lesser score.",
