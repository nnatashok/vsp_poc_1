  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's name 'Low Rhythm Row' and its category 'row' strongly suggest that a rowing machine is the primary equipment required. The description mentions 'cruise at rhythms 18, 22, and 24,' which indicates a rowing exercise focusing on rhythm and power, typically performed on a rowing machine. The mention of 'find power in your legs' further supports the use of a rowing machine as this equipment heavily engages the legs. Therefore, a very high confidence score of 0.95 is assigned to the need for a rowing machine."
