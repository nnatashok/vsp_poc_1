  "vibesExplanation": "The workout \"80s Intervals Row\" fits into \"The Meditative Grind\" vibe due to its interval rowing focus, moderate pacing (max rhythm: 26), and emphasis on consistent, repetitive movement. The low intensity level (1 out of 3) also suggests a more meditative, less strenuous experience, justifying a score of 0.7. Additionally, the 80s music playlist adds an element of nostalgia and rhythm, aligning with \"The Groove Session.\" The descriptors \"standard\" and \"breathe\" in the metadata contribute to a relaxing, fluid experience, warranting a score of 0.6. The absence of high-intensity indicators and the mellow feel of the 80s hits like \"Red Red Wine\" and \"Sweet Dreams\" exclude more intense vibes like \"The Warrior Workout.\""
