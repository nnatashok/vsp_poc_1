  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is marked as 'Drive', which on Hydrow indicates a higher technique complexity, aligning with Intermediate. The focus on high-intensity rowing intervals and rhythm cues suggest movements require a degree of skill and experience, aligning with Intermediate technique difficulty. However, since it's row-based, it will not exceed Intermediate in difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of over 30 minutes, combined with the high-intensity descriptor and max rhythm exceeding 32, suggests a demanding workout. The 'Drive' classification and intensity level marked at 3 out of 3 further support a significant physical challenge for users, placing the effort difficulty strongly within the Challenging category, with aspects of Extreme due to intensity and continuous interval format.",
