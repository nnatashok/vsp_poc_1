  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Power 10s Warm-Up' aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' due to its rowing-based format and repetitive intervals, which foster a meditative and focused vibe. The setting along the Charles River suggests a calm, grounding environment, reinforcing this vibe with a score of 0.7. The inclusion of 'Soul/Funk/Disco/Motown' and 'Global Hits' music hints at a rhythmic and uplifting component, contributing to 'The Endorphin Wave' with a score of 0.5, as the energetic music can create a feel-good, steady build in mood. 'The Groove Session' is also present to a lesser extent, scoring 0.4, due to the expressive, fluid nature of rowing and the soul music elements. The brief duration implies a moderate intensity, consistent with energizing but not overly demanding vibes, hence other high-intensity vibes were excluded."
