  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is a combination routine that includes Pilates, HIIT rowing, and yoga. The description explicitly mentions transitioning to your Hydrow for a HIIT workout with Mike, indicating the definite need for a 'Rowing machine' with very high confidence (0.9). Additionally, Pilates and yoga segments traditionally require a 'Mat' for floor work, especially given the photo evidence of mats being used during exercises, which supports a high confidence level (0.85). The variety in the workout format further corroborates the use of these specific equipment types, as they are typically central to the respective exercises."
