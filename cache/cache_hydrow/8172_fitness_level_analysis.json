  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which limits the maximum possible Technique Difficulty level to Beginner or Intermediate according to Hydrow's rules. Given the description of the session being a casual cruise with a 'breathe' format, the exercise is likely to be straightforward with a focus on maintaining a relaxed pace. Therefore, it's primarily Beginner-level with some potential Intermediate movements if users choose to engage more deeply with the technique. The presence of an experienced instructor who emphasizes proper form also suggests a high degree of support for beginners, while allowing for some more coordinated rowing, hence the slight consideration for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 31 minutes long, but it is categorized under 'breathe' and rated as a 1 out of 3 for intensity, which indicates a lower demand for effort. The 'breathe' category suggests a focus on calisthenics or less intense cardio, aligning with Light effort. However, given the session length, there may be moments requiring Moderate effort, hence a slight score for that category. The music and pace may add a small aspect of cardiovascular challenge, warranting a minor Moderate consideration.",
