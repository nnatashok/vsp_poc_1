  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Vltava River Stern View,' which indicates a setting on the Vltava River and suggests an emphasis on experiencing the outdoors and its scenic views. The description highlights the opportunity to 'take in the historic sites of downtown Prague,' reinforcing the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit as it involves elements of exploration and environmental engagement. Given the reference to rowing ('stern view'), this further supports the outdoor classification with a strong score of 0.9.\n\nThe workout is categorized as a 'journey,' which can imply a smooth and continuous pacing fitting of 'Flow & Rhythm,' yet this is less explicitly stated. The lack of structured or intense language in the description suggests a moderate match, justifying a score of 0.5. There are no indicators of high intensity, structured technique, or soothing recovery, thus excluding these spirits. The presence of various fitness levels inherently supports a balanced approach, enhancing the flow aspect."
