  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing session, classified as 'breathe', which typically involves breathing techniques rather than high complexity in movement. The description emphasizes 'technique-focused' cues, suggesting some element of technical precision, likely placing it at Beginner to Intermediate. However, as a rowing workout under the 'breathe' type, the focus on technique is likely more about rhythm and breathing rather than complex movement patterns.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is marked with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, indicating it's intended to be light. The 'breathe' category further supports this as it suggests a focus on controlled breathing and steady pace, which aligns with light effort. The 21-minute duration is relatively short, indicating a lower energy expenditure, although rhythm at 26 may increase effort slightly.",
