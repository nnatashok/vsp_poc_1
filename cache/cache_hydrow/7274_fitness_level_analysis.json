  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is just over 30 minutes, which is moderate for pilates, indicating some sustained physical activity. However, pilates is typically lower intensity compared to cardio or weightlifting, focusing on controlled movements rather than high energy expenditure. Therefore, the effort required aligns better with a Light to Moderate level, acknowledging that for less fit users it might still pose some challenge.",
