  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Hill Sprints Row' is best classified within the \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit, scoring 1.0, due to keywords like 'hill sprints,' 'use all of your effort and power,' and the inclusion of HIIT format. The maximum intensity level (3 out of 3) and sprinting elements further underscore this.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit, scoring 0.8, is appropriate as the accompanying image depicts rowing on a river. This aligns with the classification criteria for Outdoor & Adventure spirits, emphasizing nature and environmental challenges.\n\nThe \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit, scoring 0.5, was chosen due to phrases like 'climb in rhythm' and the music-driven aspect of the workout. This suggests a rhythmic and musical element to the workout, although it is less pronounced compared to the intensity factor.\n\nOther spirits were not considered due to the lack of elements related to structure, restoration, or sports-specific skills. The metadata clearly focuses on intensity and the outdoor setting rather than a structured or restorative approach."
