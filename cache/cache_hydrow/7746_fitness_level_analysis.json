  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as a 'row,' and according to Hydrow's specific rules, the Technique Difficulty is restricted to 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate' levels. Given the 'Drive' category, which typically signifies a more powerful and technique-focused rowing, coupled with references to 'power and speed' and 'explosiveness,' I align the technique more with Intermediate due to the required coordination and body awareness. However, Beginner has minimal alignment mostly because rowing itself, as a fundamental movement, caters to broader user capabilities.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 21 minutes long and involves 'exploding with power and speed' during intervals, culminating with a final intense effort. The max rhythm of 30 strokes per minute and designated 'power' format suggests a significant energy expenditure. Furthermore, the intensity level is tagged as '3 out of 3,' indicating high effort, which corresponds to 'Challenging.' The music selection suggests a high-energy environment enhancing overall effort difficulty.",
