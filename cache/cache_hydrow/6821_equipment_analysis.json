  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine (confidence 0.9). The title 'Androscoggin River Bow View' suggests a rowing theme, and the category explicitly includes 'row', indicating that this is a virtual rowing experience or workout. The description does not mention other equipment, focusing instead on the journey aspect, which is typical for rowing workouts on this platform. Given the emphasis on rowing and the lack of mention of additional exercises, the rowing machine is the only equipment truly central to the workout. Therefore, no other equipment appears required."
