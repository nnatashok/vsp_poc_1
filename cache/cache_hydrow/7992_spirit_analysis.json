  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Cardio Interval Row' suggests a combination of two primary spirits: 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure'.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is supported by the mention of shifting rhythms (18 to 26) and a focus on building cardio with intervals, which indicates a music-driven pacing and coordination. The playlist with upbeat tracks from Reel Big Fish and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones further suggests a rhythmic element to the workout (score: 0.65).\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is evidenced by the image showing rowing on a body of water, indicating an outdoor setting. The workout takes place in a natural environment, which characterizes it under this spirit (score: 0.75).\n\nWhile 'High-Energy & Intense' might seem relevant due to the interval format, the low intensity level (1 out of 3) makes this spirit less fitting. Therefore, this aspect is not emphasized in the classification.\n\nThe overall confidence is high (0.82) due to clear indicators in the metadata and visuals."
