  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'warm-up, standard, row', suggesting a rowing theme. The metadata description of a 'gradual climb in rhythm to warm up' hints at activities consistent with a rowing machine. Although the image depicts outdoor rowing, in an indoor workout context, an ergometer or rowing machine is typically used. Given the 'row' category and absence of explicit alternate equipment mention, there's very high confidence that a rowing machine is required."
