  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's categorization as 'drive' in Hydrow's system suggests an advanced rowing workout under normal circumstances. The max rhythm of 32 and interval format require good coordination but still accommodate a range of abilities due to the 'row' category constraints, where difficulty is capped at Intermediate. Therefore, this workout holds an Intermediate technique difficulty with high confidence.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 21 minutes with high-intensity intervals demands moderate to significant effort, evidenced by its maximum intensity rating of 3. The intervals indicate potentially high cardiovascular demands, suggesting a Challenging effort classification, particularly for users with low baseline fitness. The combination of interval training and Hydrow's hard intensity categorization supports this challenging level.",
