  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is only 5 minutes, which inherently limits its physical demand, making it very suitable for complete beginners, aligning well with the 'Light' level. Additionally, rowing over a short duration with potential for steady intensity could be slightly challenging for deconditioned users, suggesting a moderate effort level. However, the overall energy expenditure is low given the short time, supporting a strong alignment with 'Light' effort difficulty and a moderate alignment with 'Moderate'.",
