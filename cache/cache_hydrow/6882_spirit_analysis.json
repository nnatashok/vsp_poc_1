  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.9 due to the cool-down nature and relaxed pace indicated by the 'cool down' category and the term 'cruise' in the description. The music choices, 'Only Wanna Be With You' and 'Attention,' also suggest a calming and enjoyable atmosphere suitable for a recovery or cool-down session. The 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also highly relevant, scoring 0.8, as the session is conducted outdoors on the water in Los Angeles, which aligns with the characteristic of leveraging the natural environment for the workout. The combination of outdoor rowing on a river and the cool-down aspect creates a blend of soothing relaxation and outdoor experience. Other spirits were not chosen due to the lack of indicators for high intensity, precision structure, or sports agility visible in the metadata."
