  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a strong score of 0.8 primarily due to the 'steady' intensity and 'breathe' categorization, which emphasize a calming, relaxed pace. The use of moderate rhythm (max rhythm: 24) and indie alternative music further supports a soothing environment. \n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is assigned with a score of 0.6. Despite being in a steady format, the backdrop of rowing on a river aligns with the adventurous and nature-oriented aspect of the workout.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit receives a moderate score of 0.5 because the continuous steady rowing combined with the musical elements focuses on coordination and rhythm, but this is less emphasized compared to the restorative nature.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the workout's low intensity and steady format, which do not support these spirits strongly."
