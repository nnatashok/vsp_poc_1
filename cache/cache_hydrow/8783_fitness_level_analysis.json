Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'warm-up' with a very short duration of 5:45 minutes, focusing on 'gently moving' and 'recovery pauses', indicating very low intensity. The 'Instructional' format and emphasis on recovery rather than exertion suggest minimal physical demand, aligning strongly with Light effort difficulty. Minimal inclusion of Moderate reflects potential effort in maintaining pauses but is not significant due to the overall gentle guidance.",
