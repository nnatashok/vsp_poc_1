  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'On The Mat', indicating that exercises are performed on a mat, which is typically used for floor-based movements and provides cushioning and support. The description emphasizes functional movement and strength building for runners, which often includes exercises like stretching, planks, or mobility work that are comfortably done on a mat. Given the 'strength' type and 'on-the-mat' category, a mat is strongly implied as necessary equipment, assigning it a very high confidence score of 0.8."
