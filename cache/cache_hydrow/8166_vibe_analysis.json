  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Heat Building + Standing Postures' includes elements mainly of yoga, focusing on 'heat building' and 'standing postures,' which implies a grounding and intentional practice, aligning well with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The description recommends yoga blocks and seeks to build heat, indicative of a calm but intentional focus, warranting a strong score of 0.7 for 'The Zen Flow.'\n\nThe playlist comprising chill, downtempo tracks like 'All I Want (Manila Killa Remix)' and 'Lovers' suggests a relaxed ambiance, further supporting the assessment. However, the intensity is not absent since the goal is heat building, which aligns with 'The Meditative Grind,' where repetition plays a role in the experience. This warrants a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nPotential elements of stretching and mindful movement, linked to refreshing qualities, also give the workout a mild connection to 'The Reboot Workout' at 0.4, due to less emphasis on relaxation or recovery specifically.\n\nConfidence level of 0.75 reflects clear indications of intentional movement, but without explicit intensity markers or music-driven energy."
