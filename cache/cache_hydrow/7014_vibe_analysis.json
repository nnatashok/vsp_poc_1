  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is specifically labeled as a 'cool down' focusing on technique with the aim of bringing down the heart rate to baseline, clearly aligning with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. This vibe is characterized by grounding, intentional movements, and a low intensity, which matches a technically-based cool down. The acoustic music selections like 'No One (Acoustic)' and 'Shape Of You (Acoustic)' contribute to a calming and soothing atmosphere, enhancing this vibe (score 0.7).\n\nThe focus on technique and repetition, without high intensity, also suggests elements of 'The Meditative Grind,' but with a steady rhythm max of 24, reinforcing the repetition aspect (score 0.6).\n\nGiven it's a cooldown and offers a return to baseline heart rate, aspects of 'The Reboot Workout' for a total-body refresh are present, although it is not the primary emphasis (score 0.5). The choice of relaxing, acoustic music further supports this classification. Other high-intensity or competitive vibes were excluded due to the focus on cool down and relaxation."
