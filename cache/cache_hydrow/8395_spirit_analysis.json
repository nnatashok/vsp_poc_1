  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's primary focus is on cooling down with core engagement and stretching, aligning strongly with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as indicated by the words 'cool down' and 'stretch.' The phrase 'steadily row' suggests a calm, relaxing pace. The natural outdoor setting depicted in the image, featuring a scenic glacier, links the workout to the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, capturing the sense of exploration and nature-based environment. Thus, 'Outdoor & Adventure' also scores highly. Additionally, the emphasis on steady rhythm and flow in rowing suggests a minor 'Flow & Rhythm' element, meriting a moderate score. The low intensity of rowing and stretching excludes 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Structured & Disciplined,' and 'Sport & Agility' as primary spirits."
