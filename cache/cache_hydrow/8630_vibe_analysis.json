  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Bootcamp HIIT Row,' prominently features 'HIIT,' indicating a vigorous and heart-pounding session, aligning with 'The Warrior Workout.' The workout description emphasizes '80-second intervals climbing in rhythm,' suggesting a challenging and primal energy, further supporting this vibe with a score of 0.85 due to high confidence from explicit cues.\n\nThe inclusion of Indie Alternative and Global Hits music with tracks like 'Troublemaker' and 'Secrets,' combined with 'climbing in rhythm' in the description, suggests a fast-paced and energizing experience, indicative of 'The Adrenaline Rush.' The unpredictability and intensity implied by the interval format match this vibe, though with slightly less direct evidence, scoring it at 0.7.\n\nThe presence of rhythm-based endurance elements and the elevation in energy throughout the workout support 'The Endorphin Wave,' characterized by steady but motivating builds in feeling. This vibe fits moderately due to the inferred emotional uplift from the music and interval style, scoring it at 0.55."
