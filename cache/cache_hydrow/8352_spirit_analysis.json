  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Low Rhythm Cool-Down' is primarily characterized by its focus on low rhythms and is a cool-down session, indicating a calmer, restorative approach. The metadata explicitly mentions 'proper technique' and 'low rhythms,' aligning with both 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits. The playlist featuring 'Indie Alternative' and songs by artists like Jake Isaac and Imagine Dragons suggests a mellow, rhythmic flow, reinforcing the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The outdoor rowing setting adds an element of tranquility, enhancing the 'Soothing & Restorative' classification. The score for 'Flow & Rhythm' is slightly lower, as the description leans more towards relaxation and recovery rather than rhythm-driven movement. The absence of high intensity or structured protocols excludes spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined.'"
