  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of just over 10 minutes and the focus on 'fix your posture', the workout is expected to have low energy expenditure. The purpose is to enhance mobility, typically involving gentle stretches and body adjustments, resulting in low physical exertion. Hence, it strongly aligns with the Light effort difficulty (score: 0.85). While there may be minor elements that could slightly raise the heart rate, pushing it towards Moderate difficulty, this alignment is weak (score: 0.2).",
