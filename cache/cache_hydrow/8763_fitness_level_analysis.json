  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is 41 minutes and 14 seconds and involves consistent rowing, which suggests a higher energy expenditure than lighter, shorter activities. For users in poor physical shape, a prolonged rowing session can pose a moderate challenge and possibly a challenging effort due to the sustained activity level. Therefore, there's a strong alignment with Moderate effort, and a partial alignment with Challenging given the length and physical demand of rowing.",
