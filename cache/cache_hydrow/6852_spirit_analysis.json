  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's name \"Technique Cool-Down\" and \"cool down\" in the workout type indicate a focus on relaxation and recovery, strongly aligning with the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit. The clear emphasis on alternating rowing and pausing supports this spirit, as it suggests a slower pace intended for winding down.\n\nThe format includes a max rhythm of 22 and music playlists like 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits,' indicating an element of \"Flow & Rhythm\" by using music to maintain a gentle, continuous movement. This is supported by the 0.6 score, reflecting the moderate rhythmic component present in the music and rowing intervals.\n\nThe outdoor setting shown in the image suggests a connection with nature, contributing to an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. The workout being on a river enhances this classification and justifies the 0.6 score, due to the environmental connection. Other spirits such as \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Sport & Agility\" were excluded, as there are no indicators of high intensity or sports performance focus. The scores reflect the primary focus on soothing, rhythmic, and mildly adventurous elements in the workout."
