Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The circuit is 10 minutes and 45 seconds long, which aligns with low-to-medium energy expenditure typical of short circuit formats. Although the description suggests a workout intensity to \"feel the burn,\" the limitation of time restricts maximal effort output, supporting a moderate effort level. The absence of extended duration or high-intensity elements typical of challenging workouts solidifies this classification, making it suitable for deconditioned users.",
