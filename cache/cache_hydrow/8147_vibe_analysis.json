  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Beginner Core Pilates' indicates a focus on technique and skill-building, typical of a 'Masterclass Workout,' as Pilates is inherently technique-driven. The emphasis on 'beginner' signals a methodical approach to learning, matching the 'Masterclass' vibe. The score of 0.7 reflects this strong connection to skill-building and controlled movement. Additionally, Pilates often provides a refreshing and low-stress workout, aligning with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which suggests a total-body refresh and gentle movement. The playlist with calming and reflective songs like 'Landslide' and 'Patience' supports a rejuvenating experience. However, the absence of stress or high intensity means 'The Warrior Workout' or similar high-energy vibes are not applicable. The vibes confidence is 0.7, given the strong alignment in technique and relaxation elements."
