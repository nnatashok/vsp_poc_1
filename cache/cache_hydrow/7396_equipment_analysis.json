  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'On The Mat,' strongly implying the use of a mat, which is essential for floor-based exercises. The image also shows the instructor standing on what appears to be a mat, reinforcing its necessity for the workout. The description and metadata do not mention any other equipment explicitly, supporting that the mat is likely the primary requirement for this beginner-focused, whole body strength workout."
