  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Wildlife Facts Row,' and involves rowing in 'wild waters of Alaska' which suggests an exploratory and rhythmic nature suitable for 'The Explorer's Workout'. The description \"climb in rhythm\" and the 'breathe' format imply a steady, focused activity, aligning with 'The Meditative Grind'. Additionally, the use of \"Dance Mid, Global Hits\" and tracks from upbeat artists indicates a lively musical backdrop, fitting 'The Groove Session'. The low intensity level (1 out of 3) and moderate pace support a more relaxed, immersive experience. These elements together paint a picture of exploration, rhythm, and groove."
