  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is labeled \"High Energy HIIT Row\" and described as consisting of 45-second intervals with a max rhythm of 34, indicating a fast-paced, intense session. The intensity level is 3 out of 3, further supporting the classification as \"High-Energy & Intense\" with a very strong match score of 0.9. The inclusion of 80's and Global Hits music also suggests a lively, energetic environment typical for intense workouts.\n\nAdditionally, the session takes place along the Vltava River in Prague, an open-air, natural setting, which aligns with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. Since the video is of a real rowing session on a river, this classification fits well, receiving a score of 0.8.\n\nAlthough the structured nature of HIIT could suggest a \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit, the emphasis on high energy and the outdoor setting did not warrant a strong classification in that category. Therefore, it was not included among the primary spirits for this workout."
