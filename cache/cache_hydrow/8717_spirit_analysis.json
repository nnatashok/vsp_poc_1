  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as \"High-Energy & Intense\" due to the focus on power and high-intensity intervals, explicitly stated in the description. The interval training format also suggests a session designed for pushing physical limits, supporting a high score of 0.9. The maximum rhythm of 34 and a workout intensity level of 3 out of 3 further emphasize the vigorous nature of the workout. The playlist includes upbeat and dynamic songs like 'We Are Young' and 'Are You Gonna Be My Girl,' aligning well with an intense workout atmosphere.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is also prominently featured, given the rowing activity is conducted on water, as evidenced by the image showing the session taking place in a boat on a river. This environment naturally brings in exploration and nature-based elements, justifying a score of 0.85. The presence of a real outdoor setting, captured in the image, strongly supports this classification. Other spirits are excluded due to lack of evidence suggesting a focus on flow, structure, or restoration."
