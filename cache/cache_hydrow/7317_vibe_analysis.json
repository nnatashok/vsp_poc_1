  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, \"Lower Body Strength with Bands,\" primarily fits The Masterclass Workout vibe, with a score of 0.7. This is due to its focus on building strength with specific equipment (resistance bands), pointing to a technique-driven and focused session. The workout is short, which aligns with structured, skill-building endeavors. \n\nAdditionally, The Rhythmic Powerhouse vibe is relevant, scored at 0.6, given the music selection with upbeat dance tracks and global hits that offer a beat-driven experience during the exercises, fostering a strong and fluid rhythm.\n\nThe Disciplined Grind vibe also applies, scoring 0.5, as the workout consists of standard strength exercises performed on the mat, emphasizing execution without distractions.\n\nOther vibes were excluded due to lack of high-intensity elements or gamified experiences typically associated with them, and no explicit mentions of meditation or relaxation typical of more calming vibes."
