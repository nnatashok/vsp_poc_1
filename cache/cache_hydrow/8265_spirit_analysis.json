  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title 'Vltava River Bow View' and the description 'Take in the historic sites of downtown Prague along the Vltava River' strongly indicate an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The mention of a specific river, along with the journey through historic sites, suggests a rowing workout conducted in a natural outdoor setting, aligning perfectly with the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. Hence, a score of 0.9 is assigned due to this strong thematic alignment. \n\nMoreover, the 'Workout Type: journey' implies a continuous, flowing experience, which aligns somewhat with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. Although less explicit than the outdoor element, the journey aspect suggests a rhythmical experience aligned with the scenic flow of the river, earning it a score of 0.6. \n\nGiven the nature-focused and continuous rowing elements, other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are less relevant due to the workout's emphasis on scenery and calm exploration rather than intense athleticism or technical precision."
