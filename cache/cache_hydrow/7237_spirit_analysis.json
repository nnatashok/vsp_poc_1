  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified predominantly as \"High-Energy & Intense\" due to multiple indicators of intensity and effort. The description specifies that participants should perform 'at your max effort,' aiming for a 'Max rhythm: 38+,' which is aligned with intense, fast-paced training. Additionally, the 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3' and song selection, such as 'Kick Out The Epic Motherf**ker' by Dada Life, which typically features high-energy dance music, further supports this classification with a score of 0.9.\n\n\"Outdoor & Adventure\" is also selected given the image depicting rowing on a river. This setting introduces an element of nature and exploration, contributing an outdoor spirit, even though the core focus is high intensity. The absence of music and direct references to this spirit somewhat reduces the score to 0.7.\n\nOther spirits like \"Flow & Rhythm\" or \"Soothing & Restorative\" do not apply due to the evident focus on maximum effort and power rather than relaxation or smooth, rhythmic movement."
