  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized by the need to maintain a consistent split and rhythm, aligning closely with 'The Meditative Grind' due to the repetitive and focused nature of rowing. This alignment is strengthened by the interval format and the emphasis on pacing (Score: 0.7). The music selection, which includes pop and global hits remixes, suggests a steady yet enjoyable pace, lending a secondary vibe of 'The Endorphin Wave,' reflecting an elevated and feel-good energy suitable for endurance rowing (Score: 0.6). Although not primarily dance-oriented, the presence of remixed tracks adds a mild element of fun and fluidity, slightly introducing 'The Groove Session' vibe (Score: 0.3). The absence of specific aggressive or high-intensity elements excludes vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' and 'The Firestarter.' Overall, the integration of rhythmic music and endurance-focused rowing supports a confident classification of these vibes."
