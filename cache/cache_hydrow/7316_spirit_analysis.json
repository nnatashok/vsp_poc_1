  "spiritsExplanation": "The presence of outdoor rowing imagery in a natural setting strongly supports the classification of this workout under 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a very high confidence level of 0.9. The exercise takes place on a river, emphasizing the adventure and exploration aspect of being outdoors. \n\nAdditionally, the workout description 'Focus on establishing power at lower rhythms' and the format being 'Interval' indicates a methodical and precise approach, aligning it with 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The term 'watts-focused session' suggests a technical emphasis on power output, typical of structured training, justifying a high score of 0.7 for this spirit.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Flow & Rhythm' spirits were considered but not selected, as the focus on lower rhythms and structure outweighs indicators of a fast-paced or fluid session."
