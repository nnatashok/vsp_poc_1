  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Unleashed Row\" signifies intensity and energy, supported by the description mentioning 'hero moment' and 'four 5-minute intervals'. The use of 'drive' and 'max rhythm: 30' further suggests a vigorous, fast-paced session. The category 'Drive,standard,row' aligns with a structured format but emphasizes intensity due to the workout type and intensity level '3 out of 3'. The playlist, featuring songs like 'Superheroes', 'Enemy', and high-energy pop tracks, supports an intense atmosphere, validating a strong match for 'High-Energy & Intense' (score: 0.8).\n\nThe image indicates the workout occurs on a river, fitting \"Outdoor & Adventure\" perfectly. Presence in nature, combined with the rowing activity, highlights the adventure aspect of the workout. Thus, this spirit receives a very strong score (0.9). These elements confirm the high confidence level in the analysis (0.95). Other spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are less applicable due to the focus on intensity and outdoor setting."
