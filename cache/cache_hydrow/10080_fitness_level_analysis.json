  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout category 'row', the technique difficulty is inherently capped at Beginner or Intermediate. The description 'One Stroke at a Time Row' suggests a focus on simplicity and mindfulness, aligning closely with Beginner. The presence of rhythm and a medium-level instructor might introduce slight complexity, suggesting a modest fit for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 21-minute duration combined with a low intensity level of 1 out of 3 indicates a workout that is primarily Light. The 'breathe' format implies a calming, low-energy expenditure routine. However, rowing can generally require moderate effort for beginners, thus the weaker Moderate rating.",
