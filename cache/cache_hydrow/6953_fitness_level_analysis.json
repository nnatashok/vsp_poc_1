  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 5-minute journey down Indian Creek, implying a relaxed pace more focused on experience than physical exertion. The short duration and absence of intensity indicators suggest that it is designed to be light and accessible, especially suited for those who are less fit. However, rowing generally requires some energy expenditure, which could imply a low to moderate effort for beginners, leading to a slight moderate score. Overall, it aligns strongly with the Light effort category while maintaining a potential but weaker fit for Moderate.",
