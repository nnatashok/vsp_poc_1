  "vibesExplanation": "The main elements of this workout suggest it belongs to 'The Meditative Grind' and partly to 'The Reboot Workout'. The title 'Feel Rhythm 22 Cool-Down' and description emphasize maintaining a steady rhythm, which fits the repetitive and meditative qualities of 'The Meditative Grind', hence a score of 0.75. The use of a low-intensity pace (rhythm 22) and the 'cool down' classification support this.\n\nGiven that this workout is described as a cool-down, it also aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which is about low-stress total-body refreshment. The calming nature of the songs like 'Easy' by Faith No More adds to the comforting and rejuvenating vibe, justifying a score of 0.65.\n\nThe exclusion of intense vibes like 'The Adrenaline Rush' is due to the workout's steady and low-intensity format."
