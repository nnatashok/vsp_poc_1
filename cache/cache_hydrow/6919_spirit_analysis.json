  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Feel Rhythm 22 Cool-Down' emphasizes maintaining a rhythm of 22, indicating a focus on pacing and smooth movement, aligning with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The term 'cool down' and the playlist including calming songs like 'Tuesday's Gone' suggest a relaxing environment, fitting the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. Additionally, the image shows the workout conducted on water, which along with the outdoors theme aligns it with 'Outdoor & Adventure'. The use of music specifically from rock radio stations may add a relaxed yet rhythmic energy, reinforcing both 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative'. The confidence level for these spirits is high due to explicit cues in the name, description, and setting."
