  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout name 'Steady Cool-Down' and the description suggest this is a rowing session, as it takes place 'along the Charles River.' The category 'row' explicitly indicates the need for rowing equipment. The image also shows a person rowing on the water, often associated with using a rowing machine for similar indoor workouts. Thus, a rowing machine is necessary with very high confidence, scoring 0.9 on the confidence scale."
