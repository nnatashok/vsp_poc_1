  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Core Strength' has a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, evident from the outdoor setting on a dock by the water, as seen in the image. This natural, outdoor environment aligns well with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The spirit is assigned a high score of 0.85 due to the location's prominence in the workout.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also present, with a score of 0.6, as the workout focuses on core strength training, which typically involves methodical and focused exercises. The mention of a specific fitness goal (core strength) supports this classification.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit receives a moderate score of 0.4, due to the inclusion of 80s music in the workout, providing a rhythmic background to the exercise routine. However, since the primary focus is strength, this is less dominant. The music and pace contribute to a sense of movement, but are secondary to the structured strength component. \n\nOverall, these spirits suit the workout's structure and setting, with the outdoor element being particularly influential."
