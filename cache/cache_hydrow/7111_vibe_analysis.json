  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Fitness Conditioning Row' features HIIT and intense 20-stroke intervals, clearly aligning it with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe, suggesting a sweat-dripping, heart-pounding experience. The use of an 80s and 90s rock playlist supports this vibe, creating an energetic environment well-suited to high-intensity conditioning. Therefore, a score of 0.75 is given for this vibe. Additionally, the rowing element, specified intensity, and duration allow for 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, characterized by zoning in through repetitive motion; this justifies a score of 0.6. The repetitive nature and inclusion of steady rock tracks also support the 'Endorphin Wave' vibe, albeit less prominently, leading to a score of 0.5. There is high confidence in this analysis given the explicit metadata."
