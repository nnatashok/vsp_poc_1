  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'On The Mat,' which strongly suggests the use of a mat for core exercises. This assumption is further supported by the image, which shows a mat being used. The confidence score is very high (0.95) because the mat is explicitly referenced as part of the workout environment and essential for comfort and support during floor exercises in a core strength workout."
