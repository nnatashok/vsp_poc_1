  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's name 'Energizing Endurance Row' and classification under the 'row' category indicate that a rowing machine is required. Additionally, the description mentions building speed, power, and endurance, which are typical objectives for a rowing workout. The mention of rowing through downtown Seville further implies the use of a rowing machine in a simulated environment. The high confidence score (1) is justified since the category is explicitly 'row', requiring a rowing machine for this workout."
