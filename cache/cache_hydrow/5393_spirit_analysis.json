  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Yoga for Cyclists' predominantly embodies the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, as it involves a yoga session described as involving 'flowing together' and is likely centered on smooth, continuous movements. The playlist's downtempo and chill music supports this classification, suggesting a music-driven and coordinated session. The score of 0.85 reflects strong evidence due to the specific mention of 'flow' in the workout type. \n\nAdditionally, the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is prominent, as the session focuses on 'releasing tension' after cycling, targeting recovery and relaxation post-exercise. This is further reinforced by the music genres of 'Chill' and 'Cool/Downtempo,' and a score of 0.8 is assigned due to these restorative themes. \n\nFinally, the image indicates an outdoor setting, which supports the 'Outdoor & Adventure' categorization. The presence of nature and greenery in the exercise environment justifies this spirit, albeit with a slightly lower score of 0.75, as the primary focus is not on adventure itself but on the restorative and flow aspects within a natural setting. Other spirits were excluded due to a lack of indicators of intensity, specific sports skills, or strict structured elements."
