  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Whole Body Repeats Circuit' suggests a high-energy and intense workout, as indicated by the full body focus and interval format involving 1 and 2-minute repeats. The title 'circuit' along with elements like maximum rhythm of 26 and explicit lyrics in the hip-hop/R&B playlist support an energetic and dynamic atmosphere. The use of music like 'Check Yo Self (Remix)' and 'Bring The Pain' further enhances the intense vibe for this session, justifying a score of 0.9 for High-Energy & Intense. \n\nThe structure is also disciplined, as the workout description and the EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute) format indicate a methodical and scheduled approach to training, especially with explicit time intervals on and off the Hydrow. This organized format supports a Structured & Disciplined spirit classification with a score of 0.7. \n\nThe lack of indicators for relaxation or outdoor elements excludes spirits like Soothing & Restorative or Outdoor & Adventure."
