  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'Drive', which according to Hydrow-specific rules, tends to be classified as Advanced due to its technical demands in rowing technique. The 'HIIT-style' also suggests a need for precise interval execution, accentuating the Advanced classification. The user fitness level requirement is Advanced, reinforcing that the technique requires substantial aptitude and precision beyond basic rowing competencies.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short at 11:23, which aligns well with an intense effort typical of HIIT workouts. The max rhythm of 30 strokes per minute, coupled with a high intensity level of 3 out of 3, indicates a demanding workout. Although 'Drive' may suggest advanced calorie burning, the short duration limits overall energy expenditure, positioning the effort as primarily Challenging, with a possible lean toward Extreme due to high intensity.",
