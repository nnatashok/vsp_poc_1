  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout '10-Stroke Builders Warm-Up' embodies the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit due to its organized approach, as suggested by the focus on 'ten stroke builders' and maintaining a 'steady rhythm.' This indicates a methodical, progressive training method aimed at building power and energy, which aligns well with structured approaches. The score of 0.7 reflects this clear alignment. \n\nFurthermore, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is prominent, as the workout is conducted on water, depicted in the image with rowers on a river or canal. This setting naturally aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification. The use of outdoor environments for rowing heavily suggests exploration and environmental engagement, earning it a score of 0.8. \n\nThe presence of energetic and internationally popular music ('DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love' and 'Miles Apart') supports a lively yet controlled session, hence not fully aligning with 'High-Energy & Intense.' It's more about setting an energizing atmosphere than pushing physical limits, which further justifies the chosen spirits."
