  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is labeled under the 'row' category, which strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine as the primary equipment. This is further supported by the title 'Nord\u00e5svannet Bay Bow View' and the description which mentions 'flat water,' both of which are indicative of a rowing activity. The structure of the workout as a 'journey' and its categorization under 'Journeys,standard,row' reinforces the requirement of a rowing machine, as these are typical characteristics of virtual rowing experiences. Given the very specific alignment with rowing terminology and categorization, the confidence score for requiring a rowing machine is very high, at 1.0."
