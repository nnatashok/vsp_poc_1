  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is primarily classified as Advanced due to the workout type 'Drive', which on Hydrow is associated with complex, technical rowing movements. The reference to 'in-depth technical detail' and the high rhythm pace indicates a significant level of coordination and skill required to maintain proper form, aligning strongly with Advanced level. However, there is a moderate alignment with Intermediate, considering rowing workouts can somewhat align with less complex movement if not for the 'Drive' specification.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as Challenging due to the high workout intensity level (3 out of 3) and the extended duration (21:32), both indicative of demanding physical exertion. The description of 'maximum pace' and 'high-energy' workouts further supports this classification. There is also a significant alignment with Extreme level given the potential difficulty for less fit users to sustain a rhythm of 32 and the intensity level described, though not enough to surpass the Challenging classification entirely.",
