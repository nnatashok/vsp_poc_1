  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled \"Relaxation Restore\" emphasizes stillness and finding peace in both body and mind, highly indicative of 'The Zen Flow' vibe. This is reinforced by terms like 'stillness' and 'laying on your back,' suggesting a slow, intentional practice. The recommendation for yoga blocks also aligns with a grounding and breath-centered approach. The use of chill, downtempo music further enhances this vibe, promoting a calming environment. \n\nAdditionally, the brief duration (11 minutes) and restorative nature of the workout suggest it serves as a 'Deep Recharge,' providing a gentle movement and nervous system reset. However, since the primary focus seems to be on calmness and intentional flow, 'The Zen Flow' is assigned a slightly higher score. The absence of high-intensity elements or dynamic music excludes other more vigorous or upbeat vibes."
