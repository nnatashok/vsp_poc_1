  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata indicates that the workout is a 'row' type, which implies the use of a rowing machine as it explicitly states 'Category: row'. The description involves increasing rhythm and intensity, typical elements of a rowing machine workout. The workout image also visually confirms the use of rowing equipment. Therefore, the confidence level for a rowing machine being required is very high, at 1.0."
