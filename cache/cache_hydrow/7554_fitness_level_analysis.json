Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is relatively short at just over 10 minutes, and as a cool-down, it doesn't include high-intensity rowing. Cool-downs are generally designed to gradually reduce heart rate and relax muscles post-exercise. The focus is on reinforcing technique rather than exerting energy, strongly supporting a classification of 'Light' effort difficulty. There is no indication of high energy expenditure exercises, and the session's instructor and format indicate a mild exertion level, hence the almost certain light classification.",
