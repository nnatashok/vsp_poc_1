  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Pop Row' is primarily classified as High-Energy & Intense, with a score of 0.9. This is due to the description detailing 'sprint pace for 90-second intervals' and '30-second push at max pace,' both of which indicate a high intensity level. Furthermore, the music playlist featuring energetic pop hits from artists like Lady Gaga, Avicii, and Kesha supports this high-energy atmosphere. The workout intensity is rated 3 out of 3, further confirming the intense nature.\n\nThe secondary classification is Outdoor & Adventure, with a score of 0.7, as the workout takes place on a river, as seen in the image, which aligns with the criteria for outdoor-based workouts. \n\nFlow & Rhythm was considered due to the music-driven approach but was not selected due to the focus on sprint intervals rather than continuous movement. Therefore, it was given a lower relevance compared to High-Energy & Intense."
