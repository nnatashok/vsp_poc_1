  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is characterized by alternating rhythms between low and high, implying a focus on transition and coordination, which aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The use of 'rhythms' and the inclusion of 90s music support the emphasis on musical pacing, justifying a high score of 0.9 for this spirit. Additionally, the image suggests the workout is conducted on a river, indicating an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This environment adds an exploration element, with a supporting score of 0.7 due to the nature-based workout setting. The interval format and low intensity level do not strongly connect with other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined.' Therefore, those were not selected."
