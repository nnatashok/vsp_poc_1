  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to its HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) style, as noted in the title and description ('Get your heart rate up'), which indicates a focus on high effort and cardiovascular demand. The music playlist features energetic tracks (from artists like Martin Garrix and David Guetta), further enhancing the intense and upbeat atmosphere suitable for a high-energy workout. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong alignment with this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the workout was performed in an outdoor setting, as seen in the image, with natural scenery forming the backdrop. This setting suggests the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, since it utilizes natural elements, providing a scenic and adventurous exercise experience. The association with this spirit is assigned a score of 0.8 due to the clear visual context.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the vigorous and structured nature of HIIT, which does not typically emphasize smooth, continuous movement or relaxation."
