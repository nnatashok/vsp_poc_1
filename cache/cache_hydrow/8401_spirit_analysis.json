  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Sandwich Row' emphasizes 'power and speed' with a 'rhythm' shift, indicating a mix of high-energy and rhythmic flow. The 'intensity level' of 2 out of 3 suggests a challenging yet manageable session. The music selection, featuring energetic indie and alternative hits, supports high-energy engagement. The image further supports an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, as the rowing takes place in a natural setting on a river, a defining factor for this spirit. The overall high-energy intent, expressed through interval training noted in the metadata, strongly correlates with 'High-Energy & Intense' activities. The mention of transitioning between rhythms also provides grounds for a 'Flow & Rhythm' classification, though with less emphasis since the intensity and outdoor setting take precedence. Each spirit aligns with the workout\u2019s structure and environment, with 'Outdoor & Adventure' being the most distinct due to the rowing setting."
