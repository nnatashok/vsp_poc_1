  "vibesExplanation": "The \"Endurance Pyramid Row\" workout is categorized under 'Breathe' and 'Standard', indicating a sustained, rhythmic effort that's typical of 'The Meditative Grind'. The 16-minute duration aligns with a consistent, focused experience where repetition can take over. The maximum rhythm of 24 also emphasizes a steady, controlled pace. The music playlist includes pop hits like Sheryl Crow's 'Soak Up The Sun' and Maroon 5's 'She Will Be Loved', which suggests a positive and uplifting ambiance. This aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave', as the feel-good nature of the music supports a steady build of energy. The low intensity level further corroborates a more meditative, endurance-focused vibe rather than high intensity. The lack of explicit competitive or high-intensity elements excludes other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.' Hence, 'The Meditative Grind' and 'The Endorphin Wave' are suitable classifications."
