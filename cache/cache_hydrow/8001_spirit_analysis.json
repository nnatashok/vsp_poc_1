  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'All in One Row' incorporates elements of 'Flow & Rhythm' with music-driven pacing and an emphasis on continuous movement, as seen in the 'Club 26 style row' and the dance and global hits soundtrack. This is further reinforced by the playlist including several rhythmic tracks by Underworld. The spirit 'High-Energy & Intense' is applicable due to the 'sweat' category, 'interval format,' and moderate to high-intensity level (2 out of 3), indicating a vigorous workout. Lastly, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is a relevant spirit due to the image showing rowing on a river, aligning with the classification guidelines for outdoor rowing sessions. The combination of these spirits highlights a dynamic and immersive rowing experience with a strong emphasis on rhythm, energy, and outdoor exploration."
