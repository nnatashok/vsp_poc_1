  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.7 due to its circuit-style Pilates exercises, which emphasize smooth, continuous movements and coordination. The title \"Whole Body Pilates\" suggests a balanced mind-body approach, supported by rhythmic dance and global hit music that drives the pacing.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is scored at 0.8, with high confidence, due to the workout being conducted in an outdoor location at Echo Park Lake in Los Angeles. The natural scenery enhances the adventurous and exploratory aspect of the session. The fact that it is conducted in a scenic, outdoor environment strongly indicates this spirit.\n\nThere is less emphasis on high-intensity, structured training, or restorative elements, making these spirits less relevant."
