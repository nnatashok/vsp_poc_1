  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Hip-Opening Flow,\" with the description emphasizing movement with breath and the presence of flowing sequences. This indicates a strong \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit. The term 'flow' suggests smooth, continuous movements linking breath and action, which is supported by the downtempo and chill music that further enhances the rhythmic aspect. This spirit is scored at 0.9 due to explicit use of 'flow' and the music choice that complements it.\n\nAdditionally, the workout takes place \"overlooking the mountains in Norway,\" capturing the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. The natural setting and visual evidence from the image align with nature-based exploration qualities. This spirit is assigned a score of 0.8, reflecting the significant role of the outdoor environment in framing the session.\n\nOther spirits like \"Soothing & Restorative\" could be relevant due to the gentle nature of hip-opening flows; however, the explicit emphasis on flow and outdoor elements are more prominent."
