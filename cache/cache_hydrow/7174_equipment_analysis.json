  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'De-Stress Restorative Yoga,' which typically involves floor-based exercises that require a mat for comfort and support. The category is 'On The Mat,' which strongly indicates the use of a yoga or exercise mat, yielding a very high confidence score of 0.9. There is no mention of other equipment in the description, and restorative yoga generally focuses on relaxation, making additional equipment unlikely to be essential. Therefore, the only required equipment identified is a mat."
