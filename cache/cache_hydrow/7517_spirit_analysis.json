  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Running + Sprinting Pace Row' involves intervals, a format often designed to increase heart rate and endurance, suggesting a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The level of intensity is marked as 2 out of 3, and the categorization as 'sweat' further supports this classification, receiving a strong score of 0.7 due to these factors.\n\nThe image provided shows the workout taking place on a river, aligning it with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This setting significantly influences the classification, as rowing in a natural environment enhances the adventurous feel, leading to a score of 0.8.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is suggested by the emphasis on music from Shrek movies, and a max rhythm designation of 28. The workout involves music-driven pacing with pop and global hits, which encourages a connected and rhythmic movement experience. Therefore, it fits this spirit moderately well, scoring 0.6.\n\nOther spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are not supported by the interval format and high-intensity categorization, as the focus is on effort and energy rather than precision or relaxation."
