  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', and according to the Hydrow-specific classification, this should be considered at the Beginner or Intermediate Technique Difficulty level. The description does not suggest any complex movements or technical rowing elements that would elevate the difficulty beyond these levels. Therefore, there is strong alignment with Beginner, with some potential for Intermediate due to the inclusion of interval training, which could require slightly more coordination.",

This aligns with Light effort difficulty. However, the duration of over 21 minutes and the format labeled as 'Climb' which involves intervals could increase the effort required. Therefore, there is moderate alignment with Moderate difficulty as well.",
