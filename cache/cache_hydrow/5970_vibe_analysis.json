  "vibesExplanation": "The workout's focus on unwinding and its categorization as a 'Cool Down' imply a strong match to 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which is about refreshing and gently moving the body. The description mentions a 'steady cool down,' and with a rhythmic focus and serene location ('along the Charles River'), 'The Zen Flow' is a suitable vibe, supported by the world music and global hits likely providing a soothing background, earning both vibes a strong score. The steady rhythm and repetitive nature of rowing fit 'The Meditative Grind,' albeit slightly less directly than the other two vibes, resulting in a moderate score. Music by Maggie Rogers, known for a calming yet rhythmic style, reinforces a tranquil and steady experience."
