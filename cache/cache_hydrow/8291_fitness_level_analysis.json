  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout 'Chicago Bridges Row' fits the Beginner technique difficulty primarily because it involves a standard rowing activity, which is generally straightforward and doesn't require complex movement patterns. The presence of a professional instructor with impressive credentials likely emphasizes technique, ensuring proper form even for beginners, hence slight alignment with Intermediate complexity. However, rowing itself, as indicated by the Category 'breathe,standard,row,' is simple enough for a Beginner rating to dominate.",
