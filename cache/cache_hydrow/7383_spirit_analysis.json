  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to several factors: the description specifies intervals of 'sprint and max pace' and the intensity level is rated at 3 out of 3, indicating a demanding and vigorous session. The use of HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) format further supports this classification, as HIIT is known for its high energy and intensity.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant. The image associated with the metadata shows rowing on a river, which aligns with the outdoor setting and adventure aspect. This suggests that the physical environment plays a significant role in the workout experience.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' receives a moderate score due to the presence of music (Hip Hop/R&B High, Global Hits) that could potentially drive rhythm and coordination during the rowing workout. However, it is not a primary focus given the emphasis on intervals and intensity.\n\nOther spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined,' 'Soothing & Restorative,' and 'Sport & Agility' were considered less fitting given the lack of emphasis on training protocols, recovery focus, or sports-specific skills."
