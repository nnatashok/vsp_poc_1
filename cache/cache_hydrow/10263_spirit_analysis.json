  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Glute and Core Burner Circuit' emphasizes a structured approach due to its circuit format, which inherently involves sequential, organized activities targeting specific muscle groups such as glutes and core. This aligns with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, scoring 0.8 due to the methodical emphasis on strength training exercises. Additionally, the mention of 'Max rhythm: 30' and the use of music genres such as 'Rock Mid-intensity' suggests a rhythmic aspect, justifying a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a score of 0.6. The workout is categorized as 'On The Mat,' excluding the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The moderately intense music and absence of extreme effort cues make 'High-Energy & Intense' less applicable."
