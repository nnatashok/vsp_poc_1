  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Vancouver HIIT Row,' combines elements of high intensity and outdoor scenery. The use of 'HIIT' (High-Intensity Interval Training) in the title and a maximum rhythm of 32, combined with the intensity level set at 3 out of 3, clearly indicate a high-energy and intense spirit. The inclusion of songs with dynamic genres, such as those by Avicii and BlackPink, further supports this high-energy classification, contributing to a score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the workout description mentions a tour of Vancouver and the accompanying image shows rowing on a river, suggesting an Outdoor & Adventure element. This aspect aligns with the requirement for Outdoor & Adventure classification due to the environmental and explorative context, leading to a score of 0.8.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were considered but excluded due to the high-paced and intense nature of the workout."
