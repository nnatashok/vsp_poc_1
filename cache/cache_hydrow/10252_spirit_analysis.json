  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Summer Fun Row' is characterized by upbeat energy and fun vibes, which suggests a strong element of Flow & Rhythm. The use of terms such as 'varying rhythms' and references to beach races implies a coordination with music or rhythm, justified by the music genres like '00s Hits' and 'Global Hits'. Therefore, a Flow & Rhythm spirit is assigned with a score of 0.7, reflecting the workout's integration of rhythm and continuous movement, despite the structured intervals.\n\nThe workout's description also includes 'two 4-minute intervals,' which demonstrates a methodical approach, aligning with the Structured & Disciplined spirit. A score of 0.6 reflects the clear interval training structure, indicating progressive training and technical precision, even if the overall intensity level is beginner-friendly.\n\nWhile the intensity level is low (1 out of 3), indicating it's not primarily High-Energy & Intense, the upbeat energy, and the presence of intervals support a minor association with this spirit, earning a score of 0.5, acknowledging the influence of the instructor's high-energy description. The Outdoor & Adventure spirit is excluded due to the lack of natural or outdoor setting mentions."
