  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled 'Chicago Cool-Down' with the description, \"Refine your technique with Mike as you row steadily down the Chicago River,\" indicates a technique-focused rowing session. The category includes 'row', which firmly establishes the central role of a Rowing machine in this workout. Additionally, the instructor, Mike Dostal, is emphasized as an experienced rower, reinforcing that this session is designed to improve rowing ability. As such, using a Rowing machine is undoubtedly required, and the confidence level is set to 1.0 due to the explicit mention of rowing and the format of the workout tailored for rowing technique refinement. No other equipment is mentioned or implied as necessary."
