  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Yoga Align for the Spine' is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.9. This is based on the title and description, which emphasize 'stability,' 'stillness,' and 'release tension,' indicating a gentle and recovery-focused session. The activity of aligning and lengthening the spine further supports the focus on relaxation and restoration.\n\nAdditionally, the session is classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.7. The image of instructors performing the yoga session outside by the water, in a natural setting, enhances the adventure aspect by taking advantage of the outdoor environment. The music genre, described as 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo,' complements the soothing nature of the workout.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' or 'High-Energy & Intense' were excluded due to the lack of fast-paced or music-driven movement indicators. 'Structured & Disciplined' was not chosen because the emphasis is more on gentle alignment rather than technical precision or progression. The overall confidence in these classifications is high."
