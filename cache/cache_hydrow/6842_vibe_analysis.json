  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of this workout is 'The Reboot Workout' with high confidence (0.9) because it's described as a 'cool-down' which emphasizes a 'mood-boosting' and refreshing effect. The music choices, like 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' and 'Hey, Soul Sister,' support this relaxing, feel-good environment. \n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Endorphin Wave' with moderate confidence (0.6). Although it's a low-intensity session, the upbeat music and 'feel good' description suggest an elevated, positive energy that's typical of an endorphin-boosting experience.\n\nFinally, 'The Comfort Moves' is included with moderate confidence (0.5) due to the gentle, safe aspects of cooling down featuring comforting and familiar music. \n\nOther vibes were excluded as the focus here is on relaxation and post-workout recovery rather than intense physical exertion or competition."
