  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Climbing Cardio Row,\" and is categorized under 'row,' which strongly indicates the need for a rowing machine. The term \"row\" in both the title and category suggests that rowing is the central activity of this workout. The image associated with the metadata shows a person using a rowing boat, reinforcing the association with rowing activity, although a rowing machine is the typical equipment for an indoor workout. Hence, the confidence level is set at 0.9, as the workout heavily centers around rowing activity without explicit mention of an indoor rowing machine."
