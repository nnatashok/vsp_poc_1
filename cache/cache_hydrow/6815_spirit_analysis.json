  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Self Reflection Cool-Down' is primarily characterized by a Soothing & Restorative spirit, with a score of 0.8. The description emphasizes acceptance, appreciation, and a focus on both mind and body, which aligns with the qualities of gentle, recovery-focused sessions. Additionally, the mention of a 'cool-down' reinforces the restorative element.\n\nFlow & Rhythm is also a relevant spirit, with a score of 0.5. The steady format and music choices such as 'Happier' and 'Friends' by Marshmello contribute to a rhythmic experience, although less dominantly than the restorative aspect.\n\nThe Outdoor & Adventure spirit receives a score of 0.4. Although the setting is on a river and includes a visual of rowing, indicating an outdoor environment, the focus remains on cooling down and introspection rather than exploration or environmental challenge. This slightly supports the adventure aspect but is secondary to the other spirits."
