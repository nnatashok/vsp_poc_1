  "vibesExplanation": "The workout focuses on cardio intervals with a low intensity level of 1 out of 3, which indicates a controlled and mindful approach, aligning with both 'The Meditative Grind' and 'The Zen Flow'. The use of mainstream pop and global hits provides an uplifting but not overly intense background, complementing the rowing intervals with a rhythmic but calm energy. The focus on listening to one's body and breathing further suggests a more grounded and intentional workout. Given the short duration and gentle structure, the vibe is less aligned with higher intensity categories and more with a meditative or flowing nature. The description 'breathe' is an additional cue that emphasizes the conscious, breath-centered efforts typical of these vibes."
