  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Vltava River Bow View\" and described as a journey along the historic sites of downtown Prague on the Vltava River. This title and description strongly suggest an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit since it involves exploration and scenic rowing on a river. The category 'Journeys' further supports this classification as it implies an experiential and scenic nature of the workout. There is no indication of high energy or intensity, structured training, or a focus on soothing/restorative movements. Due to the clear outdoor environmental context and lack of other competing spirits, an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" classification fits best, with a high score of 0.95 based on explicit evidence. The confidence in this spirits assignment is high at 0.9, given the strong alignment with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" characteristics. Other spirits were excluded due to lack of relevant indicators."
