Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of only 5 minutes and described as a 'stretch out' session, the physical demand is minimal. The effort aligns strongly with a Light level, as short-duration Pilates sessions typically don't elevate heart rate significantly. The music choice of Chill and Downtempo also supports a less intense setting. The moderate alignment reflects potential core-focused work that might be challenging for some participants, but it's still primarily a low-intensity activity.",
