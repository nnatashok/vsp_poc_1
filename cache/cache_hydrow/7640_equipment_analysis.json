The description mentions power strokes between two-minute and three-minute intervals, indicating a rowing-focused workout. The workout type includes 'row' in the category, strongly suggesting the use of a rowing machine. The confidence score is set at 0.9 because the workout explicitly centers on rowing, and no other equipment is mentioned in the metadata or visible in the image provided, which shows an individual rowing.
