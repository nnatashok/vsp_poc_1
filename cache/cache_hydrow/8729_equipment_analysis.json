  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout name 'Change Your Narrative Row' and the category 'row' explicitly indicate that rowing is central to this workout. Additionally, the description mentions rowing through 'three pyramids with Aisyah,' reinforcing the need for rowing equipment. The image portrays a person on a single scull, which further aligns with rowing activities, although an indoor rowing machine would typically be used for such workouts. Despite no equipment being listed in the metadata, the context makes it clear that a rowing machine is required, justifying a very high confidence score of 0.9."
