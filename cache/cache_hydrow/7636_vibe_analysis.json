  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Weekly Conditioning Row' primarily fits 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its interval format and sprint pace focus. Intervals, particularly those characterized as '3-minute' and 'sprint pace', suggest fast, explosive, and short bursts of effort typical of a Firestarter workout. This is further supported by the reference to rhythm (max rhythm 26), which indicates a vigorous tempo.\n\n'The Competitor' vibe is also relevant, with a score of 0.7. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggests a challenging workout that could cater to those with a competitive spirit, especially as it's labeled under 'sweat' and assumes an intermediate fitness level, insinuating a demanding effort aligning with competitive energy.\n\n'The Meditative Grind' received a moderate score of 0.5 because the repeated intervals at a consistent rhythm level resonate with the concept of zoning in on repetitive tasks. However, the focus on sprint pace is less typical of the meditative vibe, hence the lower score compared to the primary vibes.\n\nThe lack of a specified music genre contributes to some uncertainty, balanced by the inclusion of indie and global hits, which don't significantly impact the primary vibes identified."
