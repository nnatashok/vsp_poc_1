  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which aligns with a Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty. Given the encouragement and detailed technical instruction offered by the instructor, coupled with the 'breathe' workout type (indicating a focus on form and consistency rather than complexity), this suggests a high conformity to Beginner-level techniques. The pyramid style suggests a progressive structure, slightly elevating complexity to Intermediate levels, but the overall rowing technique remains accessible for beginners, as suggested by the user fitness requirement.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 11:22 minutes and a maximum rhythm of 22 indicate a low-energy, steady-paced workout suitable for beginners. The 'breathe' format and level 1 intensity rating further emphasize a less demanding nature, aligning it with Light effort difficulty. However, the pyramid structure might introduce moderate exertion at some points, leading to a partial Moderate score.",
