The outdoor setting and the presence of natural beauty strongly align with this spirit, scoring 0.9. \"High-Energy & Intense\" is also applicable with a score of 0.8, as the workout involves 1-minute intervals and is tagged with the highest intensity level of 3 out of 3. This indicates a vigorous and challenging session. The music playlist includes upbeat songs, adding to the high-energy atmosphere. Finally, \"Flow & Rhythm\" is relevant with a score of 0.6 as the session likely involves maintaining rhythm with the music (Dance and Global Hits) while rowing, enhancing coordination and continuity. Other spirits like \"Soothing & Restorative\" and \"Structured & Disciplined\" are less relevant due to the workout's intensity and outdoor adventure context."
