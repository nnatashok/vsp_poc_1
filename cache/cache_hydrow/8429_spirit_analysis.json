  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Racing Mindset Row' with a description emphasizing 'ignite your legs and lungs' suggests a demanding and vigorous session, aligning closely with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The use of 'bolt down the Charles River' further reinforces the high energy and competitive nature typically seen in intense workouts, supporting a strong match with a score of 0.8.\n\nThe phrase 'bolt down the Charles River', combined with the image showing rowing in a river setting, indicates an outdoor location, aligning well with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This is especially relevant given the river setting and natural environment, justifying a high confidence score of 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nThe format being HIIT and the intensity level rated '3 out of 3' further correlate with high energy, reinforcing the choice of 'High-Energy & Intense'. The combination of these elements clearly presents a scenario that fits both the 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'High-Energy & Intense' spirits, with the former being slightly more dominant due to the outdoor setting."
