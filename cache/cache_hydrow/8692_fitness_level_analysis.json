  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute) format and duration over 10 minutes indicate a moderate to challenging effort level. EMOM formats are generally considered more intense due to the constant movement with little rest. However, the brief nature of the workout (10:39 duration) makes it less extreme, placing it between Moderate and Challenging. The involvement of dumbbells and the rowing component adds to the effort required, particularly for less fit individuals.",
