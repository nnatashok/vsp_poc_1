  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the use of 1-minute high-intensity interval training (HIIT) intervals and the workout intensity level of 3 out of 3, indicating maximum effort required. These are strong indicators of an intense workout, earning it a score of 0.9. Additionally, the music playlist featuring upbeat pop and global hits contributes to a high-energy atmosphere.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also a significant aspect due to the workout taking place on the river in Prague, as indicated by the title 'Welcome to Prague Row' and the image provided. The natural outdoor setting supports an adventurous experience, scored at 0.8. The picturesque Prague location enhances the adventurous quality by leveraging environmental elements, which aligns well with this spirit.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were considered but are less relevant as the emphasis here is more on intensity and outdoor exploration rather than smooth movement or structured progression."
