  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Our Common Thread Row' workout embodies a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit with a score of 0.9 due to its focus on 2 and 1-minute intervals, format described as 'drive,' and an intensity level of 3 out of 3, indicating a high-intensity pace. The music genres mentioned, Rock Mid-intensity and Global Hits, suggest an energetic atmosphere typical of intense workouts. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also present, scoring 0.7, as the workout involves planned intervals and rowing, which requires technique and precision. The use of interval formats aligns with a methodical approach, enhancing the structured nature of the session. The presence of family storytelling elements adds an engaging narrative but doesn't detract from the primary energetic and structured focus. There is no indication of outdoor or rhythm-based themes, leading to their exclusion."
