  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified predominantly as 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the imagery and description indicating the session takes place outdoors 'overlooking the hills of greater Dublin,' clearly aligning with natural, exploratory elements characteristic of this spirit. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong match with this spirit.\n\n'Glutes + Hip Strength with Mini Band' in the title signals a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit as well, focusing on specific muscle groups and using resistance band equipment, hinting at methodical progressions. This is supported by the workout's short, focused duration, earning it a score of 0.7.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of popular music tracks like 'Levitating' by Dua Lipa suggests a possible 'Flow & Rhythm' component, inferring some level of music-driven movement and engagement, though this is a minor aspect with a score of 0.4. Other spirits were excluded due to lack of recovery emphasis, extreme intensity, or sports-specificity."
