  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout description indicates a high-intensity session with \"10-stroke builders\" followed by a \"3-minute piece at max pace,\" which reflects the High-Energy & Intense spirit. The \"interval\" and \"Drive\" format, combined with a max rhythm of 32 strokes, suggest a brisk and challenging pace meant to push limits. The music playlist, featuring energetic pop and global hits, further supports this energetic classification.\n\nThe video imagery shows rowing on a river, classifying it within the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. This natural setting leverages environmental elements as part of the workout, consistent with the Outdoor & Adventure classification. Given these strong and explicit indicators, the workout earns high confidence scores in these categories, while other spirits like Flow & Rhythm or Structured & Disciplined are less applicable here due to the emphasis on intensity and outdoor setting."
