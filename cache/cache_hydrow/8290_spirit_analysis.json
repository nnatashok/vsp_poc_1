  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Vancouver Challenge Row,' strongly aligns with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The description highlights a race to accumulate as many meters as possible, indicating a fast-paced and challenging session. The intensity level is rated 3 out of 3, further supporting the high-energy classification. Music genres like Rock Mid-intensity and Global Hits, along with the explicit lyrics, suggest a powerful and motivating soundtrack, enhancing the intensity.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is a strong match, as the workout takes place outdoors in Vancouver. The image supports this with a clear outdoor setting on water, fitting the 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification. The term 'Challenge Row' also implies an adventurous aspect.\n\nOther spirits were considered less relevant due to the lack of restorative, structured protocol, or sports-specific training elements. The combination of intense pace and outdoor environment makes these two spirits predominant."
