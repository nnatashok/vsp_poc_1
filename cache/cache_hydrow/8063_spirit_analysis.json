  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout name 'Club 18 Row' and the description emphasize gaining power with each stroke during 'low rhythm intervals,' suggesting a focus on rhythm and technique, which aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The presence of 'low rhythm intervals' indicates a structured approach to pacing and consistency, justifying the association with 'Structured & Disciplined,' particularly as participants are guided to improve power with technique. The workout format and category labels 'power' and 'sweat' point to an organized effort to build strength and endurance systematically, further supporting this classification. The choice of Indie Alternative and Global Hits for music could help maintain a steady rhythm, adding to the 'Flow & Rhythm' elements. However, the emphasis on low rhythm, coaching, and structured intervals means 'Structured & Disciplined' is a more fitting primary classification here. The workout's intensity level of 2 out of 3 and focus on intermediate users suggests it is challenging but not excessively intense, ruling out 'High-Energy & Intense' as a primary spirit."
