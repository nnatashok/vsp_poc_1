  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Instructional: Hip Pivot\" is primarily characterized by its instructional and technique-focused nature, as depicted in the title and description emphasizing learning to build power through the hip pivot. This aligns with the \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit, as it suggests a methodical approach to training, earning it a high score of 0.8.\n\nThe inclusion of a warm-up in the metadata and the smooth, music-driven elements (evidenced by the playlist and the chosen song \"Higher\" by Creed) introduce elements of \"Flow & Rhythm.\" The music helps establish a coordination between movement and rhythm, supporting a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nThe workout image shows an outdoor setting, slightly suggesting an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" context. However, since the main focus is on technical skill in an instructional format, the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is less pronounced, warranting a low score of 0.2."
