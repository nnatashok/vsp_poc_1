  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.9 due to the explicit focus on gentle lengthening and twisting, indicative of restorative yoga. The term 'restorative' in both the title and description, along with the 'restore' tag, strongly suggests a focus on recovery and relaxation.\n\nAdditionally, a secondary spirit identified is 'Outdoor & Adventure,' scoring 0.6, as the visual provided shows the workout taking place in a scenic outdoor setting in Seville. The natural backdrop contributes to an exploratory and relaxed ambiance, enhancing the outdoor element.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the lack of indicators of high intensity or athletic focus. The chill low and cool/downtempo music further aligns with a calming and soothing atmosphere."
