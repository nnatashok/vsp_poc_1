  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Hip-Opening Align' has a strong Soothing & Restorative spirit due to its focus on 'opening your hips,' suggesting gentle movements that promote relaxation and recovery. This aligns well with the downtempo music genre that accompanies the session, enhancing the calming nature (score: 0.8). \n\nThe location in Seville on an outdoor terrace gives an Outdoor & Adventure feel, as indicated by the visible natural urban scenery and the open-air environment, although it does not dominate the workout's primary objective (score: 0.7).\n\nThe use of music tracks like 'Heat Waves' and 'Lovers,' which are rhythmic but mellow, supports a Flow & Rhythm classification. This is complemented by the description's emphasis on aligning movements, suggesting a smooth, continuous flow (score: 0.6).\n\nThe High-Energy & Intense and Sport & Agility spirits were excluded due to the absence of indicators like high intensity, technical sport specificity, or fast-paced rhythms."
