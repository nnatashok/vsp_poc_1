  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Androscoggin River Bow View', description 'Row on this sunny day along the Androscoggin River', and category label 'row' all strongly indicate that a rowing machine is needed for this workout. Rowing is explicitly mentioned and this type of journey workout is typically based on rowing simulations, which require a rowing machine to closely mimic the described activity of rowing along a river. The confidence score of 0.95 reflects the very high certainty that a rowing machine is central to the workout."
