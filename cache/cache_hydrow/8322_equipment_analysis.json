  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, titled \"Steady Speed Row,\" belongs to the categories 'breathe', 'standard', and 'row', which indicates a focus on rowing exercises. The description mentions finding resistance at the front end of the stroke, a concept associated with rowing machines. The use of 'Steady Speed Row' further implies the use of a rowing machine for a consistent rowing workout. The image complements this by showing a person rowing, strengthening the inference that a rowing machine is required for land-based replication. Therefore, the confidence score for the rowing machine is set at 0.9, indicating very high confidence based on the metadata and image context."
