  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout environment and attributes strongly suggest several relevant spirits. \"Flow & Rhythm\" is prominent with a score of 0.9, as indicated by terms like \"yoga flow\" and \"Playlist played\" featuring artists like Thievery Corporation and KAYTRANADA which are known for rhythmic melodies. The designation \"flow\" in the workout type reinforces this. \"Soothing & Restorative\" follows closely with a score of 0.85, inferred from the description phrases \"relaxing restore\" and \"leaving you rejuvenated,\" indicating a focus on relaxation and recovery. The playlist supports a calm ambiance, with songs in downtempo genres enhancing this spirit. The image shows an outdoor setting, earning \"Outdoor & Adventure\" a score of 0.7, though the primary focus remains on the mat-based routine. The absence of high-energy tags and structured descriptors led to the exclusion of other spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Structured & Disciplined.\" Overall, the metadata provides strong confidence in the identified spirits."
