  "vibesExplanation": "The workout features 'Cardio Intervals Row' which indicates a rhythmic, repetitive nature suitable for 'The Meditative Grind.' The term 'Maintain your jog pace with Mac during intervals climbing in rhythm' suggests a steady, methodical approach. Additionally, the intensity level is 1 out of 3, which aligns with the meditative aspect. The playlist includes songs like 'Softcore' and 'Sweater Weather,' which are indie alternative and not overly intense, supporting a meditative vibe. \n\n'Groove Session' is considered due to the description mentioning 'rhythm' and the playlist\u2019s indie alternative music, which can provide a fluid, expressive experience, giving it a moderate score.\n\n'Endorphin Wave' is included as a mild possibility because while the workout is lower intensity, the interval format might accumulate a feel-good movement due to the music selection which includes energetic global hits, albeit not strongly enough due to the overall calm emphasis."
