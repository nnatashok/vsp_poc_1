  "spiritsExplanation": "The title 'Lane Cove River Stern View' and the description 'Explore the serene surroundings of Syndey from the water at sunrise' strongly suggest an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, as it emphasizes a river rowing experience in a natural and exploratory setting. This is reinforced by the category 'Journeys', indicating an immersive experience. The 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is rated at a high confidence level of 0.9, as the workout is taking place on a river, aligning perfectly with the natural environment criteria. Additionally, the description mentioning 'serene surroundings' and 'sunrise' suggests a secondary spirit of 'Soothing & Restorative', reflecting a gentle and calming experience. However, this is less prominent and more inferred, thus it\u2019s assigned a lower score of 0.4. The absence of intensity or technical language in the metadata excludes the more vigorous spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined'."
