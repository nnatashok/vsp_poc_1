  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Pre-HIIT Warm-Up' features a rhythmic rowing session described as 'Climb in rhythm for 30-seconds at a time,' which aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' due to its repetitive and focused nature, earning a score of 0.7. The presence of intervals and a gradual build-up in rhythm suggests 'The Endorphin Wave,' scoring 0.6, as the workout prepares users for a main exercise routine. The music from 'Lynyrd Skynyrd' and the mention of 'Global Hits' introduces a rhythmic, enjoyable element, contributing to a 'Groove Session' vibe with a score of 0.5. These elements indicate a warm-up that is steady with some musical enjoyment, but lacks the intensity of a full-on interval session, thus other high-intensity vibes were not considered."
