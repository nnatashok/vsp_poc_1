  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Self-Care Row\" embodies a strong Soothing & Restorative spirit, indicated by the title's emphasis on 'Self-Care' and 'Take time for yourself,' which suggests a focus on relaxing and gentle exercise. The workout intensity is low (1 out of 3), and it is set to soft pop music, further supporting a calming atmosphere, reinforced by the 'breathe' category. The Outdoor & Adventure spirit is also prominent due to the setting on the Charles River, which is confirmed by the image and description. This natural environment enhances exploration and connection with nature, intrinsic to the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. Although the climb format is mentioned, the overall tone and intensity remain mild, excluding more intense spirits such as High-Energy & Intense. The playlist includes softer pop songs that align with a soothing atmosphere, reinforcing the restorative aspect. Therefore, the primary spirits are Soothing & Restorative (0.9) and Outdoor & Adventure (0.8)."
