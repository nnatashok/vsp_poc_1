Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 21 minutes, involving 'flow' type activities, which typically lean towards a slower, more relaxing pace, especially with the associated 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' music. This suggests that the workout is not extremely intense, aligning with a Light effort difficulty. However, as core-focused sessions can involve significant muscle engagement, there is moderate energy expenditure, suggesting some suitability for a higher Light and a lower Moderate difficulty level.",
