  "vibesExplanation": "The workout \"Choosing Yourself Row\" is classified primarily as 'The Meditative Grind' due to its rowing format, which involves repetitive movements that are mentally focused and endurance-driven. The reference to 'lean into mental toughness' and 'effort' supports this vibe, highlighting a mindset-oriented, enduring journey. The moody pop playlist implies a steady rhythm that aligns with a meditative zone-in experience, contributing to a score of 0.8 in this category.\n\nSecondly, the workout is a moderate-length 'sweat' session with a climb format and an intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicating a consistent but challenging effort, which fits 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe. The mix of Indie Alternative and Global Hits can elevate the feel-good, steady-building energy of the workout, supporting a score of 0.7. The combination of mental toughness and music-infused vibe rounds out the experience.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Groove Session' or 'The Warrior Workout' are less applicable due to the absence of explicit rhythmic or high-intensity elements. Overall, the workout provides an endurance-focused, mentally engaging session."
