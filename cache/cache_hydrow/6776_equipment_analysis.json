  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description explicitly mentions 'row with Laine' and focuses on 'technique of each stroke,' indicating the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the category clearly includes 'row,' which strongly confirms the necessity of a rowing machine. The metadata does not list any other equipment, and no alternative equipment is suggested in the description or category. Therefore, with very high confidence, a rowing machine is required for this workout."
