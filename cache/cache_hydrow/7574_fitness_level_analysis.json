  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of just 10:38 and described as a core pilates workout, this suggests moderate energy expenditure. It's described as 'challenging,' yet the brief duration in combination with Pilates typically puts it in the moderate range of effort. There is some consideration for it being Light due to the non-cardio nature, but 'challenging' indicates a stronger alignment with Moderate.",
