This suggests a vigorous and demanding session, further emphasized by the energetic music playlist including 'dance high' and 'global hits'. The 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is strongly present as the workout is conducted on a water-based rowing setup, highlighting the natural environment and adventure aspect. Additionally, the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is evident, with the workout being segmented into 10-minute blocks that build progressively, indicating a methodical approach. These combined elements strongly support the chosen spirits with high confidence."
