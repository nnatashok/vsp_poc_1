  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Calming Restorative Yoga,\" indicating a focus on calmness and restoration. The description mentions 'calm your body and mind,' aligning with practices that emphasize grounding and breath-centered movements. The use of 'restorative practice' suggests a slow, intentional pace, fitting 'The Zen Flow' with high confidence (0.9). The chill, downtempo music also supports a calm and grounding vibe.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of 'restorative practice' and the short duration (under 6 minutes) suggest an emphasis on relaxation and nervous system reset, aligning with 'The Deep Recharge' (0.7). This workout does not aim for intense physical engagement or energy-building, so more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor' are excluded."
