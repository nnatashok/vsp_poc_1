  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is designed as a post-row session focused on alignment, with emphasis on hips, hamstrings, and spine. This suggests a restorative purpose, fitting 'The Reboot Workout' vibe. The music genre being 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo', along with songs like 'Sunlight (Feat. Years And Years) [Darius Remix]', implies a relaxing atmosphere, enhancing this classification. The short duration of 10 minutes and the absence of intense exercise support a gentle, restorative nature.\n\n'Zen Flow' is a suitable vibe since the workout is described as 'align yoga,' focusing on intentional, breathing-centered movement. The equipment-free, mat-based setting and chill music underscore an unhurried, grounding experience. \n\nOther vibes were excluded due to the lack of intensity and competitive elements in the workout."
