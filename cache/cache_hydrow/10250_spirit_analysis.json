  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under 'High-Energy & Intense' due to explicit mentions of phrases such as 'push your limits,' 'feel the burn,' 'high-intensity session,' and 'maximizing your power strokes.' The use of high-intensity music genres like Hip Hop/R&B High and the workout intensity level being marked 3 out of 3 further support this spirit, resulting in a high confidence score of 0.95.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' could be considered due to the mention of rhythm, but it lacks the smooth, continuous movement emphasis to make it a strong candidate. 'Structured & Disciplined' is given a score of 0.75 because the workout follows a specific interval format with repetitions ('10 powerful strokes at a time') which indicates a methodical approach, directed by the technical precision and discipline of rowing.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' was excluded because there is no indication of an outdoor setting. 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Sport & Agility' are also not suitable due to the explicit emphasis on intensity and muscle building rather than recovery, agility, or sports-specific skills."
