  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Bodyweight Strength\" focuses on increasing heart rate and building strength, which suggests elements of a \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit. This is supported by the use of lively music genres like Hip Hop/R&B and Global Hits, which typically accompany high-energy sessions, justifying a score of 0.7.\n\nThe setting on a dock overlooking water and cityscape provides an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. The workout is performed in an outdoor environment, even though it is mat-based, warranting a score of 0.6 due to the natural and adventurous backdrop.\n\nThe categorization as \"On The Mat\" and \"strength\" suggests some degree of planned exercise structure, meriting a \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit with a score of 0.5. The workout likely follows a systematic approach with rounds, indicating discipline and consistency. Other spirits like \"Soothing & Restorative\" and \"Flow & Rhythm\" were less apparent due to the focus on strength and intensity."
