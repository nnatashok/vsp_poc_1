  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is predominantly classified as 'The Reboot Workout' with a high score of 0.9. This is because the focus is on a gradual heart rate reduction and cool down, as indicated by phrases like 'gradually bring down your heart rate' and 'cool down.' The use of chill and downtempo music further supports this vibe, as it aligns with a relaxing, unwinding atmosphere typical of a Reboot Workout. 'The Comfort Moves' is next with a score of 0.6, reflecting the low-pressure setup designed to be accessible and comfortable ('rowing at a walking pace'), suitable for all fitness levels. Lastly, 'The Deep Recharge' scores a 0.5, as the workout seems to aid in nervous system reset by providing a very gentle ending to a potentially intense rowing session. The overall confidence is high due to clear indicators in the metadata that support a calming and restorative workout environment."
