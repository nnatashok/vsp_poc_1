  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Power Pyramid Row' is characterized by structured progression, indicated by the 'Pyramid' format and 'climb in rhythm and intensity' description. This suggests a methodical and disciplined approach, justifying the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.75. The workout is performed outdoors on a river, as visible in the image, fitting the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit well, thus receiving a score of 0.65. The playlist, featuring energetic indie alternative and global hits, alongside an emphasis on sweat and rhythm, supports elements of the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, yielding a score of 0.6. The intensity level is 2 out of 3, pointing towards a significant, though not maximum, energy expenditure. Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Flow & Rhythm' are less applicable due to the pyramid and sweat focus, which emphasize intensity and structure."
