  "vibesExplanation": "The workout name 'March Race: Week 4 of 5' and description 'race to accumulate maximum meters' strongly align with 'The Competitor' vibe, focusing on gamification and leaderboard-driven energy, scoring 0.85 due to these explicit indicators.\n\nThe intense duration of 11 minutes 28 seconds and maximum rhythm of 32, classified as 'Power', contribute to 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe. The intensity level 3/3 and the pop-punk, global hits playlist suggest a heart-racing, full-body intensity experience, reflected in a 0.7 score.\n\nThe use of energizing music tracks like 'Pain' by Jimmy Eat World and 'I Stand Alone' by Jackyl, along with the rhythmic nature of rowing, support 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe. The beat-driven playlist and high-intensity format lead to a score of 0.6, capturing the strong but fluid and music-infused essence."
