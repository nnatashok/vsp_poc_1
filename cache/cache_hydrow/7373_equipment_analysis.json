  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which indicates it is rowing-related. The image further confirms this as it shows an individual rowing. Despite being a 'cool down' workout, the inclusion of 'row' in the category and the visual evidence support a need for a rowing machine. Thus, the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high at 1.0."
