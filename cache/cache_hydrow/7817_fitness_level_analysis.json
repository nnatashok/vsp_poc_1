  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which restricts technique difficulty to 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate' levels. The workout's focus on 4-minute and 45-second interval rowing sets suggests that a Beginner to Intermediate understanding of rowing form is adequate. In addition, the instructor Dani Hansen provides high-energy, expert technical instruction, accessible to Beginners but tailored to develop Intermediate skills.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of over 31 minutes with interval training indicates a demanding physical effort. The max rhythm of 30 and interval format (4-minute and 45-second sets) suggests moderate to challenging energy expenditure especially for deconditioned users. Given the intensity level of 2 out of 3 and high-energy music from the 80s hits, users will find the workout moderately to challenging in terms of effort.",
