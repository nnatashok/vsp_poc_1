  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit for this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.9. This is supported by the title 'Hamstring Stretch' and the description focusing on stretching and using props like yoga blocks, which are indicative of relaxation and restoration. The brief 5-minute duration also suggests a gentle, restorative session. \n\nAdditionally, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is included with a score of 0.6. The image depicts an outdoor setting near a body of water, which aligns with the spirit of engaging with nature and outdoor environments.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' were not chosen due to the lack of indicators for a continuous or highly methodical workout. The music, while upbeat, does not heavily impact the restorative nature or setting of the session."
