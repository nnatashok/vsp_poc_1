  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe classification is based on the workout name, description, and music playlist. 'Bodyweight Strength' suggests a focus on bodyweight exercises, combined with the 'strength' category indicating consistent, repetitive movements potentially associated with 'The Meditative Grind' (score 0.5). However, the playlist featuring 'dance mid' and 'global hits' with songs like 'Somebody To Love (Club Mix)' and the location in Bardini Garden creates a fun and engaging atmosphere suggestive of 'The Groove Session' (score 0.75). The dance and club influences in the playlist also align with 'The Nightclub Workout' (score 0.6), as they provide an energetic and lively backdrop. The picturesque setting further enhances the experience, adding to the workout's overall vibe diversity."
