  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which limits the Technique Difficulty to either 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate'. As the intensity involves a climb in rhythm, culminating at a rhythm of 28, it suggests some complexity in coordination and stamina management, aligning with the higher bandwidth of a 'Beginner' and lower 'Intermediate' level. Given the increasing intensity and pacing instructions, a blend of Beginner and Intermediate Technique Difficulty is appropriate.",
