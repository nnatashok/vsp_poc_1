  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled 'Legs + Core Cool-Down' explicitly refers to rowing, which indicates the use of a rowing machine. The description mentions 'rowing with your legs only and pausing with your core over,' highlighting a technique-focused session designed to emphasize proper form with a rowing machine. Furthermore, the category includes 'row,' which strongly suggests rowing equipment as essential. The image also supports this as it shows an individual using a rowing device, reinforcing the context of rowing. Thus, the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high at 1.0."
