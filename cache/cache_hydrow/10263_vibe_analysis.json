  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Glute and Core Burner Circuit' is a short, focused workout that emphasizes glute, leg, and core strength using a mini-band and foam roller. The circuit format and specific muscle targeting align with 'The Meditative Grind,' which focuses on repetitive, focused movement. This vibe is supported by the descriptive phrases 'improving your glute, leg, and core strength' and 'circuit format.' The use of instructional elements and equipment supports the inclusion of 'The Masterclass Workout' due to the instruction-oriented and skill-building aspects of using specific equipment like a foam roller. The 'rock mid-intensity' music suggests a motivational, steady progression element, contributing to 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe with its feel-good, steady energy characteristic. Since it's a 10-minute workout, there's a moderate confidence in these classifications."
