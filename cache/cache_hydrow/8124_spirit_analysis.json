  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Twists Align' is set outdoors with a view of the mountains in Norway, as seen in the image, which strongly suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 1.0). The environment and the emphasis on opening the side body and moving through twists align this workout with nature-based and exploration elements. The use of relaxing music genres like 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo,' as well as the playlist including songs with calm and introspective themes, suggests a 'Soothing & Restorative' element (score: 0.7), emphasizing relaxation and recovery. The continuous movement patterns involved in twisting imply a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.5), though less strongly than the other aspects. The 'On The Mat' category indicates controlled and focused movements, but does not alone suggest a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. Overall confidence in this analysis is high (0.9) due to clear indicators from the metadata and visuals."
