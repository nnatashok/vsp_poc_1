  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of this workout is 'The Warrior Workout' with a score of 0.7. This is based on the 'high intensity intervals' and the '3 out of 3' intensity level, suggesting a demanding, sweat-inducing effort, characteristic of warrior-style training. Additionally, the 'Drive' and 'standard' rowing elements align with a persistent, high-effort theme.\n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Nightclub Workout' with a score of 0.6. This is inferred from the use of 'Pop high, Global Hits' music, which suggests a dynamic, energetic atmosphere akin to a club environment, supporting a lively and engaging workout experience.\n\nFinally, 'The Meditative Grind' receives a score of 0.4. Although the intensity is high, the sustained focus required for rowing over 21 minutes fits the meditative and rhythmic characteristics of this vibe, albeit to a moderate degree. The presence of core work adds to this steady, methodical engagement. \n\nOther vibes, like 'The Groove Session', were considered but excluded due to the lack of explicit dance elements or expressive movement cues."
