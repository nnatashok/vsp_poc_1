  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'English Bay Stern View' is highly indicative of the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The title and description explicitly mention rowing along English Bay, which suggests a natural water-based setting typical of outdoor adventure workouts. The category 'Journey' further supports this, implying exploration and the scenic aspect of Vancouver's bridges and buildings. No specific reference to high intensity, rhythm, or technical structuring in the metadata indicates the absence of those spirits. Therefore, it's unlikely to be classified under 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Flow & Rhythm', or 'Structured & Disciplined'. The spirit of 'Outdoor & Adventure' receives a score of 0.95 due to the very strong alignment with the environmental and exploratory elements described in the metadata. Confidence in this classification is very high given the clear indicators of nature-based rowing."
