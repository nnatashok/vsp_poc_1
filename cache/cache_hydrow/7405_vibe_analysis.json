  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Cardio Intervals Row' involves interval training with a focus on 'building rhythm,' indicative of 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, which involves zoning into repetitive motions. The workout format is row-based intervals, aligning well with this vibe at a score of 0.8 for its emphasis on consistent rhythm across the workout.\n\nThe presence of 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' radio stations, along with the playlist featuring electronic and dance tracks (such as 'Heartlines (Mount Remix)' and 'Get Out My Head'), suggests a 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe due to the beat-driven element and strong rhythm, earning it a score of 0.7.\n\nThe incorporation of popular dance music and the interval nature introduces elements of expressiveness and being in the moment, aligning with 'The Groove Session' vibe, therefore receiving a score of 0.5. This vibe is less dominant but still present in the emotional quality of the workout.\n\nThe description mentions sharing personal experiences during the intervals, which supports a more engaged and personalized session, enhancing the rhythmic aspects even further."
