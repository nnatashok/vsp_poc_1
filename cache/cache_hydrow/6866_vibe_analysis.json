  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Technique Warm-Up,' with a focus on reinforcing technique with specific mentions of 'strokes with legs only, legs and core, and full strokes.' This strongly indicates a 'Masterclass Workout' vibe (score: 0.9), as it focuses on skill-building and technique. The inclusion of terms like 'warm-up' and the format specified as 'technique' support the emphasis on mastering rowing mechanics.\n\nThe use of techniques like 'legs only' strokes and the repetitive nature of the exercises suggest a rhythmic and focused experience typical of 'The Meditative Grind' (score: 0.7). The emphasis here is on repeated, focused practice rather than high intensity.\n\nAs the workout serves as a warm-up and involves technique reinforcement, there's also a sense of gentle preparation, aligning with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe (score: 0.5). This vibe is about preparing and refreshing the body, which fits the description of this session.\n\nMusic from pop hits ('Slam Dunk (Da Funk)' and 'Flava In Ya Ear') gives a light, familiar momentum but is not a central factor due to the focus on technique."
