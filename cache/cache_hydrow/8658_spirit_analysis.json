Additionally, the HIIT format and upbeat, energetic playlist further support this categorization, resulting in a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe workout is also categorized as \"Outdoor & Adventure\" because it takes place on the Hillsborough River, clearly an outdoor and nature-based setting. This environment is integral to the experience, and the rowing aspect reinforces the adventure element.
