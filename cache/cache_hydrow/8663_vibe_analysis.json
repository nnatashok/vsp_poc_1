  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Hip-Hop HIIT Row' primarily aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' due to its high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format and focus on \"igniting your legs and lungs.\" The description mentions climbing in rhythm and effort, indicating a rigorous, sweat-inducing exercise style. The short duration (11 minutes) suggests a powerful, quick session, supporting a strong match with this vibe. \n\nAdditionally, the use of a hip-hop playlist featuring artists like Drake and Post Malone, and the mention of a 'max rhythm' element, strongly relates to 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe. This vibe captures the energetic and rhythmic experience associated with upbeat music and a high-energy setting, further enhanced by the music genre and radio stations played, despite them not being explicitly specified.\n\nNo clear indicators suggest a more meditative or technique-focused workout, thus excluding vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Masterclass Workout.' The confidence in this classification is high (0.85) due to explicit and implicit evidence from the title, description, and music choices."
