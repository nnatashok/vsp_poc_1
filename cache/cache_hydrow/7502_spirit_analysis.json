  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'runners-focused Pilates session,' which aligns with 'Structured & Disciplined' due to its emphasis on strengthening specific areas (hips and core). The presence of explicit lyrics and a playlist featuring upbeat pop music, including tracks like 'Big Energy' and 'Came Here For Love,' suggests a rhythmic movement focus, supporting the 'Flow & Rhythm' classification. The image shows the workout being performed outdoors in a natural setting, which fits 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the environmental component. While the workout does have structure, the primary emphasis on music-driven flow and outdoor setting plays a significant role, hence the scores reflect these aspects with 'Flow & Rhythm' being the most dominant."
