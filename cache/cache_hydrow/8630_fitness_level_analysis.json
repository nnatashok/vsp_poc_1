  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the category 'Drive' and 'row'. According to Hydrow-specific rules, 'Drive' workouts are considered Advanced for technique difficulty, but since this is predominantly rowing-based, it can only be categorized as Beginner or Intermediate. Given the inclusion of HIIT format with rhythm climbing, this likely involves maintaining consistent rowing form amidst varying intensities, which can be moderately complex for beginners. Thus, Intermediate (score: 0.6) is most fitting, with a moderate alignment to Beginner (score: 0.4).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 21-minute HIIT row with a maximum rhythm of 30, designed to 'ignite your legs and lungs'. This indicates a high energy demand, fitting the Challenging to Extreme categories. The 'Intensity level: 3 out of 3' strongly suggests high effort, although the 21-minute duration moderates it slightly. Therefore, Challenging (score: 0.6) and Extreme (score: 0.4) are appropriate, reflecting the advanced intensity cues prompted by this drive workout.",
