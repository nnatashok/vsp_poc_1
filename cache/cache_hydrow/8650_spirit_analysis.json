  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Commit to Fit: Keep Coming Back Strength' primarily embodies a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, with a strong focus on whole-body strength exercises such as planks, lunges, and RDLs. These exercises require specific techniques and a methodical approach, aligning with structured training protocols. This spirit is reinforced by the mention of a fitness 'partner leading you,' indicating a guided, orderly session. A score of 0.8 reflects the strong alignment with this spirit.\n\nThe session also contains elements of 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as the exercises included (e.g., planks, up-downs) are typically dynamic and require considerable effort, aligning with intense training modes. While the music genre specifics were not provided, the inclusion of 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits' suggests an energetic backdrop. The indoor setup doesn't contribute to 'Outdoor & Adventure,' hence it is excluded. The combination of elements leads to a score of 0.6 for the high-energy spirit."
