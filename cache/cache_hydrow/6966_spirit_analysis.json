  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"Flow & Rhythm\" due to the \"Power Yoga Flow\" title and description noting a progression from slow to more vigorous movements, implying a continuous and coordinated movement pattern. The use of the term \"flow\" strongly suggests a focus on the seamless transition between poses, characteristic of a flow-driven session. The chill and downtempo music playlist further supports this classification by enhancing the rhythmic and connected nature of the workout. This spirit is given a score of 0.8, indicating a strong match.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is highly relevant with a score of 0.9, supported by the workout being conducted outdoors in the snowy landscape of New Hampshire, providing an element of nature-based exploration and environmental challenge. The visuals and outdoor setting significantly contribute to this spirit, emphasizing the adventurous aspect of outdoor workouts. Other spirits were considered less relevant due to the absence of high-intensity or structured training indicators."
