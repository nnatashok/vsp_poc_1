  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout \"Unleashed Row\" is categorized under 'row', indicating a rowing-focused session. The description mentions tackling intervals, which is typically done on a rowing machine in indoor settings. Although the image appears to show outdoor rowing, the metadata strongly implies this is an indoor rowing workout, likely using a rowing machine, given the music and duration format which align with indoor workouts. Therefore, the confidence for a rowing machine is set at 0.95."
