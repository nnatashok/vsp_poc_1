Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 20:45 and a focus on whole-body pilates, the workout is likely to have a moderate energy expenditure suitable for less fit individuals. The duration is relatively short, which keeps the effort level low, but full-body engagement suggests it may still be somewhat challenging. Therefore, this could be perceived as Light to Moderate in effort difficulty for deconditioned users.",
