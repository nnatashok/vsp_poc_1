  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Power Yoga Flow' strongly embodies the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, as indicated by the title and description. The term 'flow' explicitly suggests smooth, continuous movement patterns typical of flow-based workouts. The accompanying music playlist, featuring tracks with a Chill mid and Cool/Downtempo vibe, reinforces this interpretation by emphasizing rhythmic movement and mind-body connection. Therefore, a high score of 0.9 is assigned.\n\nThe workout also contains elements of the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, evident from the calming music genre and the yoga context, which often incorporates relaxation and stress-reduction elements. However, the word 'power' suggests some energetic elements, thus a moderate score of 0.7 is given here.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility,' are less applicable due to the lack of emphasis on intensity, competition, or athletic skills, as the focus remains on flow and relaxation."
