  "vibesExplanation": "The workout features rowing with \"Teammate Energy,\" involving two 4-minute intervals, which suggests a repetitive and consistent rhythm usually found in 'The Meditative Grind.' The pacing, with a max rhythm of 26 and an intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicates a steady effort that's not overly intense.\n\nThe musical choices, including tracks like 'Dirty Paws' and indie/alternative selections, contribute to a calming and consistent mood, supporting this vibe.\n\nThe presence of upbeat, rhythmic songs such as 'Moves Like Jagger' hints slightly towards 'The Groove Session,' marked by fluid and expressive movement, though this is less prominent.\n\n'The Endorphin Wave' is also applicable given the workout\u2019s emphasis on sustained movement and team energy, providing an invigorating yet moderate experience.\n\nThe short duration prevents the classification from being a perfect match for 'The Meditative Grind,' but it's the strongest fit based on the structured format and emotional energy described."
