  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.9, due to its location on the Thames River, which implies an outdoor setting and an element of exploration and adventure. This categorization is supported by the image showing the participants on a river. Additionally, the inclusion of \"Race on the Thames\" in the title emphasizes the outdoor, adventure-based context of the session.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also a suitable spirit with a score of 0.6. The workout description mentions 'ignite your leg drive and set your pace,' and the music playlist, featuring motivational tracks like 'We Will Rock You,' suggests a rhythmic, engaging flow. The format of 'Interval' and 'max rhythm 32' indicates a structured pacing element, which aligns with movement patterns that require coordination and rhythmic engagement.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit was considered but not included due to the focus on the warm-up and rhythmic elements rather than strictly technique-driven elements. 'High-Energy & Intense' was not selected as the primary nature is warming up rather than pushing limits."
