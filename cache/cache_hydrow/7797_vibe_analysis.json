  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Steady Cool-Down,' and its description emphasize a steady, calm rowing experience along the Charles River, which aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. This vibe is characterized by a zone-in, repetitive nature, suitable for steady rowing workouts. The music choice featuring Taylor Swift, known for soothing and popular hits, further supports the calming and repetitive focus of the session. Hence, a score of 0.8 was assigned.\n\nAdditionally, the workout is classified as a cool-down with a short duration, aligning it with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, aimed at relaxation and refreshment after an intense session. The vibe supports the low-intensity cool-down focus of the workout. Therefore, a score of 0.6 is assigned. \n\nThe presence of relaxing, popular music and the serene river setting also aids in creating a tranquil atmosphere typical of these vibes. Other vibes like 'The Zen Flow' were considered but didn't match as well due to the workout's specific rowing and cool-down focus."
