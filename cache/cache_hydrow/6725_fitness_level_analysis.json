  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout type as 'drive' and category as 'row', the technique difficulty is limited to either Beginner or Intermediate as per Hydrow-specific rules. The term 'drive' suggests an advanced focus but remains within rowing-specific guidelines, which caps the possible difficulty at Intermediate. Therefore, the technique required is primarily in maintaining proper rowing form during power strokes, aligning strongly with the Intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration of 11:27 is compact but implies high-intensity intervals given the power format and maximum rhythm over 30. The descriptor 'turn up the heat' and the goal to achieve a personal best indicate significant effort, aligning mostly with Challenging. However, given the compact session length, the workout can still accommodate those at a Moderate level of fitness as an intense yet brief workout.",
