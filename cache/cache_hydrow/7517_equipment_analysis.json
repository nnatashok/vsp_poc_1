  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is identified with the category tag 'row,' which strongly indicates the use of a Rowing machine. The title 'Running + Sprinting Pace Row' suggests a focus on rowing intervals. Additionally, 'row' in the category and the context of increasing rhythm and effort align with the use of a rowing machine, justifying a very high confidence score for requiring a Rowing machine."
