  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Post-Row Mobility with Foam Roller' emphasizes mobility and stretching, aligning with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe. The description mentions lengthening the spine and opening the hips, which indicates a gentle, restorative focus that is characteristic of a reboot-style workout. The use of a foam roller further reinforces this vibe, as it is commonly associated with recovery and flexibility work. The short duration (5 minutes 35 seconds) supports a quick refresh session. The playlist, featuring upbeat tracks like 'Con Calma' and 'Morado', adds a rhythmic element, introducing aspects of 'The Groove Session' vibe. The lively music from Latin and Global Hits radio stations suggests a fun, engaging atmosphere. However, the primary focus on mobility and recovery justifies the higher score for 'The Reboot Workout'. There is no indication of intense activity, excluding other high-intensity vibes."
