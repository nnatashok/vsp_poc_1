  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The 'HIIT Speed Row' workout's technique difficulty is primarily determined by its workout type and category as a 'Drive' and 'row' workout. Despite the 'Advanced' user fitness level requirement, Hydrow's specific rule sets a cap at 'Intermediate' for rowing technique, which aligns well given the emphasis on short intervals at high rhythms. The mention of focus on proper form enhances the possibility of 'Advanced' difficulty, but the inherent simplicity of rowing maintains the cap at 'Intermediate'.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty leans towards 'Challenging' due to the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format and the maximum rhythm of 32. The workout intensity level is marked as 3 out of 3, indicating significant demand. The workout duration of approximately 16 minutes combined with Nick's credentials reinforces the moderate to high effort necessary, bordering 'Extreme'.",
