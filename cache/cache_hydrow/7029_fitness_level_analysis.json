Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is short, lasting only 5 minutes and 36 seconds, and is categorized as a stretching session, which typically involves low energy expenditure. This aligns with a Light effort difficulty (score: 1.0), as the exercises are meant for relaxation and recovery following a rowing session, rather than exertion. There are no indicators in the metadata suggesting increased intensity or a faster pace, supporting the Light classification with high confidence.",
