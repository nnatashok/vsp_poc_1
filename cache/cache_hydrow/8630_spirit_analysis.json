  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Bootcamp HIIT Row' is described as a high-intensity interval training session, focusing on 'igniting legs and lungs' which strongly indicates a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit with very high confidence. The use of '80-second intervals' and setting the rhythm at 'Max rhythm: 30' reinforce this classification, emphasizing intensity and cardiovascular challenge, thus earning a score of 0.9.\n\nThe presence of upbeat and energetic tracks, such as those by Fall Out Boy and Ti\u00ebsto, further supports the intense nature of the session. The workout is also conducted on a river as seen in the image, clearly situating it in an outdoor environment, which aligns with an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Given that the session utilizes natural surroundings, this spirit is assigned a score of 0.8. \n\nNo elements of 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are evident, as the session lacks focus on smooth coordination or relaxation."
