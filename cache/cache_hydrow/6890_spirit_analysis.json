  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \u2018Weekly Conditioning Row\u2019 is classified primarily as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a strong score of 0.8 due to the image showing rowing on open water, an activity that naturally fits this category. The mention of the interval format at a rhythm of 26, along with the term 'conditioning', suggests a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, scoring 0.7. The high energy dance and global hits music further supports the intensity. 'Flow & Rhythm' scores 0.6 because the 3' intervals may encourage rhythmic pacing, as indicated by coordinating with music and maintaining a set rhythm. The workout doesn't strongly match 'Soothing & Restorative', 'Sport & Agility', or 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits, as it lacks relaxation focus, sports-specific skills, or methodical training details."
