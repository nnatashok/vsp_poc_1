  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description clearly indicates a 'Post-Row Stretch' focusing on hips and glutes, typically requiring a mat for comfort during stretches. The category 'On The Mat' strongly implies the use of a mat, justifying a high confidence score of 0.9. Additionally, yoga blocks are explicitly recommended, resulting in a confidence score of 0.8. The image supports this, showing the mat and blocks, aligning with activities like stretching where these items are beneficial. No other equipment is suggested or required according to the metadata."
