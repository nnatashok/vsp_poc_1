  "spiritsExplanation": "The \"Wrist Technique Cool-Down\" is characterized by its focus on maintaining a flat wrist, as noted in the description. This positions the workout strongly in the **Structured & Disciplined** spirit, with a score of 0.75 due to the emphasis on technical precision and rhythm (\"Max rhythm: 20, Format: Technique\"). This structured approach traditionally aligns with precision in form and deliberate pacing.\n\nThe **Soothing & Restorative** spirit is a secondary match, with a score of 0.6. The term 'cool-down' implies a focus on recovery and relaxation, characteristics of soothing sessions.\n\nFinally, **Outdoor & Adventure** receives a score of 0.5, reflective of the activity taking place on water. The environmental context supports an adventurous aspect, but the session remains primarily technique-focused.\n\nPotential music influences (Dance mid, Global Hits) are secondary factors contributing to overall feel, but not central to this classification. Other spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Sport & Agility\" are less relevant due to the deliberate pace and focus on technique rather than intensity or agility."
