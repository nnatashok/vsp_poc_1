  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Drive' and 'row,' and involves high-intensity interval training (HIIT) focusing on rhythms conducive to rowing activity. The term 'row' in the category strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the workout description mentions 'ignite your legs and lungs,' suggesting a cardio-based workout typical of a rowing machine session. Given these points, there is very high confidence (1.0) that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
