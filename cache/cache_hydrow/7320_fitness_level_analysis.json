Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is only 5 minutes and 52 seconds, categorized as a 'cool down'. Cool-down activities typically feature low energy expenditure to allow for recovery post-exercise. The description suggests a focus on technique rather than intense physical exertion, and the music selection from dance and global hits stations suggests a moderate tempo, further supporting a relaxed pace. Therefore, this workout aligns strongly with the Light effort difficulty category.",
