  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the description emphasizing 'gentle flow' and a 'focus on your breath,' indicating a smooth and continuous movement pattern. The tag 'flow' in the workout type further supports this classification, resulting in a high confidence level of 0.75.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also applicable since the workout is described as 'gentle,' which implies a calming, recovery-focused session. The use of chill and downtempo music, along with acoustic and slower-paced tracks in the playlist, complement this soothing atmosphere. This spirit receives a confidence score of 0.7.\n\nAdditionally, the visual depiction of an outdoor setting places the workout partially in the 'Outdoor & Adventure' category, as the natural surroundings contribute to an adventure element. The confidence level here is slightly lower at 0.6, since the primary focus is still on flow and soothing dynamics."
