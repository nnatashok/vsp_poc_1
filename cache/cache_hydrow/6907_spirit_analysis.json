  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the workout \"Intentional Cool-Down\" is 'Soothing & Restorative.' This classification is supported by several explicit indicators: the workout is described as a 'cool down' and suggests how to incorporate cool-downs into a regular routine, which aligns with a focus on recovery and relaxation. The steady format with a max rhythm of 22 further suggests a gentle and restorative pace, underscoring the cool-down nature. The presence of calm music from radio stations like Rock low and Global Hits supports a soothing environment.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant, given the image showing rowing on a river, which aligns with natural, environmental settings typical of this spirit. The outdoor rowing context contributes to an adventurous or explorative feel, meriting a secondary classification.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Flow & Rhythm,' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the workout's emphasis on cooling down rather than intense activity, rhythm-based flow, or sports agility."
