  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is labeled with the category \"row,\" which strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine. The title \"Four Types of Focus Row\" and the description mentioning increased cardio through intervals at a jog and run pace further support the need for rowing equipment. Given the standard format of this platform, the image of rowing on water aligns with a stationary rowing workout. Therefore, the rowing machine is identified as necessary with very high confidence."
