Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 30 minutes, which is moderate for a bodyweight session. The specificity of 'firing up your lower body and core' suggests a focus on exercises that are more intense than light cardio yet not at the peak level required for heavy lifting or more high-intensity interval training. The lack of specified rest periods and equipment means it's likely challenging for those with low fitness levels yet provides a manageable, sustainable effort for those slightly more trained, hence aligning mostly with Moderate but partially with Challenging.",
