  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Twists Align' combines elements suitable for 'The Zen Flow' and 'The Nature Flow'. The description highlights 'opening up your side body' and 'moving through twists,' which are typically associated with a grounding and breath-centered practice, aligning with 'The Zen Flow'. The setting in the mountains of Norway and the mention of a cool, downtempo playlist support a calming and intentional flow, which is characteristic of this vibe. The inclusion of songs like 'Epiphany' and 'Dancing With Your Ghost' further emphasize a soothing, reflective atmosphere. \n\nAdditionally, the outdoor setting and scenic mountains contribute to 'The Nature Flow', emphasizing a breath-centered experience in an outdoor environment. The playlist supports this with its chill and downtempo vibe, fostering a connection to nature and rhythm. The 16-minute duration is suitable for a gentle session focused on alignment rather than high intensity. These factors collectively warrant a high confidence level in classifying this workout under these vibes."
