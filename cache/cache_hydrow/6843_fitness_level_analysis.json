  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which aligns with the rule that technique difficulty can be either Beginner or Intermediate. The use of varied stroke rates (22, 26, and 28) suggests some level of coordination, slightly increasing technique complexity to Intermediate. However, rowing is fundamentally simple, leaning more towards Beginner techniques, supported by the label 'standard row.'",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's classification as 'sweat' and its 16-minute duration suggest a moderate to challenging physical effort level. The 'sweat' type and intensity level 2 out of 3 indicate a workout that's more demanding than basic endurance exercises but not extremely taxing. Interval training with varying stroke rates implies increased cardiovascular demand, elevating effort to between Moderate and Challenging.",
