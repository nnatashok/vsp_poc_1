  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 10 minutes and a focus on standing yoga, the energy expenditure and physical demand are relatively low, which is typical for 'Light' effort level. The terms 'chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' for the radio stations further suggest a low-intensity workout. There may be some alignment towards 'Moderate' due to the emphasis on posture alignment, which could challenge less coordinated individuals moderately, but overall, the light nature is predominant.",
