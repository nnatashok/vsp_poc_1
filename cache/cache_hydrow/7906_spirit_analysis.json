  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Endurance Builder Row' emphasizes building endurance through a series of intervals, implicitly reflecting a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The use of intervals and the focus on steady endurance development confirms this classification, resulting in a strong match with a score of 0.75.\n\nThe playlist featuring classic rock music, along with the description noting a focus on rhythm ('Max rhythm: 30'), suggests the presence of a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The classic rock playlist enhances the rhythmic element of the workout, giving it a score of 0.6.\n\nThe image shows rowing on a river, explicitly indicating the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This setting naturally integrates the environmental challenge and exploration aspect, which is strongly represented, scoring 0.8. Overall, the spirits 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Soothing & Restorative', and 'Sport & Agility' were not selected due to the low intensity level and absence of performance or restorative elements."
