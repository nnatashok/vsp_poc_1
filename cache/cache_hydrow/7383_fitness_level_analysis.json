  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as a 'drive' row, which, according to Hydrow's specific rules, positions its Technique Difficulty as 'Intermediate'. The intervals of sprinting and max pacing require additional rowing skills and rhythm management (max rhythm: 28), which aligns with an intermediate level of coordination and technical execution. Although the workout is intense, the fundamental rowing movements remain consistent with an intermediate technique level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is highly demanding with a max intensity level of 3 out of 3, focused on sprint and max pace intervals over an 11-minute duration. This indicates high physical exertion, supported by the sprinting nature of a HIIT format that has both intense effort periods and very physical recovery. The session is likely 'Challenging' to 'Extreme' for a less fit individual due to high energy output and short rests in a HIIT setting, especially for users with low fitness endurance.",
