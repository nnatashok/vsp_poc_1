  "vibesExplanation": "The workout \"Fix Your Posture\" with a focus on 'mobility' indicates an intent to improve foundational aspects of fitness, making 'The Foundation Builder' a highly appropriate vibe (score: 0.9). The short duration of 10 minutes and emphasis on everyday posture improvement aligns well with the idea of strengthening weak points. \n\nAdditionally, the workout's focus on mobility suggests a refreshing, low-stress routine, aligning with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe (score: 0.75). This vibe is supported by the nature of mobility exercises, which typically aim to refresh and improve movement quality without high intensity.\n\nFinally, the use of 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits' music hints at a calming, flow-like experience, lending a mild association to 'The Zen Flow' vibe (score: 0.6). This is less prominent but suggests a grounding and intentional practice based on the likely gentle and breath-centered activities involved.\n\nConfidence is high (0.85) due to strong indicators from the workout description and type, although music details add slight ambiguity."
