  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Beginner Bursts Row' involves steady rowing with 2-minute intervals and 30-second bursts. The description of 'steady' and a low intensity level (1 out of 3) suggest a calm and repetitive nature, aligning with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The score of 0.7 indicates a strong match, as endurance rowing allows one to zone in and let repetition take over.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of music genres like Indie Alternative and Global Hits, along with songs such as 'Gold' by Imagine Dragons, support an elevated yet comfortable energy, also characteristic of 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe. The bursts of speed provide a steady build in energy, earning a 0.6 score for this vibe.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor' are excluded due to the low intensity and absence of competitive elements or high aggression. The music choice and interval format also provide a light challenge, but not to an extreme, reinforcing these vibe selections."
