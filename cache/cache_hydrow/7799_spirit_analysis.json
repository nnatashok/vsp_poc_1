  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the emphasis on maintaining specific rowing rhythms (22 and 24) and practicing rowing with eye closure, suggesting a focus on smooth, coordinated movement and mind-body connection, scoring 0.7. The term 'cool down' and inclusion of slower rhythms also points toward a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as these elements indicate a gentle, recovery-focused session, scoring 0.6. The image depicts outdoor rowing on a river, aligning with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit at a score of 0.5. This classification is further supported by the playlist choices, which are less intense and align with relaxation. Although structured elements are present, the lack of explicit training protocols excludes the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit."
