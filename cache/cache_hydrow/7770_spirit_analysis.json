  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is strongly aligned with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to the combination of HIIT format, maximum rhythm of 34, and intensity level rated 3 out of 3, indicating a vigorous and challenging session. The playlist includes upbeat pop and global hits, further emphasizing energy and drive music-wise.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is a significant aspect of this workout. It is set in Norway's Nord\u00e5svannet Bay, providing a natural and scenic outdoor environment, which is visually supported by the image. This outdoor setting adds an adventurous element, enhancing the exploratory vibe of the workout.\n\nBoth spirits are strongly present, contributing to a vigorous immersive experience in a stunning outdoor venue. Alternative spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are less relevant given the focus on high intensity and scenic adventure."
