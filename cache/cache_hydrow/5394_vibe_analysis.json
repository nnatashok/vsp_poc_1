  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Zen Flow' is chosen due to the Pilates nature of the workout, which is generally grounding and breath-centered. The music playlist includes artists like H.E.R. and Lewis Capaldi, which adds a calming and soothing atmosphere, supporting the unhurried and intentional qualities of this vibe. The high score of 0.8 is justified by these elements. \n\n'The Reboot Workout' is selected because the description mentions loosening up and refreshing the body, which aligns with the theme of a total-body refresh. The session is short and accessible, fitting well into the idea of a low-stress, rejuvenating workout. The 0.65 score reflects that it strongly fits this vibe. \n\nOther vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Foundation Builder' were considered but didn't fit due to the lack of a strong meditative focus or corrective exercise emphasis in the metadata."
