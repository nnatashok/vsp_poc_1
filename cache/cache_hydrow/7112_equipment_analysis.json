  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the category 'row,' which indicates that a rowing machine is essential for the cool-down session. The description explicitly states that participants will 'row with your eyes closed,' further supporting the requirement of a rowing machine. The title 'Closed Eyes Cool-Down' complements this information by suggesting a focus on a rowing-based cool-down activity. Given the strong emphasis on rowing in both the workout type and description, a high confidence score of 1.0 is assigned to the rowing machine requirement."
