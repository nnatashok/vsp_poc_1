  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Core Strength\" and categorized under \"On The Mat,\" indicating a routine likely performed on the floor, necessitating a mat for comfort and stability. Thus, a mat is required with very high confidence (1.0). Yoga blocks are mentioned as optional in the description, supporting some exercises, which gives them a moderate confidence level (0.4) as they are not central to the workout but may enhance certain movements. The image supports the presence of both a mat and blocks."
