  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Efficiency Row' features interval rowing with changing rhythms, which implies a repetitive and endurance-based nature, fitting 'The Meditative Grind' vibe (0.65). The use of upbeat songs like 'Party Rock Anthem' and 'DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love' contributes to an energized atmosphere that aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave' (0.7) as it builds a steady energy flow. The mention of rhythm changes and the pop mid radio station highlights a music-driven experience, making 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' relevant (0.6). Despite being an interval format, the intensity level is moderate, and the focus on rhythm over speed disqualifies more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter.' Overall confidence is 0.7 considering the clear indicators from music and workout description."
