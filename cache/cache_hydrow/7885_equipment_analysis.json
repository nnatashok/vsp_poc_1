  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata indicates that the workout is 'Post-Row Pilates,' which implies a focus on exercises following a rowing session. Thus, a 'Rowing machine' is needed with high confidence (0.8) since the workout is tailored for after rowing. The category 'On The Mat' and image showing a participant using a mat suggest that a 'Mat' is necessary for the exercises, supporting a very high confidence (0.9). The description mentions 'stretch your hips and hold a few planks,' which are typical Pilates exercises performed on a mat."
