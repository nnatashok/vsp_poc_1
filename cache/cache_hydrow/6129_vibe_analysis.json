  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Zen Flow' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is supported by the restorative nature of the workout and the serene location in Lucerne, Switzerland, suggesting a grounding and intentional practice. The mention of 'gently move and spend time in each pose' implies a slow and breath-centered flow typical of 'The Zen Flow'. The 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' music underscores a calming atmosphere.\n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Reboot Workout', assigned a score of 0.7. This is based on the restorative intent indicated in the description, as well as the calming music selection, supporting a low-stress, total-body refresh.\n\nThe third vibe, 'The Deep Recharge', is given a score of 0.6. This reflects the peaceful setting and gentle nature of the session, aligning with a nervous system reset.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' were excluded due to the short duration and focus on restoration rather than an extended, endurance-based practice."
