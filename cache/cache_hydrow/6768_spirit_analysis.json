  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is \"Soothing & Restorative,\" with a score of 0.85. This is evidenced by the focus on stretching and using a foam roller to target major back muscles. The workout location in Miami's outdoor setting adds an explorative element, but the calming, recovery-focused nature of the session clearly aligns with restorative practices. The use of dance and global hits music, though energizing, does not detract from the restorative aspects due to the session's emphasis on stretching and relaxation. \"Outdoor & Adventure\" receives a score of 0.3 due to the outdoor environment shown in the image, but the main focus remains on the restorative aspects."
