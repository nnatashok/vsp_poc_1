  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Self-Care Row' is centered around relaxation and self-care, evidenced by the phrase 'take time for yourself.' The soft pop music, including songs like 'A Thousand Miles' by Vanessa Carlton and 'All Of Me' by John Legend, further supports a calming and soothing atmosphere, aligning well with 'The Zen Flow' (0.8) vibe due to its grounding and intentional nature. The rowing format and 'breathe' tag suggest rhythmic and repetitive motions, characteristic of 'The Meditative Grind' (0.7). The low-intensity level and short duration make it a good fit for 'The Reboot Workout' (0.5), as it aligns with a session meant for refreshing and low-stress movement. The multiple indicators related to relaxation, calmness, and self-care justify high confidence in this classification."
