  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves high-intensity intervals on a rowing machine with a rhythm of 34+. The Technique Difficulty for rowing-based workouts is typically classified as Beginner or Intermediate. Given that this is a 'Drive' workout type and involves high rhythm, it aligns more closely with Intermediate due to the coordination required to maintain high rhythm pacing consistently. Also, the 'Drive' category typically indicates a more demanding rowing technique.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is over 21 minutes with high-intensity intervals, designed to hit high rhythms, indicating significant energy expenditure. Being marked as 'intensity level 3 out of 3' suggests a very demanding workout. However, considering the intended audience and rowing specificity, this is classified as 'Challenging', with a possibility of being 'Extreme' due to the sustained high intensity and minimal implied rest.",
