  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Vltava River Stern View,\" which clearly indicates an outdoor rowing session taking place on the Vltava River. This matches perfectly with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit because it involves experiencing natural surroundings and the historical scenery of Prague. The description further emphasizes this by mentioning 'historic sites' and a 'journey' along the river, reinforcing the exploration aspect typical for the Outdoor & Adventure spirit, which justifies a high score of 0.9. \nAdditionally, since this is a rowing workout categorized under 'journeys' and 'row', it is reasonable to associate a certain level of 'Flow & Rhythm,' as rowing typically involves rhythmic, continuous motion that aligns with this spirit. However, without specific information about music or emphasis on rhythm, the confidence and score remain moderate at 0.5. Other spirits such as High-Energy & Intense or Structured & Disciplined were excluded due to the focus on sightseeing and journeying rather than high intensity or strict structure."
