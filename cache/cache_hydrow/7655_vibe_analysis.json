  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Even Press + Stretch Cool-Down' primarily aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, scoring 0.8. This is due to its focus on a light stretch and cool-down, indicated by terms like \"cool down\" and the workout's categorization as such. The playlist includes calming tracks, further supporting this vibe. 'The Meditative Grind' receives a score of 0.6 since the rowing component involves focused repetition with a rhythm of 20, encouraging a meditative state. Lastly, 'The Zen Flow' scores 0.4 as the session includes a breath-centered, unhurried cool-down element, although the workout lacks the depth of intentionality typically seen in pure 'Zen Flow' sessions. The music genre being unspecified suggests a moderate confidence level, reinforced by the dance and global hits potentially adding an uplifting element."
