  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's total duration is 10 minutes and 43 seconds, which is relatively short, suggesting a relatively moderate expenditure. The circuit style, high energy from the instructor, and inclusion of 90-second rowing intervals indicate a sustained but accessible intensity. The manageable duration and focus on the upper body make the energy expenditure appropriate for a moderate level. This combination suits those looking to challenge themselves without high exhaustion, indicated by Moderate effort difficulty.",
