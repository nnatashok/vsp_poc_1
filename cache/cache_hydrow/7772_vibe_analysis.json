  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is designated as 'Peppy HIIT Row,' with a focus on high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which aligns with the 'The Firestarter' vibe, characterized by explosive and short intervals. The use of a popular music genre, namely 90s pop-punk and global hits, along with the upbeat songs like 'Smooth' and 'All The Small Things,' suggests an energetic and lively atmosphere, fitting the 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe, which involves high-energy music and a party-like atmosphere. The description of 'bringing energy' and 'along the shores of Hanover' hints at a more immersive and rhythm-driven approach, giving it a mild association with 'The Endorphin Wave,' which is about elevated, feel-good energy from steady rowing activity. Given the strong emphasis on music and energy, the confidence level is high, supported by explicit terms like 'energy,' 'HIIT,' and the choice of music tracks."
