  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Rock Row' is classified mainly as 'The Meditative Grind' and 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse'. The emphasis on 'Push yourself out of your comfort zone' along with the steady, repetitive nature of rowing aligns it with 'The Meditative Grind', evidenced by phrases like 'higher rhythms' and 'format: climb'. The use of rock music contributes to a motivating and rhythmic experience, fitting well with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse', characterized by the playlist including energetic classic rock tracks like 'Born to Be Wild'. The intensity level of 3 out of 3 suggests a challenging workout, supporting this classification. Other vibes were considered but excluded due to the lack of competitive, dance-based, or mindfulness-focused elements."
