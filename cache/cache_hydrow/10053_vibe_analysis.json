  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Confidence Building Row' is a HIIT session led by Mike Dostal, an accomplished rower with international competition experience. The description emphasizes building confidence and seems designed for advanced fitness users, indicating it may offer a sense of progression and challenge towards personal growth, relevant to 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, particularly because of its intensive and potentially rewarding nature. Dance high and Global Hits playlists suggest a rhythmic component that aligns with this vibe, contributing to its score of 0.75.\n\nThe title mentions 'Confidence Building', which can imply a steady, repetitive format typical of 'The Meditative Grind', though the intensity level and HIIT format suggest a less relaxed, more vigorous session, leading to a moderate score of 0.45 for this vibe.\n\nGiven Mike's competition background and the high-intensity level, 'The Competitor' vibe also seems fitting, as it likely incorporates gamified or highly strategic elements to challenge users, supported by the format and instructor's emphasis on technique and connection, warranting a score of 0.7.\n\nMusic genres are not specified, but 'Dance high' suggests an elevated rhythm, excluding calmer vibes such as 'Zen Flow' or 'Reboot Workout'. Overall confidence is 0.7 due to clear indications from the title, intensity, and format, although open details about specific music tracks contribute to mild uncertainty."
