  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 10:33 minutes is quite short, and the description 'quick and efficient' suggests a less demanding routine in terms of energy expenditure. The playlist includes high-energy music which might elevate the perceived effort, but overall, the program seems beginner-friendly based on length and inferred intensity. This supports a Light to Moderate classification for effort.",
