  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Androscoggin River Stern View' suggests an Outdoor & Adventure spirit, strongly indicated by the reference to the 'Androscoggin River' and the description highlighting a 'sunny day overlooking the tree-topped hills in Maine.' These elements emphasize a natural setting, which aligns with the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. The 'journey' category further supports this classification, as it implies exploration and movement in a scenic environment, typical of outdoor adventures. Although no specific rowing terms or intense training goals are mentioned, the context is clearly nature-based, which justifies a high score of 0.9 for the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. The lack of explicit indicators for other spirits and the primary outdoor context lead to a very high confidence level of 0.85 for this single spirit classification."
