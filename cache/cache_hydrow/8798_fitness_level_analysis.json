  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'drive' type, which on Hydrow typically requires more complex rowing technique and power application, aligning with Intermediate difficulty. The user fitness level requirement being Advanced suggests a high level of technical skill is beneficial, providing additional justification for considering advanced aspects of technique. However, Hydrow's specific categorization rules majorly rule for technique as Intermediate with a slight advanced tendency.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 'drive' workout with a maximum intensity level (3 out of 3) and 16-minute duration indicates high physical demand. The terms 'race' and 'drive' suggest intense rowing segments typical of challenging effort levels. Therefore, challenging effort fits due to the high speed and power demands over a non-extended duration.",
