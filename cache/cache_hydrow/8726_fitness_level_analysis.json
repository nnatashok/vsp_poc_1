  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'row' and 'drive,' indicating a focus on rowing techniques. In the context of rowing, the technique difficulty can only be 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate.' Key phrases such as 'proper form' and 'high-intensity intervals' suggest more coordination is needed, hence Beginner is at 0.8 and Intermediate is considered but with a score of 0.6.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 11:22 minutes, short but characterized by 'high-intensity intervals' indicating high energy expenditure, aligning more with 'Challenging.' The maximum rhythm is 32, which implies a vigorous effort level. Given the format 'HIIT,' Challenging is highly aligned, but due to the highest intensity rating (3 out of 3) and inclusion of 'drive,' part of Extreme is considered for highly intense bursts.",
