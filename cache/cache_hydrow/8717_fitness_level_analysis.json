  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is classified as 'drive', which according to Hydrow specific rules indicates advanced technique difficulty regardless of typical rowing classification. The presence of power intervals and high-intensity intervals suggests complex rowing techniques. Despite the row category typically aligning with beginner or intermediate classification, the 'drive' tag overrides this with advanced requirements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features power and high-intensity intervals across a 21-minute duration with a maximum rhythm of 34, indicating a high energy output and minimal rest. The intensity level being 3 out of 3 further supports a very demanding session, likely falling between challenging and extreme effort for those less conditioned, aligning more with extreme due to the high intensity and structured intervals.",
