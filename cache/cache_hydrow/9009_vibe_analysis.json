  "vibesExplanation": "The selected workout vibes for the 'Valentine's Day Row' are primarily 'The Meditative Grind' and 'The Endorphin Wave' due to the workout's steady, rhythm-focused nature and moderate intensity. The workout is described as building cardio with a steady rhythmic pace ('max rhythm: 24'), which aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' characterized by zoning in and repetitive motion. The focus on reflection during Valentine's Day stories suggests a contemplative, meditative quality.\n\nThe music from the '90's, Global Hits' implies a potentially uplifting, feel-good atmosphere, characteristic of 'The Endorphin Wave,' which is about elevated energy and a feel-good progression.\n\nWhile 'The Comfort Moves' does not exactly match the workout vibe, it captures the less intense aspect of this beginner-level workout (intensity level 1 out of 3), providing some alignment due to the easy, accessible nature of the session.\n\nThe absence of any mention of high intensity, technical skills, or competitive elements excludes other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.' Overall, the workout leans towards a meditative and slightly energized ambiance."
