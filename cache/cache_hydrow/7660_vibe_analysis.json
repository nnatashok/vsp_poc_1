  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, 'Double the Fun Row', involves rowing intervals, suggesting elements of 'The Meditative Grind' due to its repetitive, endurance-focused nature. High intensity (level 2 out of 3) and music choices ('Dance mid', 'Global Hits') imply elements of 'The Groove Session' through rhythmic, steady movement. The playlist includes upbeat tracks by artists like Calvin Harris and The Weeknd, which add an element of 'The Endorphin Wave', elevating energy and maintaining a feel-good vibe. The absence of specific high-intensity cues reduces the possibility of more explosive vibes like 'The Warrior Workout'. The confidence level remains moderately high (0.75) due to clear indicators from the music and rowing format."
