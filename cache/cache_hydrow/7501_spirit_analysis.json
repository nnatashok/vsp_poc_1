  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout has strong indicators of a High-Energy & Intense spirit, noted by keywords such as 'rev your engine,' 'tackle eight 1-minute intervals,' and 'intensity level: 3 out of 3,' highlighting a focus on intensity and pushing limits. The music playlist, featuring rock songs like 'Born To Be Wild,' further supports a high-energy atmosphere, adding to the workout's intensity.\n\nThe Outdoor & Adventure spirit is suggested by the image of rowing on a river, which aligns with nature-based settings providing an adventurous element. The outdoor environment amplifies the adventurous spirit as the participant rows amidst natural surroundings, fitting this theme as well."
