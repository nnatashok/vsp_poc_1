  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Activate Yourself Row,' and the description mentions 'warming up at a rhythm 22' and 'steadily row at a rhythm 26,' which clearly indicates a rowing exercise. Additionally, the category includes 'row,' strongly implying the use of a rowing machine. The image depicts people in a rowing activity, further supporting the need for this equipment. Based on these repeated references and the category type, there is very high confidence (1.0) that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
