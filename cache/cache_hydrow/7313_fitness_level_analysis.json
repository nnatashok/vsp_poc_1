  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', and therefore conforms to the guidelines that it can only be Beginner or Intermediate in technique difficulty. The designation 'Drive' implies a more dynamic and intensive rowing session, usually indicating the requirement for some technical coordination beyond the simplest movements, hence the Intermediate score of 0.8. Additionally, Olympic-level expertise of the trainer suggests movements could involve slightly complex coordination, strengthening Intermediate alignment.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format with a maximum rhythm of 30 and described as requiring 'all of your effort and power'. This indicates a significant level of exertion, typical of challenging workouts. Coupled with 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3' and 'short sprinting pieces', these elements align with the Extreme effort level. As HIIT workouts are energy-intensive, both Challenging and Extreme levels are feasible for deconditioned users, with Extreme scoring slightly higher at 0.7.",
