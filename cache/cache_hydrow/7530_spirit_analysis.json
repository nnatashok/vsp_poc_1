  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata and visual evidence suggest three predominant spirits for the 'Rock Row' workout. The 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is indicated by terms such as 'increase your rhythm and intensity' and the use of an interval format, which typically involves bursts of high effort ('sweat', 'max rhythm: 30'). This suggests a fast-paced workout with a focus on exertion. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is supported by the emphasis on music-driven rhythm ('turn up the music', 'steadily increase') and the curated playlist, which features energetic and rhythmic tracks that drive movement and coordination. Lastly, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is strongly supported by the rowing setting on a river, captured in the imagery. This natural setting reinforces the sense of exploration and connection with the environment, leading to a high confidence score. Other spirits, such as 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Soothing & Restorative', were not selected due to a lack of indicators in the metadata."
