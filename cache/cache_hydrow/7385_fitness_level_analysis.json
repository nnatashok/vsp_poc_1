Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is ranked primarily as 'Light' given the focus on mobility and a short duration (15:44) which suggests a workout with gentle stretches and movements. 'Moderate' has some alignment due to the description of 'total muscle engagement,' but lacking intensity cues like high energy consumption, it remains primarily a light-effort session.",
