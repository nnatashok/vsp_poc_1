  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as having a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the emphasis on interval training at a 'jog and run pace' with a max rhythm of 26, suggesting a continuous and coordinated movement. The music choice, including tracks by The Chainsmokers and Kygo, further supports a rhythm-driven experience. The high confidence in this classification (0.8) is based on the description and playlist.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is strongly represented, with the image clearly showing an outdoor rowing activity on a river. This aligns perfectly with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, earning a score of 0.9. The absence of an instructor and the setting imply a focus on exploration and natural connection. This is the dominant spirit due to the environmental context.\n\nThe workout's 'Breathe' category and low intensity level align less with 'High-Energy & Intense,' which was thus not selected. The overall spirit confidence is high at 0.85 due to clear visual and descriptive cues."
