  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's title 'Engagement Story Part 2 Row' and the category tags 'row' and 'standard' indicate that this is a rowing workout. The description mentions structured intervals, which are typical in rowing sessions. Despite the outdoor image suggesting actual water rowing, the context here refers to an indoor workout, aligning with the 'row' category type which necessitates a rowing machine. Therefore, the required equipment for this workout is a 'Rowing machine' with very high confidence (1.0), as it is central to the workout."
