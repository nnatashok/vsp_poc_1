  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for this rowing-based workout is classified as Beginner due to the nature of rowing, which primarily involves repetitive motion with moderate coordination requirements. As Hydrow's platform emphasizes rowing, the complexity of the form is generally more accessible, and the classification caps these workouts at Beginner or Intermediate. The metadata does not specify complex maneuvers, aligning with this classification, though it includes intervals which require some degree of coordination, thus also scoring Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is primarily Moderate due to the interval format and the workout duration of over 20 minutes, which suggests sustained physical activity requiring energy. The workout intensity level is medium (2 out of 3), highlighting a more demanding session than low-intensity activities, but it is not marked as the highest possible difficulty. The pacing (max rhythm of 30 with intense intervals) makes it slightly challenging for users with lower fitness levels, justifying also a smaller score under Challenging.",
