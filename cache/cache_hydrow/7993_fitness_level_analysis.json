  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a relatively long duration of 52:14 minutes, which indicates a higher energy expenditure over time. This, combined with the rowing modality, suggests a moderate to challenging effort due to the prolonged nature of the cardio activity. The lack of specified intensity cues or challenging variations in the description prevents a higher effort classification.",
