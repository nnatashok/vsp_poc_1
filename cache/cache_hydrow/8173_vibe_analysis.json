  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Reboot Workout' is chosen with high confidence due to the focus on 'Essential Stretches for Your Back,' highlighting a goal of tension release, ideal for refreshing and revitalizing. The activity type 'stretching' and use of a foam roller further support a restorative and low-stress workout. This matches the calming intention of a 'Reboot Workout.' 'The Zen Flow' vibe is selected with moderate confidence as the workout's description mentions 'Release tension' and occurs 'overlooking the Boston skyline,' suggesting an intentional, grounding, and breath-centered approach. The relaxing music playlist adds to this vibe. 'The Nature Flow' is included with lower confidence due to the outdoor setting with a scenic view, though the focus is more on stretching than rhythm. The music genre, a mix of Country and Global Hits, doesn't strongly indicate high energy or intensity, reinforcing a calming experience."
