  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'On The Mat', indicating a high likelihood of needing a mat for stretching exercises. The description mentions stretches for the back, which typically involve exercises performed on the floor, further supporting the need for a mat. Additionally, the image shows individuals standing on mats, confirming their use in this workout. Therefore, a mat is required with very high confidence (0.9). Other equipment is not mentioned or implied, so only the mat is needed."
