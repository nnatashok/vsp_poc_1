  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Power + Quickness Warm-Up' with a focus on rhythm and power implies elements of steady, rhythmic motion, fitting 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The use of terms like 'rhythm' and 'power' along with a rowing activity in a scenic setting suggests a methodical experience, thus getting a score of 0.7. This is further supported by the warm-up nature and the climbing format, which aligns with sustained repetitive efforts common in meditative grinds.\n\nThe music choice, featuring tracks by The Roots and The Fugees with a pop mid/global hits radio genre, injects a positive and motivating energy, hinting at an 'Endorphin Wave' vibe. This music selection elevates the workout's mood, scoring a 0.6. The mix of familiar tracks and mid-tempo beats could enhance the enjoyable nature of the exercise, helping sustain endurance.\n\nOverall, the workout is less about explosive intensity and more about rhythmic power increase, making these vibes the most applicable."
