  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe of this workout strongly aligns with 'The Masterclass Workout' due to the emphasis on technique and connection between legs and core, as well as its 'technique-focused' description. This suggests a focus on skill-building, earning it a high score of 0.8.\n\n'\"The Meditative Grind\" is another fitting vibe. The moderate rhythm and endurance nature of rowing, along with its categorization as standard rowing, match well with a zone-in, repetitive experience, supported by a 0.7 score.\n\nLastly, 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' is suggested due to the beat-driven soundtrack, full of dance and global hits, which indicates a music-infused workout. This element adds a layer of rhythm to the technique and form, aligning moderately with the vibe, thus a 0.6 score.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Groove Session' or 'The Endorphin Wave' were excluded due to the absence of explicit dance or endurance challenges."
