Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, lasting 16 minutes as a 'journey', suggests a focus on steady-state rowing with no indication of high intensity or variable efforts likely found in more advanced rowing workouts. Given its primary Journey category and absence of explicitly high-intensity descriptors, energy expenditure remains manageable, likely resulting in light effort, suitable for beginners. However, to accommodate the indicated range of fitness levels up to Advanced, and to account for moderate effort due to sustained activity, we allocate a secondary Moderate level score of 0.3.",
