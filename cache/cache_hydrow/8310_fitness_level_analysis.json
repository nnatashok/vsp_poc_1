Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is relatively short, at 10 minutes and 30 seconds, with a \"journey\" type indicating a more relaxed, sightseeing experience rather than an intense fitness session. Therefore, the exercise can be completed with low-to-moderate energy output for deconditioned users. A score of 0.6 is assigned for Light efforts, considering gentle, continuous movement with minimal exertion. The Moderate level is less strongly aligned, scoring 0.4, reflecting some effort challenges for less fit individuals.",
