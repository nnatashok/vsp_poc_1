  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Flow + Restore for New Years' suggests a calming, rejuvenating session through yoga flow and relaxation. The use of 'restore' and 'rejuvenated' in the description strongly aligns with 'The Zen Flow,' characterized by grounding and intentional movements. The playlist's chill and downtempo music, featuring artists like Thievery Corporation and Gramatik, further supports this vibe, offering a relaxing atmosphere. The optional inclusion of yoga blocks and a blanket reinforces a meditative, relaxed approach.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Deep Recharge' is relevant due to the restorative nature of the workout, aiming for a nervous system reset through ultra-gentle movements. The focus on relaxation and rejuvenation matches the objectives behind 'The Deep Recharge.'\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' were considered but discounted due to the emphasis on relaxation over repetitive endurance. The absence of instructor-led intensity guides the decision towards more calming vibes."
