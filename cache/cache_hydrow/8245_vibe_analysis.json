  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, \"Fog + Castles Row,\" focuses on a technique-centered experience, suggesting a calm, meditative emphasis. The title and description highlight an immersive experience with mentions of fog, castles, and swans, which evoke a soothing, scenic atmosphere, aligning with \"The Zen Flow.\" The music playlist includes pop and global hits, with softer artists like Marshmello and Ed Sheeran, contributing to a balanced and uplifting vibe, characteristic of \"The Endorphin Wave.\" The session's intervals format and low intensity suggest a steady, repetitive nature fitting \"The Meditative Grind,\" where the focus is on rhythm and technique. The calm setting and moderate music intensity support a peaceful but engaging workout, suitable for achieving a meditative state while maintaining a gentle energy build-up. The absence of high intensity or competitive elements makes other vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Competitor\" less applicable."
