  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Reverse Climb Cool-Down' is classified as 'The Reboot Workout' with a strong score of 0.8 due to its focus on gradually decreasing rhythm and heart rate, indicative of a low-stress, total-body refresh. The cool-down format and category explicitly support this vibe. 'The Meditative Grind' is assigned a score of 0.6, supported by the repetitive element of rowing along the Charles River, inviting a meditative experience. The playlist consists of calm, recognizable tracks, suggesting a contemplative atmosphere that fits 'The Zen Flow,' though with a milder score of 0.4 due to the slightly less explicit focus on grounding and breath work. The lack of high-intensity elements and the calming riverside setting further influence these vibe choices."
