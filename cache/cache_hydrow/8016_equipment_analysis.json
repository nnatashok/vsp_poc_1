  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout 'Commit to Fit: Celebration Row' clearly indicates the use of rowing in its title, and the category includes 'row,' which mandates the requirement of a 'Rowing machine' with very high confidence. The description further enforces this by mentioning the commitment to 'hop on your Hydrow,' which is a specific brand of rowing machine. As such, a rowing machine is essential for performing this workout effectively."
