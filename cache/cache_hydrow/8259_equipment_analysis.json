  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout name 'Prague Challenge Row' explicitly includes the term 'Row,' indicating the necessity of rowing equipment. The workout type is 'row' and 'drive,' which are strongly associated with rowing exercises. Additionally, the category 'row' confirms that this is a rowing workout. Therefore, a rowing machine would be essential to perform this workout effectively. The high intensity level (3 out of 3) further implies that specialized equipment like a rowing machine is crucial for exerting maximum effort. The image provided also supports this classification, as it shows a person rowing on water, reinforcing the need for rowing capability. Thus, the confidence score for the rowing machine is set at 0.9."
