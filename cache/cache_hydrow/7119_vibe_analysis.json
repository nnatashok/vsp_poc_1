  "vibesExplanation": "The workout has a strong focus on form and progression ('legs-only progressions'), aligning well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to the repetitive and focused nature of rowing. The 'Masterclass Workout' vibe is also relevant given the technique emphasis ('Focus on your form with James') and format ('Technique'). The combination of these elements suggests methodical skill-building, justifying a strong relevance score.\n\nThe playlist consisting of Indie Alternative and Global Hits ('No Good,' 'Bright Lights') provides a steady, motivational backdrop, indicating a moderate match for 'The Endorphin Wave,' characterized by feel-good and energy-elevating movements.\n\nThe workout\u2019s intensity level (2 out of 3) and duration (21 minutes) support these vibes. The absence of an explosive intensity or high-speed challenge lowers the relevance for more dynamic vibes like 'The Warrior Workout.' The confidence level is relatively high at 0.75 due to clear evidence in metadata."
