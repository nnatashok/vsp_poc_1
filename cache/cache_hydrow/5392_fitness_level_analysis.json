  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of about 16 minutes, the session is relatively short. It primarily involves static holds and slow transitions between the poses, typical of yoga classes that emphasize alignment. These factors contribute to a moderate energy expenditure level, suitable for beginners or those at an intermediate fitness level. The music used, described as 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo,' further suggests a pace that is not too demanding, aligning with light to moderate effort.",
