  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is categorized under 'row', which, according to Hydrow-specific rules, suggests a technique difficulty between Beginner and Intermediate. The intervals climbing to rhythms of 24, 26, and 28 involve basic to moderately complex rowing techniques. Given the emphasis on maintaining a consistent split, a hint of coordination needed is indicated, but it predominantly remains a rowing session, which commonly does not exceed Intermediate difficulty. The presence of a seasoned instructor like Mike can contribute slightly toward better technique, supporting a mix leaning heavier towards Beginner.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is influenced by the 'sweat' workout type, 16.5-minute duration, and the intensity level of 2 out of 3. The interval format with increasing rhythms up to 28 indicates bursts of effort accompanied by periods of relative rest, suggesting more energy expenditure than light cardio but not quite reaching extreme levels. The context suggests a balanced workout that would be notably demanding for someone in poor shape. Thus, the workout aligns between Moderate and Challenging, slightly weighted towards Moderate",
