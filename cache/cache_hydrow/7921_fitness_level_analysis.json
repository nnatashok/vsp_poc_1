  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 30 minutes, which is moderate and can be somewhat challenging for beginners or deconditioned users, particularly since it involves rowing which engages multiple muscle groups. However, the 'journey' type might imply a focus on steady-state rowing rather than high-intensity intervals, suggesting a lower intensity than typical circuit rowing. Hence, the effort level is primarily Moderate with some aspects edging towards Challenging for less fit users.",
