  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Whole Body Stretch' session focusing on releasing tension and increasing flexibility, which typically involves exercises performed on a mat. The phrase 'On The Mat' in the category strongly suggests the use of a mat, leading to a high confidence score of 0.8. Additionally, the description explicitly states that a 'long resistance band is recommended,' reinforcing the need for resistance bands with the same confidence level of 0.8. The image further confirms the presence of a mat and what appears to be a resistance band placed next to it. Therefore, the identified equipment for this workout includes a mat and resistance bands."
