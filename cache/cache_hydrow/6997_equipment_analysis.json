  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout name 'Post-Row Mobility' suggests this session is intended for recovery following a rowing workout, which implies the need for a 'Rowing machine' even though it might not be actively used during the session. Therefore, it is listed with a high confidence score of 0.7. The category 'On The Mat' and the visual depiction of participants on mats in the attached image strongly indicate the use of a 'Mat' for this session, leading to a very high confidence score of 0.9 for the mat. The description focuses on mobility, which is often performed on a mat for exercises targeting back and hip flexibility. No other equipment is mentioned or implied."
