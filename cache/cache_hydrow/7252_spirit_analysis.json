  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Shifting Gears Row' is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to its focus on 'max effort intervals' and the description of the workout intensity as '3 out of 3,' indicating a challenging session. The use of rock music further supports the high-energy classification. Additionally, the workout includes 'Outdoor & Adventure' elements, as evidenced by the visual of rowing on a river at Newport Beach, which fits the natural, outdoor setting criterion. The title 'Shifting Gears' and the mention of rhythm shifts imply a 'Flow & Rhythm' aspect, making this another relevant spirit, though secondary, due to the emphasis on structured intensity. Overall, the strong indicators of intensity and outdoor setting lead to high-confidence scores for their respective spirits."
