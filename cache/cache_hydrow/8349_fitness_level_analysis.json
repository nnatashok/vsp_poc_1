  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercise's description as a rowing workout inherently limits the technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate levels based on platform rules. The mention of 'sprint pace at varying rhythms' suggests a modest level of coordination and technique but does not exceed the Intermediate threshold. Given that rowing is a foundational exercise with generally manageable movement patterns, the workout is classified with a high confidence in Beginner technique difficulty, with a lower score for Intermediate due to varying rhythms requiring some coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 11:18 minutes and the focus on 'sprint pace at varying rhythms' in a 'power-focused session' support a classification of Moderate effort. The session described as a 'sweat' type along with an intensity level 2 out of 3 indicates the workout is more than Light but not at a high intensity, justifying the higher weighting towards Moderate. There is some additional energy demand implied by the word 'power,' lending a lower weight for Challenging.",
