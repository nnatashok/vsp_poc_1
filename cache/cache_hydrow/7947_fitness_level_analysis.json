  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing session ('row') labeled with a 'breathe' category, which typically involves a lower intensity and focus on form rather than technical complexity. The 'Shortened Slide' technique suggests a focus on specific rowing form, which might slightly elevate complexity to Intermediate, but it remains Beginner-friendly due to its alignment with 'Prioritize your form,' indicating accessible technique expectations. Hence, a high confidence in Beginner classification with a slight nod to Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity level is 1 out of 3, which translates to a light effort demand. The focus on steady rhythm and 'breathe' workout type aligns with a calming, low-intensity session. The short duration (approximately 21 minutes) further supports this, suggesting the workout is suitable for maintaining effort without exertion. While 'shortened slide' demands some quickness, the overall effort remains predominately Light, with a slight Moderate alignment due to the rhythmic component.",
