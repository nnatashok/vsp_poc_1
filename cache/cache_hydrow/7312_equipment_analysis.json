  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is a 'Whole Body Pilates' session with a category of 'On The Mat,' strongly indicating the use of a mat for exercises. The description references pilates, which traditionally involves exercises performed on a mat to support and cushion the body. The image further confirms this, as two individuals are seen standing on mats. Thus, a mat is highly likely to be required, justifying a high confidence score of 0.9."
