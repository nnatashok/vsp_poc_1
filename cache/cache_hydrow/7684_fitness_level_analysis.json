  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized with 'drive' and involves high-intensity rowing at max rhythm 32+, indicating a more technical rowing requirement. Given this complexity, the Technique Difficulty is primarily 'Advanced' (score: 0.9), aligning with Hydrow-specific rules. The 'Intermediate' level (score: 0.7) also applies because while the rhythm is high, it doesn't involve complex equipment or movement patterns beyond rowing, thus serving multiple fitness levels inclusively.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is 'Challenging' (score: 0.85) due to the short duration that emphasizes high-intensity effort aimed at achieving maximum meters. The Workout Intensity Level is 3 out of 3, suggesting a high energy expenditure. The 'Extreme' level (score: 0.75) is plausible considering the format 'Power' and rhythm, although the short duration slightly mitigates this.",
