  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of 15:14 minutes, which is relatively short and indicative of a lower intensity session. As this is a 'journey' type row with no explicit intensity markers, it suggests a pace suited for exploring and enjoying the view, aligning with Light to Moderate effort difficulty. This suits users who enjoy a leisurely pace rather than a high-intensity row.",
