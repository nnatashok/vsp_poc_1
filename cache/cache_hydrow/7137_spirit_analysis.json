  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Learn and Burn Row\" is identified primarily with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit due to its setting on the Rio Guadalquivir in Seville. The outdoor environment, combined with the aspect of 'cruising down' the river mentioned in the description, strongly aligns with exploration and engaging with nature, earning it a high score of 0.8.\n\nThe secondary spirit is \"Flow & Rhythm,\" scoring 0.6. This is indicated by the inclusion of music-driven rhythms such as those from Stromae, Imagine Dragons, and other artists, facilitating a connection between movement and music. The use of the term \"cruise\" also suggests a smooth, flowing motion that is rhythmically engaging.\n\nThe intensity level 2 and the lack of high-paced descriptions lower the likelihood of a \"High-Energy & Intense\" classification, and the structured aspect of intervals aligns less with a purely structured protocol, making the \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit less applicable here. The workout does not focus on recovery, nor does it specify sport-specific skills, thus excluding \"Soothing & Restorative\" and \"Sport & Agility\" spirits."
