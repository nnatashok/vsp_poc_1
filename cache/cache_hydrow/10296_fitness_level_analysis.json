  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which limits the maximum technique difficulty to Intermediate. The description indicates a 'Sweat' session with a 'climb' format, suggesting a focus on endurance rather than complex movements. The emphasis on an introspective journey rather than technical coaching further supports a Beginner technique classification. While there's a slight possibility of intermediate coordination due to the rhythmic aspect, overall, the technique difficulty aligns strongly with Beginner level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 16-minute duration and a workout intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicate a moderate effort requirement. The 'Sweat' category implies a focus on maintaining a sustained effort, potentially pushing it towards a Challenging level for less fit users. However, considering the relatively short duration and focus on the motivational aspect, the effort level is most aligned with Moderate.",
