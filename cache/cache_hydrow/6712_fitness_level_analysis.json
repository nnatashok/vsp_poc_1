  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is of short duration, 10 minutes and 51 seconds, typically indicating lower energy expenditure. As it's described as a 'quick workout', suggests a session that is not overly intense, aligning strongly with a 'Light' effort level. Pilates tends to focus on muscle endurance and core strengthening rather than intense cardiovascular exertion, reinforcing the 'Light' categorization. However, some core-engaging movements potentially elevate it to a 'Moderate' effort for beginners, justifying a slight inclusion at a lower score. Overall, the session is tailored not to overwhelm participants, making it mostly light in effort.",
