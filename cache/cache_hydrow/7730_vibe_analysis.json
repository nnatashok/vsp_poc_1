  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled '80s Intervals Row,' which suggests an energetic and rhythmic vibe due to the all-80s playlist. The presence of upbeat songs by artists like Dolly Parton and Wham! aligns with 'The Nightclub Workout' due to its euphoric, music-centric nature, earning a score of 0.7. The structure of short intervals at max rhythm 30, and a 21-minute duration points to 'The Meditative Grind,' as it implies repetition and endurance, matching zone-focused workouts like rowing, resulting in a score of 0.6. Additionally, the moderate intensity level and feel-good tracks contribute to 'The Endorphin Wave,' as the workout seems to build energy steadily while maintaining an enjoyable flow, giving it a score of 0.5. The use of popular 80s hits enhances the fun and lively atmosphere, attracting individuals who enjoy upbeat, nostalgia-driven experiences but does not strongly correspond to any high-intensity or power-oriented vibes."
