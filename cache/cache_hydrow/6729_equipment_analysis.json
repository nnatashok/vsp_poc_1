  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as 'Power Yoga Flow' and categorized under 'On The Mat', indicating a yoga practice typically performed on a mat. The description explicitly mentions that 'Yoga blocks recommended,' which suggests that blocks are an optional but beneficial addition. The image shows a mat and yoga blocks, which supports the need for these items. Consequently, the confidence scores are high: 0.9 for the mat, as it's essential for comfort and safety during the practice, and 0.7 for the blocks, given their recommendation and presence in the image."
