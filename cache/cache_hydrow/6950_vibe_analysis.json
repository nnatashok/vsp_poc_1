  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled \"Express Bodyweight Strength\" with the description highlighting a \"quick pace\" suggests elements of a fun, time-efficient routine. The use of 80s hits such as 'Hungry Like The Wolf' and 'Jessie's Girl' suggests a lively and energetic environment, characteristic of 'The Groove Session,' which is identified with being fun and fluid, resulting in a score of 0.75.\n\nThe workout's repeating structure with bodyweight exercises without equipment fits 'The Meditative Grind,' with its focus on repetition and zoning in, scored at 0.65.\n\nLastly, the popular 80's music infuses 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe as it involves elements of euphoria and rhythm-driven movement, albeit not in a conventional dance sense, scoring 0.60. The short duration and structured exercises slightly reduce confidence in the nightclub vibe. Overall confidence is moderate at 0.7, given the clear indicators from music and pace."
