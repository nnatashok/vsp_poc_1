  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is aptly classified with a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the rowing session being conducted on the blue waters of Prince William Sound, a natural outdoor setting. The title 'Prince William Sound Bow View' and the description emphasize the outdoor journey aspect, with a focus on movement through a natural environment. This aligns perfectly with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, justifying a high score of 0.95. Additionally, there is an element of 'Flow & Rhythm' suggested by the continuous rowing journey aspect over significant duration '00:21:20', which implies a rhythmic, sustained effort. However, without specific musical or pace information, the score for 'Flow & Rhythm' is more moderate, at 0.5. No indicators of high intensity, structured discipline, recovery focus, or sports specificity are present, thus these spirits are excluded from consideration."
