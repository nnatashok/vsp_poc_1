  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Club 18 Row' strongly aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' because of its focus on maintaining a consistent rhythm of 18 strokes per minute over a 21-minute duration. The emphasis on 'big power at low speeds' suggests a repetitive, endurance-focused session. This long, steady format with a moderate intensity level complements the meditative and enduring vibe. The playlist featuring rock and global hits injects some energy, helping endorphins create a motivating backdrop, thus incorporating elements of 'The Endorphin Wave,' though not as dominant. This mix of steady rhythm and energizing music creates a powerful yet calm workout environment, justifying the chosen vibes and scores. The absence of more explosive or varied intensity reduces the likelihood of other vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.'"
