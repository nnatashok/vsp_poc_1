  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is a 'drive' and 'row', which typically involves complex but accessible rowing techniques. Given the description of building power with run pace intervals and max pace blasters, the exercises demand coordination and control but are within an intermediate level. The rowing activity and interval format suggest a structured technique requiring some skill, aligning with Intermediate difficulty fully.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity level is 3 out of 3, indicating high physical demand. The intervals of '2-minute power at run pace' and 'max pace for 30\" blasters' are indicative of short bursts of high effort, typical of a challenging intensity for deconditioned users. The duration of 21:34 is moderate, but the interval nature and intensity level suggest significant physical effort, aligning strong-to-extreme challenging difficulty.",
