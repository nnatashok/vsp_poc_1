  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Yoga Align for the Spine' emphasizes 'stability and stillness', which aligns with 'The Zen Flow', suggesting a grounding, breath-centered experience. The music genre, described as 'chill low' and 'cool/downtempo', further supports this calming, intentional vibe. The description's mention of tension release and spine lengthening suggests elements of 'The Reboot Workout', focusing on refreshment and gentle stretching. The 11-minute duration implies a short session, reinforcing these vibes. Overall, 'The Zen Flow' is a stronger match due to the focus on calmness and alignment, but 'The Reboot Workout' also applies due to its restorative elements."
