  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for 'Rainy Cardio Row' aligns strongly with the Beginner level due to its classification under 'row' and 'breathe' workout type. Rowing generally requires less technical skills compared to other high-skill exercises, and is beginner-friendly. Although there is an element of rhythm change which could introduce a moderate complexity, it remains largely accessible. The user requirement being Beginner further reinforces this alignment. The Intermediate score is given due to the interval format which might involve some coordination in adjusting rhythm, though it's simplified by the clear structure provided by the instructors.",
