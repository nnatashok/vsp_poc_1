  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout category 'row' predominantly aligns with the 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate' classification for technique difficulty. Additionally, the instructor's focus on proper form supports the potential for beginner accessibility, despite the fast pace. Given the inclusion of high-intensity intervals, a small score for Intermediate is warranted, but overall, there is a strong alignment with a Beginner level for technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'high-intensity intervals' with a max rhythm of 28, placing it within a Medium to High effort range. The duration of 11:30 suggests it is not too lengthy, but the focus on intensity implies it goes beyond 'Moderate'. The workout intensity level of 2 out of 3 further indicates it is significantly effortful, leading to a Moderate score of 0.6 and Challenging at 0.4.",
