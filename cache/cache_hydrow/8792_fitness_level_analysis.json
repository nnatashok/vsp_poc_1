However, considering the user's physical limitations, we adjust this to include Beginner (0.6) and predominantly Intermediate (0.9) scores due to the high-intensity format and demands of maintaining correct form during rapid transitions in interval training.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves high-intensity intervals with maximum rhythm set to 30, indicating very demanding effort that requires maintaining vigorous activity across varying durations (30-, 45-second, and 1-minute intervals). The workout duration is relatively short at 11:32 minutes but packs high intensity as guided by the advanced intensity level (3 out of 3). This indicates a predominantly Extreme (0.9) effort difficulty, with a Challenging aspect (0.7) due to possible fatigue for less conditioned users.",
