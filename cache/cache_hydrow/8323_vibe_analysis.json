  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Steady Cool-Down' and explicitly classified as a cool down in both the description and type, suggesting a gentle, relaxing session. The duration is short (about 6 minutes), indicating a session focused on recovery and relaxation. Music plays a key role in shaping the vibe, with 'Pop low' and 'Global Hits' stations likely providing a calming auditory backdrop, especially with songs like 'Drift Away' by Dobie Gray. The use of phrases like 'catch your breath and stretch' in the description further emphasizes relaxation and unwinding. Thus, 'The Reboot Workout' is a strong match given its focus on low stress and total-body refresh, while 'The Zen Flow' is also selected for its gentle, breath-centered qualities. The confidence level is moderately high due to clear indicators of a relaxing, cooldown-focused vibe, with a slight uncertainty due to lack of specifics in music genre and exercise details."
