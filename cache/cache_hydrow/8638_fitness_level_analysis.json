Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is over 30 minutes, which suggests a moderate to challenging effort level for less fit users. Since it is a 'journey' type, it implies steady rowing with no high-intensity cues, leading to a primary classification of Moderate effort (0.8). The extended duration also justifies the inclusion of the Challenging level (0.5), as continuous activity over half an hour can be taxing for beginners.",
