  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the structured pacing described as 'Row at a rhythm 22' and '10-stroke blasters at a rhythm 26'. This rhythmic approach, combined with music playlists featuring pop and global hits, indicates a strong connection between movement and music.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is supported by the visual context, which shows rowing on a river with beautiful outdoor scenery. This aspect aligns with the spirit focusing on nature-based workouts using the environment for challenges and exploration.\n\nThe 'Cardio Boost Row' with an intensity level of 1 out of 3 does not emphasize high intensity enough to strongly match the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. Therefore, 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are the most fitting spirits, with 'Outdoor & Adventure' being slightly more emphasized due to the outdoor setting."
