  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as a Drive workout type in rowing, which traditionally suggests more technical form and skill compared to basic rowing. Though typically Technique Difficulty for row workouts caps at Intermediate, the label 'Drive' implies some complexity requiring a coordinated effort, justifying a strong Intermediate classification with high confidence. The workout also uses interval training, which requires precise pacing and technique adaptation.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout presents a high effort level due to its 21-minute duration and interval format, especially with maximum rhythms reaching 30+, demanding physical intensity. The 'Drive' nature implies a higher energy expenditure. With a workout intensity of 3 out of 3, this classification suggests significant physical demand consistent with a 'Challenging' rating, strongly aligned with the metadata indicators.",
