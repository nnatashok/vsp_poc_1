This aligns well with 'The Competitor' vibe, typically involving full-send energy similar to rowing races, which aligns with a score of 0.75.\n\nThe mention of a consistent rhythm and the music genres like 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits' suggest a steady build of energy, fitting 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe that focuses on an elevated energy feel-good movement, justifying a score of 0.7. \n\nAdditionally, the nature of rowing with an emphasis on rhythm and repetition supports 'The Meditative Grind,' where the workout allows one to zone in and let repetition take over.
