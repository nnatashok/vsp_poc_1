  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' (score: 0.8) due to its focus on gentle hip-opening movements and mobility, as described in the title and description. The use of optional yoga blocks suggests a gentle, supportive approach typical of restorative practices. The absence of intense language or indicators of high exertion further reinforces this spirit.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is considered as a secondary spirit (score: 0.4) because, while the music genre includes Dance mid and Global Hits, suggesting rhythm, the primary focus on mobility and the lack of a strong musical or flow-driven component in the metadata limit its presence. The playlist features artists known for more ambient or melodic tracks like R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL, which can support a rhythmic flow element.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' are not applicable here due to the indoor setting and the gentle nature of the workout."
