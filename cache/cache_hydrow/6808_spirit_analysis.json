  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.9 due to the description's emphasis on a 'Hip-Opening Flow' and the use of chill music genres, which suggest a smooth and continuous movement pattern. The description's use of the word 'gently' aligns with a focus on rhythm and coordination rather than intensity.\n\nAdditionally, the setting at the 'Royal Palm Estate in Miami' and the visual evidence of being outdoors indicates an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, scoring 0.8. The presence of natural surroundings and the exercise conducted on a mat in a scenic environment support this classification.\n\nNo elements suggest a particularly high energy or intense workout, nor do they indicate structured and disciplined protocols, soothing and restorative focus, or sport-specific agility goals, leading to their exclusion from consideration. The confidence is high at 0.85 due to explicit context clues from both the environment and activity type."
