  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, as indicated by the title 'Power Yoga Flow' and the description which emphasizes a 'faster paced power flow accessible to all levels.' The use of yoga blocks suggests a focus on fluid movement. The music playlist, featuring remix tracks and downtempo genres, supports this focus on rhythm and flow, justifying a high score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the workout setting appears to be outdoors, as seen in the image with the instructor positioned near a waterfront. This setting ties into an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the natural, open environment, though it is secondary to the primary flow spirit, warranting a score of 0.6. While the video is classified as 'On The Mat,' the outdoor setting is significant enough to influence the spirit categorization.\n\nOther potential spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the absence of specific indicators of high intensity or strict regimen in the metadata."
