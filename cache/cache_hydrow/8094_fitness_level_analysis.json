  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout type 'drive,' which Hydrow defines as potentially more challenging rowing workouts, this session likely involves advanced rowing techniques. As the category is 'row,' the Technique Difficulty is restricted to either Beginner or Intermediate. With a high rhythm of 32 strokes per minute and the focus on 'Power,' the row involves some coordination and skill but remains within the Intermediate range. The description and context around this being a 'Drive' workout further reinforce the Intermediate category.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The high intensity level (3 out of 3) and focus on maintaining a high rhythm for maximum meters indicate significant physical demand. The ten-minute duration, while not exceptionally long, is conducted at a high rhythm of 32 SPM ('Power' focus), indicating high energy expenditure and effort. The 'Drive' categorization and intense music selection further suggest a workout that requires substantial effort, aligning with the 'Extreme' classification, especially for less fit users.",
