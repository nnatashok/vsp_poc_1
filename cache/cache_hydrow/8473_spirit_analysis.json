  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title 'Advanced Whole Body Circuit' and the format 'EMOM' (Every Minute on the Minute) suggest a high level of intensity and exertion, which aligns with a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The explicit lyrics and rock mid-intensity music further support a high-energy atmosphere, leading to a score of 0.8 for this spirit.\n\nThe workout involves '1-minute intervals' and the mention of 'circuit' training implies a structured format typical of 'Structured & Disciplined' sessions. The use of dumbbells indicates strength training components that are often associated with structured and systematically planned workouts. These elements justify a score of 0.7 for the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to the lack of indicators such as flow, rhythm, or recovery focus associated with 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits. The environment and focus of this workout do not match 'Outdoor & Adventure' or 'Sport & Agility' spirits."
