  "vibesExplanation": "The workout's structure and music selection strongly guide the vibe categorization. The interval format combined with a rowing focus suggests repetitive, endurance-driven action, aligning with \"The Meditative Grind,\" scoring a 0.7. The rhythmic climb and emphasis on maintaining a goal split also support this classification. Additionally, the use of upbeat indie and global hits, combined with the moderate intensity and relatively short duration, suggest an uplifting, steady progression corresponding to \"The Endorphin Wave\" with a score of 0.6. The lack of specified high-intensity cues or competitive elements excludes vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Competitor.\" The presence of motivating music, paired with the interval structure brings both a grinding and joyful fitness experience."
