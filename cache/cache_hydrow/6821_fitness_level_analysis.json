  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a relatively short duration of 5 minutes and no specified intensity or high-energy elements, indicating low energy expenditure. This strongly aligns with the Light effort difficulty (0.9). While rowing slightly elevates the basal effort level, potentially pushing it towards a Moderate level (0.4), the brief duration supports the dominant Light classification.",
