  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'row' and described as an 'Endurance Pyramid,' suggesting variable intensity requires some rowing technique, yet it remains accessible. As a 'breathe' type with a user fitness level requirement of Beginner, the movements are likely straightforward. Although the involvement of an Olympic rower implies advanced techniques, this aspect is not the session's focus. The Beginner rating aligns strongly with accessible rhythm and technique cues, earning a 0.9 score, while minor complexity in coordination justifies a weaker Intermediate score of 0.3.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 16 minutes and a max rhythm of 24, the workout is designed for sustained, somewhat challenging physical engagement, but the total length and intensity suggest accessibility. The description of 'holding a sustained effort' and an intensity rating of 1 out of 3 suggest a requirement for steady but not strenuous exertion, leading to a moderate effort difficulty alignment at 0.6. The inclusion of popular, easy-listening songs also supports a subdued workout energy, meriting a 0.5 in the light category.",
