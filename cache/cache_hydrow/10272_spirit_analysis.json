  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Lane Cove River Stern View' workout is classified primarily as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a spirit score of 0.95. This strong classification is supported by the title and description that both emphasize the natural setting of the Lane Cove River, a key indicator of an Outdoor & Adventure spirit. The words 'Immerse yourself in the tranquil beauty' suggest an exploration of nature, aligning with the spirit's focus on leveraging terrain and environmental challenges. Additionally, the term 'journey' in the workout type further suggests a focus on exploration and outdoor elements. \n\nThe secondary classification of 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.55 is due to the emphasis on tranquility and serenity in the description. The tranquil setting implies a potential element of relaxation and stress reduction, typical of Soothing & Restorative workouts. \n\nThe lack of intensity markers ruled out 'High-Energy & Intense', while absence of structured goals or sport-specific training excluded 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Sport & Agility' spirits."
