  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is described as a stretching session for hips, legs, and ankles after running, emphasizing recovery, relaxation, and restorative practices. This clearly fits within the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit, with a high confidence score of 0.8 due to its focus on post-run recovery.\n\nAdditionally, the location of the session, overlooking Dublin in an outdoor setting, aligns with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. The inclusion of natural surroundings and the outdoor mat category contributes to this classification, assigning it a score of 0.7. \n\nThe use of \"dance mid\" and \"global hits\" music, while energetic, does not provide enough intensity to warrant a \"High-Energy & Intense\" classification, and no elements indicate the \"Sport & Agility\" or \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirits. The music might enhance a rhythmic flow, but the primary focus is on stretching and recovery."
