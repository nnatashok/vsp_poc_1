  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which inherently restricts the technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate levels as per Hydrow-specific rules. The description mentions maintaining consistent effort with a focus on rhythms between 20 to 24, implying some level of rhythm control which could suggest an Intermediate level for untrained individuals. However, since the workout is beginner-rated, a higher score is assigned to Beginner level, reflecting its accessibility.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is moderate at 21 minutes, which could lead to a higher effort for deconditioned users. The interval format with rhythm changes suggests some intensity. However, with an intensity rating of 1 out of 3 and a focus on maintaining consistency rather than peak exertion, most of the effort is aligned with Light difficulty, though some users might find it Moderately challenging due to rhythm shifts.",
