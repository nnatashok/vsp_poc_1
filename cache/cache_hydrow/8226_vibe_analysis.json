  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'cool-down' with a duration of about 6 minutes. This aligns well with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which emphasizes deep stretch and low-stress activity. The Halloween theme suggests a light-hearted, fun approach, but primarily, the emphasis is on relaxation and muscle loosening, hence the 0.8 score.\n\nThe description includes 'loosen up your muscles,' indicating gentle movement, aligning it also with 'The Comfort Moves' vibe. The music playlist featuring pop and global hits highlights a calm, easy-going energy suitable for a cool down, supporting a 0.6 score for this vibe.\n\nThe short duration and lack of aggressive intensity also confirm the absence of vibes associated with high energy or competitive workouts."
