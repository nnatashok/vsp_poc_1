  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as being on the mat, which implies that a mat is essential for performing the exercises, especially since the category is 'On The Mat'. The presence of mats used by the instructors in the image further supports this, resulting in a very high confidence score of 1.0.\n\nAdditionally, the image shows yoga blocks on each mat. Yoga blocks suggest support for posture exercises, aligning with the mobility focus on neck, shoulders, and upper back. Given their visibility and apparent use in the workout, the confidence score for blocks is very high at 0.9.\n\nNo other equipment is indicated by the metadata or image, suggesting that these exercises are primarily bodyweight-focused with optional block support."
