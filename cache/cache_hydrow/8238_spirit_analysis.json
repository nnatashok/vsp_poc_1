  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Technique Cool-Down' is classified primarily as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a high score of 0.9. This is strongly indicated by the rowing setting on a river, as evident from the image provided, which fits well with the nature-based exploration aspect of this spirit. Additionally, a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is applicable, scoring 0.8, due to the workout's focus on cooling down and the technique emphasis, which suggests a gentle and recovery-oriented approach. This is supported by the workout type and description, specifically mentioning 'cooling down.' The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also relevant, with a modest score of 0.6, because of the technique-focused description which implies precision, even during a cool-down. The titles and description do not suggest high intensity or fast-paced activity, thus excluding 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility.' Limited rhythmic elements exclude 'Flow & Rhythm.'"
