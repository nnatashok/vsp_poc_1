  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a high confidence score of 0.8. This is indicated by the use of terms such as 'climb in rhythm' and the maximum rhythm specified at 26, suggesting a focus on maintaining a consistent pace and movement coordination. The mention of 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' radio stations implies music-driven pacing, further reinforcing the rhythmic flow aspect. The secondary spirit is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a moderate score of 0.6. This is supported by the description's focus on a gentle challenge and the low intensity level (1 out of 3), which suggests a more relaxed and recovery-friendly session. The mention of 'breathe' as both a workout type and category emphasizes a calming and restorative focus. Higher intensity spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and sports specificity are excluded due to the gentle and beginner-friendly nature of the workout."
