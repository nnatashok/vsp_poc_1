  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout 'Upper Body Strength with Bands' specifically mentions \"resistance and mini bands\" as recommended equipment in the description, indicating a very high confidence (0.9) that resistance bands are necessary for this session. Additionally, given the category 'On The Mat' and visible mat in the image, a mat is likely needed for floor-based exercises, assigned a high confidence level of 0.7. The confidence level for the mat is not as high as for the resistance bands because it isn't explicitly mentioned in the description, but it is implied as part of the standard setup."
