  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title and description indicate that the session is held on the Charles River, strongly suggesting an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the natural setting and rowing on real water. The inclusion of 'race effort' and 'Power' as the format, along with the maximum rhythm and intensity level set to 3 out of 3, suggests a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as it highlights maximum effort and vigorous activity. Additionally, the mention of the 'M' Pattern race profile and Mike's structured and disciplined approach as drawn from his elite competitive rowing background, support assigning the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The playlist featuring Dance high and Global Hits aligns with high energy, reinforcing intense effort. The confidence in these classifications is high due to the specificity of the descriptions and setting."
