  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the category 'row,' which strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine. The name of the workout, 'Reduced Slide Cool-Down,' further implies a connection to rowing, as 'slide' typically refers to the seat mechanism on a rowing machine. The description includes terms like 'cool down' and 'technique,' which are often associated with rowing workouts. Given these factors, the confidence score for requiring a rowing machine is very high (1.0). Other equipment is not mentioned or implied in the metadata."
