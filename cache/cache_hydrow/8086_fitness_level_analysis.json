  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which means the exercise movements are primarily rowing-based. As per the Hydrow-specific rule, \ufffdrowing workouts are either Beginner or Intermediate in technique difficulty. The consistent split and rhythm provided (max of 26) suggest a focus on maintaining a steady technique but it's not particularly complex. The presence of an experienced instructor might elevate slight complexity, but overall, it's straightforward enough for a Beginner. Hence, the scores reflect a strong alignment with Beginner (0.9) and a weak alignment with Intermediate (0.2).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts 21 minutes and is aimed at maintaining a consistent split in rowing, marked with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, which indicates it's designed to be less physically demanding. The use of music suggests a gentle pacing. The duration and interval format may introduce mild challenges, but the overall low intensity rating suggests light primary activity with some elements of moderate exertion. Thus, Light has a score of 0.7 and Moderate a score of 0.3.",
