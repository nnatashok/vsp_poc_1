  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Power Pyramid Row' is strongly characterized by a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The description highlights 'fun and fast-paced,' 'HIIT,' and 'intensity level: 3 out of 3,' all of which are clear indicators of a high-energy session, scoring 0.9. The presence of 'intervals for 45, 30, and 15 seconds' further aligns with intense and dynamic exertion.\\n\\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also a relevant spirit, scoring 0.6, as the mention of a max rhythm of 36 and the playlist featuring rhythmic dance tracks like 'Bird Set Free' and 'Alors on danse' suggest a connection to music and coordination.\\n\\nThe image depicts an outdoor rowing setting, which pairs the workout with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, scoring 0.8. This environment enhances the adventurous aspect of rowing on a river.\\n\\nThe lack of methodical or recovery-focused elements resulted in excluding 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits."
