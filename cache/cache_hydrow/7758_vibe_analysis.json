  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Endurance Intervals Row,\" which suggests a focus on sustained effort, consistent rhythm, and mental focus, aligning well with \"The Meditative Grind\" vibe (score: 0.8). The format of 2-minute climbing intervals suggests a moderate intensity with repetition, indicating a rhythmic and endurance-focused experience.\n\nThe playlist, featuring rock and global hits, alongside songs like \"Rock And Roll All Nite,\" adds an energetic and uplifting element to the workout. This aligns it with \"The Endorphin Wave,\" which captures the feel-good, sustained energy aspect of the session (score: 0.7).\n\nThe mix of beat-driven tracks and the maximum rhythm mentioned in the metadata fits \"The Rhythmic Powerhouse\" vibe (score: 0.5). The music helps create a strong but fluid experience that supports the rowing activity.\n\nThe absence of extremely high intensity and explosive terms excludes more intense vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Firestarter.\" The confidence level is high due to clear indicators in the metadata."
