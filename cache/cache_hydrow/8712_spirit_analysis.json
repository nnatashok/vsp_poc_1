  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is assigned a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit (score: 0.75) based on the description of the instructor Dani's style, which includes 'feel-good, high-energy workouts'. The use of 'sweat' in workout type and category further suggests an intense session, as does the rowing intervals format, which often involves high-intensity bursts. \n\nA 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (score: 0.65) is evident from the specified 'intervals' format, max rhythm setting of 30, and technical details provided by Dani, a multiple-time World Champion and Paralympian, indicating a structured and technically precise workout. \n\nAn 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.5) is considered due to the mention of rowing 'along the shores of Newport Beach', which suggests an outdoor element. However, since the exact environment context isn't entirely clear (e.g., whether the workout was recorded in an outdoor setting), the score is moderate. The music genre and intermediate fitness level were less influential in determining other spirits, and no focus on recovery or sport-specifics was found, excluding those spirits."
