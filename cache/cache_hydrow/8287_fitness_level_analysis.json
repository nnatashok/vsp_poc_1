  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.95,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is short (5:54) with the 'cool down' type focusing on technique rather than intensity or duration, leading to a classification of Light effort difficulty. The Cool Down category typically involves lower energy expenditure aligning with this effort level. The presence of a moderate max rhythm (22) suggests controlled and less intense pacing, reinforcing this classification. Thus, the effort difficulty is strongly aligned with Light, as both duration and purpose indicate minimal physical demand.",
