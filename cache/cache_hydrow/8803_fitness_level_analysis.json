  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing-based session which typically falls into the Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty due to its fundamental repetitive motion. The description emphasizes 'building endurance and strong technique', indicating some focus on improving form, which suggests a slightly higher skill requirement. However, since the session utilizes 'intervals', it demands basic timing and rhythm. The 'breathe' workout type indicates a focus on breathing and endurance building, suited for beginners to intermediates. Given these factors and the clearly Beginner user fitness level requirement, Beginner difficulty is highly aligned, with moderate support for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is over 30 minutes, which slightly raises the effort level. The 'intervals' format suggests periodic rest intervals, allowing recovery but maintaining some effort. The intensity level is noted as 1 out of 3, indicating it is suitable for beginners but not without some challenge, thus fitting Light to Moderate effort difficulty. The focus seems to be on endurance ('building endurance'), underscoring its accessibility to those with lower fitness but some fitness effort is needed. This aligns with beginner users but slightly challenges them, hence rated between Light and Moderate.",
