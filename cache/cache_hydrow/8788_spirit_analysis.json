  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'Soothing & Restorative' due to explicit language in the metadata indicating a restorative and breath-focused session. The title 'Breath Focused Restore' and the description emphasize relaxation and guidance by breath, which fits perfectly with restorative practices. The music genre, featuring 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo,' supports a calm and soothing environment. The selection of songs like 'Back In My Body' by Maggie Rogers and 'Young Blood (Acoustic)' by Noah Kahan further emphasizes a calming and reflective atmosphere, aligning well with a restorative spirit. The classification under 'On The Mat' and the lack of equipment suggest a gentle practice focused on internal awareness rather than physical exertion. Thus, the classification as 'Soothing & Restorative' is made with high confidence and a strong score."
