  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is labeled as 'row,' which suggests a basic to moderate level of technique due to the fundamental nature of rowing mechanics. The inclusion of 'Drive' in the workout type does imply an 'Advanced' execution due to the focus on power, but technique complexity remains within Beginner to Intermediate range based on rowing-specific guidelines.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is primarily derived from the 'Drive' and 'Power' categories, plus the workout is described as an intense effort with increasing rhythm and effort every 15-seconds. The short duration (1:44) is offset by high-intensity bursts, making it challenging overall; hence a moderate to challenging effort level is appropriate.",
