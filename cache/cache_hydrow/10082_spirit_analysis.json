  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title 'Holding Your Power Row' and description 'Work on sustaining your power as your rhythm shifts with Dani along the Charles River' suggest a focus on intense, power-based rowing, supported by Dani Hansen's reputation for delivering 'high-energy' workouts. This aligns well with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as the workout involves rhythm changes and intervals that likely increase the heart rate and intensity (score 0.7). The mention of the 'Charles River' indicates an outdoor setting, classifying it strongly under 'Outdoor & Adventure' (score 0.9), especially as the workout is on the river itself. Both the workout type and instructor profile emphasize 'high-energy' elements, but the setting and rowing component overpower this aspect, thus the heavier weighting towards 'Outdoor & Adventure'. Other spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' could be considered due to rhythm shifts, but the primary focus on power and outdoor context makes this less relevant, hence not chosen."
