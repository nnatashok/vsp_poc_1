  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which highly suggests the use of rowing equipment. The title 'Performance vs Results Row' and the description in conjunction with the rowing focus imply that a rowing machine is essential for this workout. The image provided further confirms this by showing a person on a rowboat, although typically for indoor workouts a rowing machine would be used for similar exercises. Therefore, the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high."
