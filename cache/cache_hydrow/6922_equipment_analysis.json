  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and described as 'Rack up those meters,' which strongly indicates that a rowing machine is central to this exercise. Additionally, the metadata mentions 'maintaining high rhythms,' aligning with the use of an indoor rowing machine to track meters and rhythm, suggesting a very high confidence (1.0) in the requirement of a rowing machine. The image features a sculling scene, reinforcing the rowing context, but for practical implementation, an indoor rowing machine is implied."
