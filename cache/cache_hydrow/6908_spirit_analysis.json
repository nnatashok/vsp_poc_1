  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by its focus on flexibility and stretches, aiming to promote relaxation and recovery, evident in the description 'everyday stretches for your back.' This aligns strongly with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, which scores 0.9 due to the explicit emphasis on gentle movement and flexibility.\n\nAdditionally, the setting depicted in the image shows the exercises being conducted outdoors by the water, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The natural setting contributes to a calming, explorative vibe, supporting a secondary score of 0.7 for this spirit.\n\nThe absence of intense or structured language, along with the choice of music from the Indie Alternative and Global Hits genres, reinforces the focus on a calming and restorative experience rather than high-energy or structured training. Therefore, 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits are excluded."
