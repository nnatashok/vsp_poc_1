  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Reboot Workout' was chosen primarily due to the focus on 'intentional rest' and the cool-down nature specified in the title and description. This implies a low-stress, refreshing experience aimed at recovery, supported by the mellow music choices like 'Wonder' and 'Breathe.' The score of 0.9 reflects the strong alignment with recovery and rest aspects.\n\n'The Zen Flow' was also considered due to the breath-centered, intentional movement of rowing at a steady pace (max rhythm: 20). The absence of intense activity supports a grounding and unhurried vibe, with a score of 0.7 reflecting the meditative qualities of this workout. Other vibes were not considered, as the workout lacks intensity or competitive elements."
