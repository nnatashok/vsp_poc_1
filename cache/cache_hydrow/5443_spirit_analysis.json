  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Pop Intervals Row' is characterized by a pattern of increasing rhythm over four-minute intervals, which signifies a focus on rhythm and flow, supported by its designation as a 'breathe' type workout. The use of music genres like Pop with known upbeat and lyrical content further supports the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.8). The intensity level of 1 out of 3 suggests a moderately relaxed pace, aligning with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit (score: 0.6) due to its low intensity and the focus on rhythm rather than exertion. The image shows an outdoor rowing setting on a river, further reinforcing the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.7), as the workout leverages a natural terrain and environment for the session. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the lower intensity and the rhythmic rather than competitive format."
