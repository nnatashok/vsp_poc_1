  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the category 'row', and the description involves racing to accumulate meters, which strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. The presence of keywords such as \"Challenge Row\" and the context of \"Race off with James\" imply a rowing activity, confirming a very high confidence (1.0) in the requirement of a rowing machine for this workout. The image also supports this by showing a person on a rowing setup."
