  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Endurance Intervals Row,\" with category keywords including \"row\" and \"standard.\" This strongly indicates it is a rowing-focused workout. The mention of alternating strokes per minute (22, 26, and 28) is a common aspect of indoor rowing machine workouts. The presence of \"row\" in the category, as per guideline, necessitates the inclusion of a rowing machine with very high confidence. The image further supports this with the depiction of rowing activity, although it seems to be on water, emphasizing the rowing concept."
