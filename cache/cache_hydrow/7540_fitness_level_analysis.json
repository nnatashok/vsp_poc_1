  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which means the Technique Difficulty should either be Beginner or Intermediate. The description emphasizes practicing controlling splits at moderate rhythms (22 and 24), which suggests a focus on maintaining form rather than complex maneuvers. Given the 'breathe' workout type, it caters to sustaining effort rather than technical complexity. Thus, the Beginner level is strongly applicable with a slight possibility of Intermediate due to rhythm control.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as cardio-focused but with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, indicating low overall energy expenditure. The duration of 11 minutes and format labeled as 'steady' further suggests a lighter physical demand rather than high intensity. The presence of rhythm management could slightly increase the demand to Moderate for deconditioned users. Therefore, the primary classification is Light with some consideration for Moderate effort.",
