The metadata description mentions maintaining high rhythms and achieving a personal best, which aligns with typical rowing workout goals. Thus, a 'Rowing machine' is highly likely to be the required equipment, with a confidence score of 0.95 due to the strong association with rowing-focused content. The image also supports the idea of rowing being central to the workout. No other equipment is indicated in the metadata."
