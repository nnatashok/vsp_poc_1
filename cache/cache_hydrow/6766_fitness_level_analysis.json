  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and 'breathe', which typically signifies simple movements mainly focusing on breathing and rhythm. The metadata specifies a training intensity level of 1 out of 3, hinting at an accessible entry level. The description suggests aerobic intervals without any mention of complex maneuvers, suggesting very fundamental rowing techniques. Given the 'Beginner' user fitness level requirement and the inherent simplicity of rowing, technique complexity aligns strongly with the Beginner level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 16:23 minutes, and the intensity level is low (1 out of 3), which implies the effort level is on the lighter side. However, the focus on aerobic intervals indicates a possibility of low-to-medium energy expenditure, allowing for a moderate score. This balanced approach reflects adjustments for less fit individuals, accounting for the breathing intervals to maintain a maintainable energy outlay.",
