  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Steady Fundamentals Row' is characterized by a steady and rhythmic rowing session, focusing on different body parts in incremental segments, indicating a methodical and meditative quality. The max rhythm of 22 and the focus on 'breathe' and 'standard row' align well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, which involves repetition and zoning in, thus earning a high score of 0.8. The low intensity (1 out of 3), as well as the calming 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits' music choices that include artists like 'Death Cab For Cutie' and 'Olivia Rodrigo,' support a 'The Zen Flow' vibe, characterized by a grounding and intentional flow, hence it scores 0.7. Lastly, with a focus on breath and a low stress format, there are elements of 'The Reboot Workout,' particularly in the relaxation aspect, but it scores lower (0.4) due to the structured and focused nature of the workout, which aligns more with the other two vibes. Overall, the confidence in the classification is high due to explicit indicators of low intensity, steady rhythm, and focus on breath."
