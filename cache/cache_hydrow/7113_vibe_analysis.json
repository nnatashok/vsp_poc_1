  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'The Meditative Grind' due to its focus on endurance through steady rhythm rowing, as indicated by the 'steady state' and '22 rhythm'. This supports a meditative, repetitive zone-in experience common for this vibe, with a strong confidence score of 0.9. The workout's low intensity and 'breathe' categorization suggest a tranquil quality, aligning with 'The Zen Flow'. The use of softer music genres like Indie Alternative reinforces a calm ambiance, resulting in a moderate score of 0.7. The session's brief duration and lack of high intensity elements exclude more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout'. Overall confidence in these classifications is high at 0.85, given explicit evidence."
