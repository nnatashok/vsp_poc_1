  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled \"Power Row\" involves holding a fast sprint for two 4-minute intervals, indicating a focus on sustained effort over repetitive, intense periods. This aligns with \"The Meditative Grind\" vibe, where the rhythmic nature and endurance aspect are prominent. The usage of upbeat pop songs like \"Come On Eileen\" and \"What I Like About You\" contributes to an energetic atmosphere, supporting the \"Endorphin Wave\" vibe, with its feel-good, steady build during the intervals. \n\nAdditionally, the interval format and high-intensity level suggest a competitive element, aligning with \"The Competitor\" vibe, where challenge and intensity are key themes. There is high confidence in these classifications, as the metadata explicitly outlines the workout\u2019s intensity and structure, alongside music that suggests a motivating and uplifting energy."
