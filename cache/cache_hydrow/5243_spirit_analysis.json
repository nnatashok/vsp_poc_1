  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Flow & Rhythm' (0.75) due to the Pilates focus on smooth, controlled movements and the presence of rhythm-driven music (Dance mid, Global Hits). The description mentions 'quick, efficient,' implying continuous and coordinated movement. The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit (0.4) is also relevant as Pilates can focus on core control and gentle intensity, suitable for a calming effect. However, this is a secondary classification, as the session's rapid nature lessens the restorative aspect. \n\nThe image suggests an outdoor setting, bringing in elements of 'Outdoor & Adventure' (0.3), but with less confidence due to the lack of explicit mention of environmental engagement beyond setting. This adds a subtle nature-based quality to the session without fully defining it. The short length of the workout and its core-targeted nature exclude 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined,' which require longer or more complex routines. Overall confidence in the primary classification remains high due to clear indicators of movement and rhythm."
