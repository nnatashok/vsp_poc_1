  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Whole Body Circuit' featuring 60-second intervals on Hydrow, categorized under 'On The Mat' and using dumbbells. This setup aligns with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, with its beat-driven, strong yet fluid quality, especially given the presence of rhythm-focused Latin and Global Hits music. The playlist includes energetic and popular tracks like 'Con Calma' and 'Peligrosa,' which further enhance the music-infused nature of the workout. The 'Nightclub Workout' vibe is also relevant due to the upbeat and engaging Latin music, providing a vibrant, full-body euphoria often associated with nightclub environments. The energetic music and circuit format contribute to these vibes. The lack of a specified instructor adds a level of unpredictability, supporting these vibes. The high confidence level is due to clear metadata supporting these interpretations."
