  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Pilates', with its focus on strengthening the core, aligns well with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The outdoor setting by the dock conveys a peaceful and grounding atmosphere typical of slow-flow practices. The absence of intense equipment or hard-hitting intervals further supports this alignment. The use of pop and global hits music, with remix elements, introduces an expressive quality, connecting to 'The Groove Session' vibe. This integration of music makes the session more engaging and fun, as seen with remixed tracks from Seinabo Sey and Mabel, which may encourage participants to move fluidly. The short duration and location by a tall ship in Miami enhance the grounding and expressive nature. However, the lack of specific meditative guidance or intense dance elements reduces the score slightly, indicating moderate confidence in these classifications."
