  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is strongly classified under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to its focus on a restorative yoga practice, as indicated by the name 'Hero Pose Restorative Yoga' and description keywords like 'restore' and 'lift your heart up to open your chest and improve posture.' These elements emphasize relaxation and healing, supporting a very strong match with a score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the setting in an outdoor location with elements of nature, as seen in the image, aligns it with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The outdoor environment adds an exploratory and nature-focused element, which is reflected in a moderate score of 0.7.\n\nThe choice of music genres, such as 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo,' further supports the soothing nature of the session. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the absence of intensity or technical focus."
