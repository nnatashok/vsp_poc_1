This is also supported by the 'Dance mid, Global Hits' radio stations, suggesting a beat-driven atmosphere typically indicative of this vibe, earning it a score of 0.6.\n\nOther vibes were excluded due to the focus on strength and technique over endurance or agility, as well as the structured nature of a mat-based workout."
