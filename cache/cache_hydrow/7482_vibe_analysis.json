  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Technique Cool-Down' is categorized as a cool down with an emphasis on reinforcing technique, which aligns well with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe. The description emphasizes a gradual cool-down and strong body positions, suggesting a focus on low stress and a total-body refresh, justifying a score of 0.7 for this vibe. \n\nAdditionally, the 'Technique' focus and rowing activity indicate elements of 'The Meditative Grind,' where repetition and endurance play a role, earning this vibe a score of 0.6.\n\nThe music selection of calming tracks by The Fugees and Lighthouse Family, along with phrases like 'gradually cool down,' supports a 'Zen Flow' element. The session seems unhurried and intentional, getting a moderate score of 0.5 for this vibe.\n\nThe overall confidence is high based on the explicit cool down and technique reinforcement mention, but variability in music genre specifics lowers it slightly."
