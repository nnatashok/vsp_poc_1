This is supported by the optional use of yoga blocks, which are typically used for gentle stretching and alignment. The music playlist featuring artists like Billie Eilish and Maggie Rogers indicates calm, downtempo music, enhancing the restorative atmosphere with a score of 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, the image shows that the session is conducted outdoors near a dock with scenic surroundings, strongly supporting the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The setting in nature, combined with yoga on a mat, aligns closely with exploration and connection to the environment, earning a high score of 0.9 for this spirit. \n\nThe absence of high-intensity elements and the presence of calming music and environment exclude the other spirits, focusing it clearly on restorative practices and nature."
