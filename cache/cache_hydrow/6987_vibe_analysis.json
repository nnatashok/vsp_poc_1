  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Fitness Conditioning Row' exhibits strong characteristics of 'The Meditative Grind' due to its interval format and emphasis on repetition with 2-minute intervals at a consistent rhythm. The phrase 'build power' suggests a focus on endurance and steady improvement, aligning well with a meditative and repetitive style, hence a score of 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Competitor' vibe is reflected in the challenge of reaching 'max pace for 30\" blasters' which indicates a gamified and performance-driven aspect, worthy of a 0.7 score. The use of pop and global hits music adds an energizing and high-intensity element, which is often associated with competitive environments.\n\nThe description also supports 'The Endorphin Wave' with the mention of a 'run pace' and 'max pace', indicating a build-up in intensity, mirrored by the upbeat and popular music playlist, earning a score of 0.6. The 'drive, standard, row' categorization with high intensity suggests an engaging and invigorating workout that leads to a steady release of endorphins."
