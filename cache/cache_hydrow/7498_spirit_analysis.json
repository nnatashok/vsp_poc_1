  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout involves building an aerobic base with low rhythms and intervals, suggesting a focus on sustained, rhythmic movements, which aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score 0.65). The description's emphasis on 'breathe' and 'steady' further supports this classification.\n\nThe image of rowing on a river indicates an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, due to the natural setting (score 0.9). This outdoor environment is a strong factor in classifying workouts with an environmental engagement focus.\n\nThe workout's intensity level being 1 out of 3 and focus on breathing and steady rhythm aligns somewhat with 'Soothing & Restorative' (score 0.4), although the intensity and aerobic focus make it less prominent than the other spirits. The music selection, which includes artists known for energizing tracks, provides mixed signals, enhancing the rhythm aspect but not significantly influencing a high-energy classification."
