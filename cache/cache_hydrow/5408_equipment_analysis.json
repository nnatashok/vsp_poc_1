  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Philly Climb Row,\" which clearly indicates that it involves rowing. The metadata specifies the category as 'row,' and the description mentions climbing in rhythm, which aligns with the use of a rowing machine to vary intensities and simulate climbing. The image further supports this by displaying a person using a rowing setup. Therefore, the rowing machine is required for this workout with very high confidence."
