  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'International Women's Day Row' is classified with a primary spirit of 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.8 due to the HIIT format and maximum intensity level of 3 out of 3. The playlist features energetic pop songs like 'Confident' by Demi Lovato, which supports a high-paced environment. The use of the term 'drive' and the high rhythm also indicate an intense workout. Secondly, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is evident with a score of 0.7, as the image and context show the rowing taking place on water, making it an outdoor activity. This classification is supported by the visual elements of rowing on a river, aligning with the adventure and exploration themes. Other spirits were considered less relevant as the focus on intensity and outdoor setting was predominant."
