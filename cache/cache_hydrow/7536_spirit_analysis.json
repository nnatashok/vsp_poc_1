  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's title and description emphasize a meditative and calming focus, clearly indicating a \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit. The use of terms like 'Meditation' and 'Cool-Down' strongly suggest a session aimed at relaxation and stress reduction, scoring a 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nThe image shows a rowing activity in a natural outdoor environment, which aligns with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. The visibility of a serene river or lake setting supports this classification, though the emphasis remains more on meditation, scoring 0.7.\n\nThe calm music and the steadiness of the rhythm further enhance the restorative aspect, while the outdoor visual evidence bolsters the adventure component. Other spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Structured & Disciplined\" are excluded due to the lack of intensity or technical precision focus."
