  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is a cool-down session focused on 'strong and proper form,' indicating a technical and precision-focused approach, which aligns well with the 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe. This vibe is given a score of 0.65 due to the emphasis on technique and form.\n\nAdditionally, the use of the term 'cool-down' alongside soothing music genres ('Rock low,' 'Global Hits') suggests a calming and refreshing element, matching 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, earning a score of 0.7. This vibe is strongly supported by the video's purpose of winding down and resetting the body post-workout.\n\n'Zen Flow' is also a relevant vibe, scoring 0.6, as the session's relaxed pace (rhythm of 18) and intentional movements indicate a grounding and breath-centered experience.\n\nOverall, the absence of high intensity or competitive elements excludes vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.' The focus remains on calm, technique, and restoration, enhancing the confidence in selecting these vibes."
