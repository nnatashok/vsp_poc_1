  "vibesExplanation": "The workout '2022 Wrapped Row' aligns with 'The Competitor' and 'The Endorphin Wave' vibes. The format being a 'Climb' suggests a progressive intensity typical of competitive-style workouts, supporting 'The Competitor' vibe with a score of 0.7. Additionally, the maximum rhythm of 28 and the use of 'Drive' hint at an energetic pacing, resonating with the steady build and elevated energy associated with 'The Endorphin Wave', also scoring 0.7. The high-intensity level (3 out of 3) further emphasizes these highly engaged and energy-driven vibes. Although no specific music genre is mentioned, the inclusion of '00s Hits' and 'Global Hits' suggests an upbeat soundtrack similar to 'The Nightclub Workout', but due to the context of rowing and climb, this vibe scores lower at 0.3, contributing more of a lively atmosphere rather than a primary focus. The absence of an instructor and the advanced fitness level requirements reinforce a focused yet exhilarating workout experience. The vibe confidence is high at 0.75 due to strong indicators in format and intensity."
