  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.9 due to its nature as a 'cool down' session. The description mentions 'mindfulness' and scanning the body, both indicative of relaxation and recovery. The maximum rhythm of 20 supports this, suggesting a slow, calming pace. The inclusion of indie alternative music aids in creating a soothing atmosphere rather than an intense experience. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is assigned a score of 0.5 because although the format is 'steady,' there seems to be an element of continuous movement and mindfulness, hinting at rhythmic flow.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' gets a score of 0.6 based on the image showing the rowing session taking place outdoors on the water. This environment contributes to the adventure spirit, suggesting an exploration or connection with nature.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded as the metadata clearly positions this workout as a gentle, restorative session focused on winding down."
