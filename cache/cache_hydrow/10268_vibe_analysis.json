  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is identified as a 'cool down' focused on stroke refinement and technique, indicative of a calming and focused experience. The use of 'pick drills' and repeated muscle engagement aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, indicated by repetition and technique (score 0.8). Additionally, the chill and downtempo music genre suggests a calm, grounding atmosphere, which matches 'The Zen Flow' (score 0.6), emphasizing a grounding and breath-centered session. The short duration and cool-down nature steer away from high-intensity vibes."
