  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Rhythm 30 HIIT Row' and includes 1-minute intervals, which strongly suggests a high-intensity interval training format fitting 'The Firestarter' vibe. The intensity level noted as 3 out of 3 and the use of upbeat tracks like 'She's So Mean' and 'Dirty Little Secret' from artists like Matchbox Twenty imply a fast, electrifying session, hence a score of 0.85.\n\nThe workout's unpredictable and heart-racing elements of HIIT, particularly with the focus on exerting max pressure, also align with 'The Adrenaline Rush,' scoring 0.7. This is due to the full-body intensity and challenging intervals.\n\nLastly, the repetitive nature of rowing at a set rhythm fits within 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, as the workout includes consistent interval rowing, allowing for a rhythmic, focused state, therefore scoring 0.55.\n\nThe workout does not fit vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Reboot Workout' due to the high intensity and competitive nature of the format."
