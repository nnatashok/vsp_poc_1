  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Welcome to Ireland Mobility' was classified primarily as 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Soothing & Restorative.' The high score of 0.9 for 'Outdoor & Adventure' is due to the clear indication that the session is set outdoors in a picturesque location as per the image. The mention of 'hometown' and natural setting further supports this classification. Additionally, the on-the-mat format enhances the connection with nature.\n\nA secondary spirit of 'Soothing & Restorative' is conveyed by the emphasis on 'whole body mobility' and the overall gentle approach of a 15-minute mobility session. This indicates a focus on flexibility, stress relief, and recovery, which aligns with restorative practices.\n\nThe absence of rigorous activity or competition rules out 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility.' The music choices like 'The Corrs' and 'The Dubliners' complement a reflective and calming environment, enhancing the restorative aspect."
