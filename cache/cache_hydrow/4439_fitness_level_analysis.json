  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is based on rowing, which typically falls into the Beginner to Intermediate technique difficulty levels. The metadata indicates the workout focuses on rowing in sync, which requires some coordination, aligning it slightly with Intermediate skill. Additionally, the workout description emphasizes high-energy yet encouraging execution without overly complex movements, suitable for users beginning to develop more skill. Thus, it balances between Beginner and Intermediate levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, lasting 21 minutes with a climb format, involves continuous rowing at a max rhythm of 28, suggesting moderate intensity. The description tags it as 'sweat,' consistent with a Moderate to Challenging effort level. An intensity rating of 2 out of 3 supports a more challenging aspect for less fit users. However, it is still manageable due to the moderate duration and controlled rhythm, reflecting both Moderate and Challenging effort levels for beginners but primarily targeting intermediates.",
