  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata specifies the category as 'row', which typically involves using a rowing machine. Additionally, the description mentions a 'pause drill', a common rowing technique exercise, implying the use of rowing equipment. The inclusion of the word 'technique' also suggests a focus on rowing form, further reinforcing the need for a rowing machine. Although the image suggests an on-water scenario, the context likely translates to indoor rowing when applied to a virtual workout session."
