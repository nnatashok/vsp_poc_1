  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Charge the Iceberg Row' is characterized by intense energy and outdoor adventure. The description 'quick, high-intensity intervals' specifies a vigorous pace, justifying a high score for 'High-Energy & Intense' (0.9). The workout is labelled as HIIT with a maximum rhythm of 32, and it has an intensity level of 3 out of 3, reinforcing this classification.\n\nMoreover, the image and the setting 'towards the Aialik Glacier' clearly indicate an outdoor environment, strongly supporting the 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification (0.8). Interestingly, the music playlist consisting of energetic rock songs like 'Sweetness' by Jimmy Eat World aligns with a high-intensity vibe, further affirming the High-Energy spirit.\n\nThe clear outdoor setting and adventure-oriented title provide a strong basis for 'Outdoor & Adventure,' though it does not overshadow the emphasis on high intensity. Hence, 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are suitable classifications, with the former being dominant due to its emphasis in the description and format."
