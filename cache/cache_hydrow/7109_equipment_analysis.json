  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Sun Salutation Align,' and the category is 'On The Mat,' which strongly indicates the use of a yoga mat. The description mentions moving through 'sun salutations,' a traditional yoga flow generally performed on a mat. The image confirms this, showing the participants standing on mats in an outdoor setting. Therefore, the confidence level for the mat is very high at 1.0."
