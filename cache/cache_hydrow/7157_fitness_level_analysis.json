  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is a 'cool down', which implies low-intensity exercises with a focus on reducing heart rate after a session. The duration is relatively short at 10 minutes, designed to ease physical exertion. These factors strongly indicate a Light effort difficulty with a score of 0.9, as it involves minimal physical demand. The mere presence of rowing does hint at some energy expenditure, mildly supporting a Moderate classification at 0.1.",
