Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 10-minute 'cool down,' which inherently suggests low physical exertion, especially following a potentially intense rowing session. Cool downs are designed to lower heart rates and ease muscles into rest rather than continue exertion, making this very light in physical demand. The duration being relatively short further supports this assessment.",
