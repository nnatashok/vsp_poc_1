  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Club 26 Row' is classified with a strong emphasis on 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the visual evidence of rowing on a river. This aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, scoring 0.8. The high confidence level stems from the image, explicitly depicting a natural setting.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is also relevant, scoring 0.7. This is supported by the workout's description, mentioning 'elevate your heart rate' and '2-minute intervals,' indicative of an intense cardiovascular workout. The music playlist with pop and global hits implies an energetic atmosphere.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits were less applicable given the interval format and intensity focus. 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Sport & Agility' don't align with the workout's intensity and interval nature."
