  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Learn and Burn Row' workout is classified primarily as 'The Meditative Grind' due to its emphasis on steady rhythm rowing, described as 'steady row at rhythm 22', with an 'intensity level: 1 out of 3'. This suggests a relaxed and repetitive workout focusing on consistent movement over explosive intensity. The duration of 16 minutes and the low-intensity classification contribute to this assessment. The use of music such as 'One Of Us' and 'God Only Knows' aligns with a relaxed, introspective vibe, enhancing a meditative experience. The secondary vibe, 'The Groove Session', is considered due to the inclusion of pop and global hits, which could add a rhythmic and engaging element to the workout. However, the primary focus on a steady and controlled rowing pace keeps the main vibe aligned with 'The Meditative Grind'. The lack of intensity and specific learning component ('Learn about Scandinavian mythology') further solidifies the meditative nature of this workout."
