  "spiritsExplanation": "**Structured & Disciplined (Score: 0.7)**: The workout focuses on strengthening the upper body using resistance bands, indicating a structured approach to muscle building. The use of equipment (`long resistance band`) and categorization as a `strength` workout further supports a disciplined format. Despite the casual music genre, the aim of the session is methodical and purposeful.\n\n**Flow & Rhythm (Score: 0.6)**: The accompanying music, including pop hits, suggests a rhythmic component to the workout. This, combined with resistance band exercises, can lead to a continuous flow of movement, encouraging a mind-body connection and coordination.\n\n**Outdoor & Adventure (Score: 0.5)**: The image shows the workout being conducted on a wooden platform near water with a cityscape, adding an outdoor and exploratory element. Although it is categorized as `on-the-mat`, the setting contributes to the outdoor spirit, albeit with moderate confidence.\n\nOther potential spirits such as High-Energy & Intense or Soothing & Restorative are less applicable due to the strength focus and lack of emphasis on relaxation or high-intensity elements."
