  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata indicates a 'row' category, implying the use of a rowing machine. The image shows a person rowing, supporting this classification. The workout is a 'cool down' session, typically following a primary rowing activity, and the term 'Steady Cool-Down' further suggests a continuation on a rowing machine albeit at a reduced intensity. Therefore, the rowing machine is identified as essential with very high confidence (1.0). No other equipment is implied or necessary in the metadata or image provided."
