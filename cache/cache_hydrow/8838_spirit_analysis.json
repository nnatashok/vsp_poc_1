  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Whole Body Stretch Pilates' suggests a focus on stretching and reaching, which aligns well with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, earning it a high score of 0.9. This is supported by the descriptor 'whole body' and the typical gentle nature of Pilates sessions, emphasizing recovery and relaxation.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant, though to a slightly lesser degree, with a score of 0.7, due to the continuous movement characteristic of Pilates, especially when paired with music from 'Pop mid' and 'Global Hits' radio stations, which can encourage smooth, rhythmical exercises.\n\nThe image backdrop by the water and 'On The Mat' category fit the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, as it indicates an outdoor setting even though the workout itself remains mat-based. This earns a moderate score of 0.5 for contributing to an adventurous feel despite being less central to the workout's nature.\n\nOverall, the combination of soothing, rhythmical, and outdoor elements provides a confident classification of the workout's spirits."
