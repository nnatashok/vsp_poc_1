  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified into multiple spirits based on its varied components and metadata. \n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is strongly present due to the inclusion of a HIIT workout, as indicated by the transition to 'your Hydrow for a HIIT workout with Mike.' This aligns with the high intensity level of 3 out of 3, suggesting a vigorous segment designed to push limits, earning a score of 0.8.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is reflected in the transitioning nature of the workout from Pilates to HIIT to yoga. This smooth flow and integration of different exercises, alongside a playlist featuring rock and global hits, support a rhythm-driven experience, earning a score of 0.6.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is suggested by the imagery of outdoor settings and diverse elements within the workout, such as yoga possibly taking advantage of the natural surroundings. This earns a score of 0.6 due to the outdoor visuals depicted in the images associated with the workout.\n\nWhile each element suggests some structured approach, it's less methodical than typical 'Structured & Disciplined' workouts, hence not included as a dominant spirit. Similarly, it doesn\u2019t primarily focus on resting or sports-based agility, thus these spirits are not selected."
