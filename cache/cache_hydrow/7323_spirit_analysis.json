  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a high score of 0.9. The setting by the river, as shown in the image, strongly indicates an outdoor environment, which is a significant indicator for this spirit. Additionally, the playlist includes songs from energetic genres such as dance and global hits, supporting a secondary classification as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.7. The vigorous exercises targeting core and lower body, along with the motivating phrase 'Ready to feel the burn?', suggest an intense workout focused on pushing physical limits. \n\nLastly, 'Flow & Rhythm' is mildly represented with a score of 0.4. The presence of continuous music tracks may help maintain a rhythmic pace during the workout, though this spirit is less dominant due to the focus on strength and intensity.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded as the workout lacks methodical progression cues or any emphasis on recovery and relaxation."
