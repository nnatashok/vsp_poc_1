  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' primarily due to the HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) format, which involves '60, 45, and 30-second intervals' and a high intensity level of 3 out of 3, indicating a challenging and vigorous session. The playlist features upbeat and energetic music selections such as 'Acid Rain' and 'Million Voices', further supporting this spirit classification. The use of 'Drive' in both the category and workout type also emphasizes a powerful and dynamic workout.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant given the workout's setting on 'Indian Creek' in Miami Beach, where the session takes place outdoors in a natural environment. The image confirms the use of water-based rowing, which matches outdoor exploration and environmental engagement. This setting enhances the adventurous aspect of the workout. \n\nOther spirit options were considered, but the absence of specific mentions of rhythm or recovery focus, combined with the outdoor location and interval training, led to the exclusion of options like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Flow & Rhythm.'"
