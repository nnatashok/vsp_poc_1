  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout 'Welcome to Ireland Mobility' is described as a 'whole body mobility' session and is categorized under 'On The Mat'. This strongly implies the use of a mat, as mobility exercises often involve stretching and movement that requires a comfortable surface. The confidence is further heightened by the image showing an individual standing on a mat in an outdoor setting. Therefore, the confidence score for needing a mat is very high at 0.9."
