  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row' which limits the technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The description mentions 'intervals at your jog and run pace,' suggesting a slight increase in complexity. However, the focus on the 'breathe' workout type and the user fitness requirement being 'Beginner' indicate that movements are likely to be straightforward and accessible for beginners. The possible need for pacing can hint at a minor level of coordination, thus allowing a marginal recognition of intermediate complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "While the workout has a one out of three intensity level, suggesting it's not too demanding, the duration of 21 minutes and 'intervals at your jog and run pace' imply a moderate level of exertion. The interval format can make it somewhat challenging for less conditioned users, due to variations in pace. With a maximum rhythm of 26, the workout can push beyond a simple light effort, aligning more closely with moderate efforts and a slight nod towards challenging, especially considering the instructed pace shifts.",
