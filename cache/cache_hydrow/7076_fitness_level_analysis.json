  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically involves straightforward rowing movements. Given the 'breathe' category and a focus on rhythm every five minutes, this indicates a slightly more structured approach, possibly increasing complexity slightly beyond pure beginner level. Nonetheless, the row category ensures that the technique remains largely accessible, aligning most closely with Beginner and somewhat with Intermediate level.",
