  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled \"Unleashed Row,\" emphasizes a high-intensity approach, as indicated by the phrase \"Push your limits\" and \"max pace.\" This aligns with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, especially with an intensity level of 3 out of 3 and a structure of intervals, which suggests a challenging and vigorous session. The musical selection consisting of high-energy tracks by Fall Out Boy further supports this classification. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong emphasis on intensity throughout the workout.\n\nAdditionally, the image indicates rowing on a river, a natural outdoor setting, which fits the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This is reinforced by the environmental context visible in the background. The score of 0.8 reflects the strong outdoor aspect of the session.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' were not selected, as the workout's emphasis on maximum efforts and outdoor exploration takes precedence."
