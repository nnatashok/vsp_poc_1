  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Drive', which per Hydrow-specific rules implies an Advanced technique difficulty. The metadata highlights the requirement of managing 'maximum effort at varying rhythms', suggesting a need for good coordination and body awareness typical of Advanced-level technique. The involvement of a Paralympic-level instructor known for 'in-depth technical detail' also indicates a higher technique complexity. However, the technique is within the rowing category, aligning with the guidance not to exceed Advanced rating, staying clear of Expert.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The intensity level is rated 3 out of 3, which signifies one of the most physically demanding workouts categorized by the platform. The descriptor 'maintain maximum effort at varying rhythms' supports a Challenging to Extreme alignment in effort. The duration of 11:38 might initially suggest a lower effort level, but the indication of a high-intensity 'race piece' with 'climb' format intensifies the energy demand, likely surpassing Moderate and closely aligning with Challenging to Extreme effort levels.",
