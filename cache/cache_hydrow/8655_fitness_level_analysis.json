Such workouts are designed to help the body transition from exercise to a state of rest, indicating low energy expenditure and minimal physical demand. The maximum rhythm of 22 further suggests a gentle pace. Consequently, the effort difficulty is Light (score: 0.95), suitable for complete beginners or those seeking to cool down properly. There is an extremely low alignment with Moderate (score: 0.05) effort because some minimal exertion is required.",
