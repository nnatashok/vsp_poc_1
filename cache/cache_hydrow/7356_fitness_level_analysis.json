  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'drive' which is associated with an advanced technique level due to its intensity and demand for proper rowing form above the standard 'row' category. This suggests a need for good coordination and body awareness to execute properly, in alignment with the assigned user fitness level requirement of 'Advanced'. The inclusion of 2-minute HIIT intervals implies intermediate to advanced technique complexity, justifying the inclusion of Intermediate and Advanced levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features 2-minute intervals in a HIIT format, classified as intensity level 3 out of 3, suggesting a high energy expenditure and physical demand. This duration and format imply a significant exertion level, marking it as an extreme effort difficulty for most users, especially those in poor physical shape. The drive category further underscores the intensity of the workout, supporting the alignment with 'Extreme' effort difficulty.",
