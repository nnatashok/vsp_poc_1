  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves stretching, which typically results in low energy expenditure and falls within the 'Light' effort difficulty. The duration of 15:41 is suitable for a light workload, posing minimal physical challenge. The use of a foam roller could increase effort to some extent, bumping the session slightly towards 'Moderate', but the overall nature remains relaxing as indicated by the context of relieving tension.",
