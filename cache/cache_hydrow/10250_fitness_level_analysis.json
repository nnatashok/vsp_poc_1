  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This workout's technique difficulty is classified as Intermediate with a strong score of 0.9. Despite being labeled as 'Drive', which is typically associated with higher complexity, the Hydrow platform mandates that rowing workouts can only be categorized as 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate' in technique difficulty. The repetition of 'power strokes' suggests advanced instruction but does not surpass the Intermediate category per platform rules.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is primarily 'Challenging' with elements of 'Extreme', given the intensity level of 3 out of 3, as well as the description of pushing limits and maximizing power strokes. The interval format with a focus on high-intensity, high-rhythm strokes suggests substantial energy expenditure, making it strenuous and likely demanding for most users. This aligns it strongly with Challenging (0.75) and to a lesser degree with Extreme (0.25).",
