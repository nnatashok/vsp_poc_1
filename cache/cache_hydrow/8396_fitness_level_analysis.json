  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'row' and 'drive,' with pyramid intervals likely involving changes in tempo and coordination. While typically rowing emphasizes beginner-intermediate level movements, 'Drive' indicates a higher technique requirement. A score of 0.7 for Intermediate is due to the pyramid format requiring consistent form through tempo changes, aligning with an emphasis on rhythm and intensity increases, which surpass basic rowing skills but don't require advanced techniques.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The rowing workout features a 21-minute duration with 'Drive' and maximum intensity cues. The Pyramid format with high max rhythm demands significant energy, with a 3/3 intensity level indicating high physical demand. The rhythmic climb and descent signify sustained exertion, justifying a 'Challenging' score of 0.8. While not consistently 'Extreme,' the Intensity 3 of 3 and structured intervals can be extremely tough, hence a 0.6 extreme score.",
