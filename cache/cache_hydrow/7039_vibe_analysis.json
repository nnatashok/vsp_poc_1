  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by a focus on mobility and breath, indicated by the title 'Mobility + 10 Min Breathe Combo' and categorized under 'Breathe.' This emphasizes a calming, intentional movement, aligning with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, which is assigned a score of 0.7 due to the breath-centered, unhurried nature. The music selection, including songs by Goo Goo Dolls and Lifehouse, suggests a relaxed yet engaging atmosphere, further supporting this vibe. The workout's low intensity (1 out of 3) and inclusion of a 'Breathe' category also align well with 'The Reboot Workout,' assigned a 0.6 score. This fits the restorative, low-stress focus of the session, with its goal to 'open up and activate your body.' The subtle integration of rowing allows for mild cardiovascular activity, justifying a combination of both vibes."
