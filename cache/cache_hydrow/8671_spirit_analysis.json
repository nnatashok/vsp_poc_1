  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'March Race: Week 3 of 5' indicates a high level of intensity and energy. The format of 'Power' and an intensity level of 3 out of 3 suggest a vigorous and demanding session. The use of motivational keywords like 'race' and 'accumulate maximum meters' emphasizes the competitive and high-energy nature. The music playlist, featuring energetic bands like The Offspring and Jimmy Eat World, supports a fast-paced environment. Additionally, the visual context shows a rowing workout on water, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, leveraging natural settings. The race and power elements further solidify the 'High-Energy & Intense' categorization. The structured format and water-based setting confidently classify the workout primarily within these spirits."
