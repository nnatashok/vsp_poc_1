  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Power Row' features interval training on the Charles River with a high intensity level (3 out of 3), suggesting a strong physical and emotional engagement typical of 'The Meditative Grind'. The focus on rowing, along with the background of consistent rhythmical movement (max rhythm: 36+), aligns well with the zoning in and repetitive nature of this vibe, earning it a score of 0.7.\n\nThe presence of indie alternative and global hits, including bands like Flogging Molly and Dropkick Murphys, provide an energizing, uplifting atmosphere, characteristic of 'The Endorphin Wave'. This steady build-up of energy from the music supports a score of 0.6.\n\nThe interval format, combined with the description of building energy and power, implies bursts of high activity, which matches elements of 'The Adrenaline Rush'. This vibe is slightly less emphasized but still relevant, with a score of 0.5."
