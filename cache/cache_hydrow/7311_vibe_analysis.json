  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily focused on 'Proper Technique,' as highlighted in the title and description. This emphasis on technique and skill-building aligns strongly with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe, earning a score of 0.8 for its strong match as a technique-driven session. The use of indie alternative and global hits music suggests a relaxed atmosphere, appropriate for skill refinement.\n\nAdditionally, being categorized as a 'cool down' with a short duration of just under 6 minutes, it fits the 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which involves a low-stress, refreshing activity. The playlist includes 'Let Me Take You' and 'Heat Waves,' which are easygoing tracks, supporting a soothing and refreshing experience.\n\nThe absence of high-intensity indicators or competitive elements rules out other vibes, such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.' The dual focus on technique and cool-down elements justifies the selected vibes."
