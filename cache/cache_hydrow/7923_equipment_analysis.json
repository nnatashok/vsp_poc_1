  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine, and this is corroborated by the detailed metadata. The title 'Nord\u00e5svannet Bay Stern View' indicates a visual journey, suggesting that while engaging with this workout, visual experience is a focus, likely supported by a rowing simulation. Additionally, the category 'row' is explicitly mentioned, reinforcing the centrality of the rowing machine for this workout. Therefore, a very high confidence score of 0.95 is assigned to the rowing machine. There is no mention of any other equipment type, and the emphasis is on simulating a rowing experience rather than a mixture of exercises requiring different tools."
