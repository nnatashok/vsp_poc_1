  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Confident Training Row\" displays elements of **Flow & Rhythm** due to the consistent rhythm of strokes at rates 22 and 24, as mentioned in the description. The music playlist, featuring artists like Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato, reinforces this with its pop-driven beat, supporting a rhythm-focused session (confidence: 0.7). The image indicates that the session is conducted outdoors on water, supporting the **Outdoor & Adventure** spirit (confidence: 0.7). The workout's intensity level is 1 out of 3, labeled as 'breathe,' suggesting a possible alignment with a **Soothing & Restorative** spirit as it appears to prioritize mindful, relaxed pacing over intensity (confidence: 0.5). The structured elements implied by phrases like \"training plans\" were considered but found less prominent than the flow and outdoor elements. Overall, explicit mentions and visuals strongly support the selected spirits."
