  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified with 'High-Energy & Intense' as a strong match due to the '1-minute challenge for maximum meters' description, high intensity level (3 out of 3), and focus on power, which implies a fast-paced and effortful session. The music selection from Hip Hop/R&B High further supports this energetic classification. \n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is also appropriate since the workout is conducted outdoors on the Chicago River, as seen in the image, aligning with the adventurous spirit of being in a natural environment. The imagery and setting contribute significantly to this spirit.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' are less applicable as the focus is on power rather than fluidity or musicality, and 'Structured & Disciplined' doesn't fit as the session focuses on a single challenge rather than a methodical progression."
