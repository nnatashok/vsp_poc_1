  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Steady Adventure Row,\" which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the category explicitly includes \"row,\" further confirming the necessity of rowing equipment. The description also mentions working on maintaining a consistent split, a term that is typically associated with rowing. Given the category and focus of the workout, the confidence that a rowing machine is needed is very high at 1.0. The image also visually supports this, showing rowing activity on the water, implying rowing equipment is central to the workout."
