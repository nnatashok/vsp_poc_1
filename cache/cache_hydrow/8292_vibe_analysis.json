  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified predominantly under 'The Meditative Grind' due to its rowing format with repetitive 1-minute intervals, suggesting a focus on endurance. The 11-minute, high-intensity format aligns with the repetitive and focused nature typical of this vibe. \\n\\n'The Adrenaline Rush' is also relevant because the workout includes high-intensity intervals (HIIT) and uses words like 'navigate the swells,' indicating a challenging and unpredictable element in rowing through English Bay. \\n\\n'The Endorphin Wave' is considered due to the workout's rhythm and playlist featuring energetic indie and global hits, which likely contribute to a feel-good, steady energy build throughout the session. \\n\\nThe combination of high intensity, music, and interval structure supports these vibe selections, with no additional data pointing strongly towards other options."
