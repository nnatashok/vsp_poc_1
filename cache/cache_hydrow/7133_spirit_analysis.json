  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Heat Building Yoga Align,' emphasizes a sequence-based, breath-synchronized practice ('Move with your breath through sun salutation'), which aligns well with the Flow & Rhythm spirit, earning a high score of 0.8. The use of sun salutations, often associated with smooth transitions and a continuous flow, supports this classification.\n\nThe image shows the workout taking place outdoors in Seville, Spain, adding an Outdoor & Adventure element. The open natural setting captured in the imagery aligns with environmental exploration, meriting a score of 0.7.\n\nThe Chill low and Cool/Downtempo music genres complement these spirits by providing a relaxed, rhythmic backdrop ideal for a yoga session.\n\nNo indicators of high intensity or structured discipline were present, ruling out other spirits. The confidence level is high due to explicit environmental and activity description cues."
