  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout 'Learn and Burn Row' is categorized under 'breathe', 'standard', and 'row', indicating a focus on rowing activities. The description mentions rowing at a steady rhythm, specifically at rhythm 22, which strongly suggests the need for a rowing machine for the indoor version of the workout. Although the image shows outdoor rowing, the category 'row' and type 'breathe' imply an indoor setup, due to the usual context of guided rowing workouts. Thus, a rowing machine is identified with high confidence based on these details."
