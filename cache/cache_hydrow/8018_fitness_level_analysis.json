  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', which typically limits the Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. However, since this is a 'Drive' workout, which by Hydrow-specific rules suggests Advanced technique, we align this with Intermediate due to the imposed constraints. The intervals and rhythm data indicate a focus on coordination and control but are not complex enough to denote an Advanced level for rowing specifically.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 11:20 minutes with 1-minute intervals suggests a high-intensity session, especially with the 'Drive' categorization and a max rhythm of 30. The intensity level 3 out of 3 further confirms that the workout is very demanding. Because of the interval structure and high-intensity cues, the effort is classified between Challenging and Extreme; however, given the platform's audience, we provide stronger alignment with Challenging.",
