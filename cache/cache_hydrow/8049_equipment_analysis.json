  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title, 'Prince William Sound Bow View,' and the description, 'Explore the waters in Alaska as you row on your Hydrow,' both explicitly mention rowing and rowing on a Hydrow, a specific brand of rowing machine. Additionally, the metadata category includes 'row,' further confirming that a rowing machine is central to performing this workout. Therefore, I am very confident (1.0) that a rowing machine is required for this workout, and no other equipment is suggested or implied by the metadata."
