  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's 31-minute duration paired with 'high-intensity intervals' supports a high Effort Difficulty rating. The intensity level noted as '3 out of 3' indicates a physically demanding session, likely to include bursts of maximal effort and minimal rest, characteristic of an Extreme level. The music geared towards upbeat, driving Pop and Global Hits further suggests a continued effort level, but, given the standard row category, I assign scores for both Challenging and Extreme.",
