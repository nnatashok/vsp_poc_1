  "vibesExplanation": "The title 'Chest Opening Restore' and description 'Open your chest and side body as Owen leads you through this restorative practice' strongly suggest a vibe centered on gentle stretching and relaxation. The inclusion of 'restore' in the workout type and 'On The Mat' category confirm a focus on a restorative and calming session. The music genres 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' further emphasize a calming and soothing atmosphere, fitting 'The Reboot Workout' vibe which focuses on deep stretch and total-body refresh, earning a score of 0.85. 'The Zen Flow' vibe is also relevant, as the practice seems grounding and intentional, deserving a score of 0.8. The lack of high intensity or competitive elements eliminates more vigorous vibes."
