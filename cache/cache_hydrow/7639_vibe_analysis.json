  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is best classified under 'The Zen Flow' due to the calming, breath-centered, and unhurried nature of a beginner yoga flow, with the added scenic backdrop of Achill Island which enhances the grounding experience. The chill and downtempo music playlist, featuring artists like RY X and Billie Eilish's 'Ocean Eyes,' supports a peaceful and intentional atmosphere (score: 0.9).\n\nAdditionally, 'The Meditative Grind' is applicable given the repetitive nature of a beginner yoga flow, focusing on consistency and controlled movements. This aligns with the flow's tranquil yet engaging style (score: 0.7).\n\nFurthermore, 'The Nature Flow' vibe is strongly present due to the outdoor setting overlooking a scenic island. This adds an element of full-body rhythm intertwined with nature, making the movement more immersive and connected to the environment (score: 0.8). The intentional location choice and music that enhances the natural setting distinctly support this classification."
