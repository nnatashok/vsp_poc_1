  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is focused on building upper body strength with a resistance band, which aligns with \"The Masterclass Workout\" vibe due to the emphasis on technique and skill-building related to posture and corrective movements. The selection of indie and global hits suggests a calm yet focused music environment, supporting this classification with a score of 0.7 due to clear indicators of technique focus. \n\nThe workout also fits \"The Foundation Builder\" vibe, as it aims to support proper posture through corrective movements, suggesting a foundational and corrective exercise approach. The emphasis on building strength using accessible equipment like a resistance band further suggests this vibe, earning a score of 0.7 for its alignment with rebuilding and perfecting technique.\n\n\"The Meditative Grind\" vibe seems relevant due to the repetitive nature of strength training and the potential for a focused, absorbed session on the mat. However, the session duration and music choice slightly conflict with a fully meditative state, leading to a moderate score of 0.5. The absence of high intensity or explosive movements excludes higher intensity vibes like \"The Warrior Workout.\""
