  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's metadata indicates a high relevance to rowing, as evidenced by the category tags 'row' and 'drive'. The description mentions racing off a high rhythm, which is consistent with rowing techniques that prioritize rhythm and power for maximizing meters covered. The presence of the 'row' category mandates the inclusion of a 'Rowing machine' with very high confidence. The workout's focus on power and high rhythms further supports the necessity of a rowing machine, as this equipment is central to achieving the desired outcomes in such a workout format."
