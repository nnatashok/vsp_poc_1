  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to the emphasis on high intensities, as indicated by terms like 'high intensities,' 'HIIT,' and the 'drive' category. The format involves short, intense intervals of 30, 45, and 60 seconds, which is characteristic of intense and high-energy workouts. The playlist featuring dance and global hits music further supports the energetic nature, aiming to elevate heart rate and motivation. A score of 0.9 indicates the very strong match.\n\nThe presence of a rowing session on a river, as shown in the image, suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The natural outdoor setting adds an exploratory and adventurous element. Thus, a score of 0.7 is assigned to 'Outdoor & Adventure,' reflecting significant presence but not the primary focus.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded due to the lack of emphasis on continuous, smooth movement, relaxation, or recovery."
