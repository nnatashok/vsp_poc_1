  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's nature as a 'cool down' strongly suggests a Soothing & Restorative spirit, aimed at aiding recovery and relaxation. The low rhythm strokes and focus on activating glutes and hamstrings indicate a gentle, technique-focused session rather than an intense one, justifying a high confidence score of 0.9 for Soothing & Restorative.\n\nThe use of low rhythm strokes and the presence of music genres like 'Pop low' and 'Global Hits' suggest an element of Flow & Rhythm, even though the workout's primary focus is technical cool down. This gives it a moderate score of 0.6 as the rhythmic component is somewhat present, though not dominant.\n\nThe image shows an outdoor setting on a river, which aligns with the Outdoor & Adventure spirit, though this is not explicitly stated in the metadata. This setting contributes to a supportive environment for relaxation, earning it a moderate confidence score of 0.5 for being part of the experience, though not the main focus."
