  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Power HIIT Row' strongly embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The description emphasizes high-intensity intervals with 90\" and 60\" durations followed by 15\" sprints, highlighting the focus on maximum effort. The intensity level rated 3 out of 3 further reinforces this classification. The use of Dance high and Global Hits radio stations, along with high-energy songs like 'Higher Love' and 'Don't Stop Movin'', supports this intense atmosphere, leading to a high score of 0.95.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant due to the rowing setting on a river, as seen in the image. This natural environment contributes significantly to this spirit, resulting in a score of 0.75.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is mildly present. The playlist features rhythmic, upbeat music that can create a sense of flow, but the primary focus is on intensity, making this a secondary element with a score of 0.4."
