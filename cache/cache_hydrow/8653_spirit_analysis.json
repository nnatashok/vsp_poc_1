  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Steady Cool-Down' explicitly indicates a calming, low-intensity nature, which aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The use of phrases like 'cool down' and 'steadily' suggest a focus on recovery and relaxation after a rigorous workout, with a low rhythm further supporting this classification. The soothing music genre tags such as 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' reinforce this spirit, justifying a high score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the image shows the workout taking place on a river, which fits the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the natural outdoor setting. Although the primary focus is soothing recovery, the outdoor environment grants this secondary classification, with a moderate score of 0.75. The main emphasis remains on recovery and relaxation, hence, the strong alignment with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit."
