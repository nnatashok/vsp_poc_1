  "spiritsExplanation": "The \"Stroke Upgrade Warm-Up\" workout mainly embodies the \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit. The description highlights refining technique and connecting each part of the stroke, indicating a methodical approach focused on precision and progression. The mention of \"Technique\" as a format further supports this classification. A strong score of 0.9 reflects the clear emphasis on technical improvement and structured exercise.\n\nAdditionally, the workout is conducted on a rowing setup in a natural outdoor setting, as evident from the image, and titled with elements like a river. This suggests an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit, capturing the essence of nature and exploration. The workout's outdoor setting verifies a strong match for this spirit, granting it a score of 0.8.\n\nNeither \"High-Energy & Intense\" nor \"Flow & Rhythm\" is suitable due to the workout's focus on technique over high-energy movement or continuous rhythm. Similarly, \"Soothing & Restorative\" does not apply due to the emphasis on technique rather than relaxation or recovery."
