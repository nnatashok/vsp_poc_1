  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Samba Row' is primarily associated with 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe due to its musical elements and setting. The location on the shores of Rio de Janeiro paired with Latin and global hits radio stations suggests a festive and rhythmic atmosphere, akin to a dance or nightclub vibe. The title 'Samba' further underscores the cultural and musical exuberance typical in dance-focused workouts, aligning with this vibe. The lightly structured format of intervals contributes to a sense of dynamic energy, fitting well with this classification, hence a score of 0.75.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Meditative Grind' is applicable given the workout's rowing nature. The duration of 21 minutes and focus on proper rowing form and results contribute to a steady rhythmic element typical of this vibe. Though the vibe of meditative grind isn't as prominent as the nightclub due to emphasis on intensity and fun, it significantly informs the workout experience, hence a score of 0.6. The advanced fitness level requirement and maximum rhythm intensity rating suggest a challenging and focused workout experience, warranting this assessment."
