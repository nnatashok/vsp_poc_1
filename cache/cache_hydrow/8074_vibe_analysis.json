  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Power Pyramid Row' suggests a focus on endurance and rhythmic progression, aligning with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to the format 'Pyramid' and climb in intensity, which naturally invites repetition over 31 minutes. The music playlist includes indie and alternative rock, which complements the structured intensity, contributing to sustained focus and endurance.\n\n'Explicit lyrics' and 'sweat' category further imply a challenging yet steady buildup in energy, with music choices like Jane's Addiction and The Offspring enhancing this gradually intensifying flow, aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe. The rhythm and progressive challenge of the songs create a strong and uplifting experience, typical of this vibe.\n\n'Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe is moderately indicated by the combination of indie alternative beats driving the workout, though the explicit lyrical nature lacks full alignment with a more fluid workout than what would typically embody this vibe."
