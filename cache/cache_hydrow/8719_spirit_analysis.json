  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit for this workout is 'Structured & Disciplined' due to the 'circuit' format and 'targeted upper body' focus, implying a specific and methodical approach to building strength and conditioning the upper body. The use of dumbbells and rowing machine adds to this organized, structured nature, supporting a score of 0.65.\n\nAnother notable spirit is 'Sport & Agility', as the workout involves an interval on the Hydrow and uses hip-hop music, suggesting a fast-paced and athletic element that requires coordination and performance, giving it a score of 0.55. \n\n'High-Energy & Intense' was considered but given a lower likelihood due to the moderate rhythm indicated by max rhythm: 24, and the short duration, which limits sustained high energy levels."
