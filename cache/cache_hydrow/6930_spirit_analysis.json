  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout involves Pilates, which typically focuses on controlled, flowing movements and a mind-body connection, aligning it with the Flow & Rhythm spirit. The use of popular music tracks by The Weeknd suggests a rhythmic element, reinforcing this classification. The guidance through back extension exercises with terms like 'lying face down' indicates a gentle, restorative approach, aligning with the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The description of being 'on the mat' and the outdoor setting in the image may suggest a tranquil environment, enhancing the restorative aspect. High-energy, sports, or adventure elements are absent, guiding the exclusion of those spirits."
