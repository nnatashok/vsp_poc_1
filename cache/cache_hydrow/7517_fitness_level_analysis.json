  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'row' with a 'sweat' type, implying a rowing-based exercise focus, which according to Hydrow-specific rules, typically falls into the Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty levels. Since rowing itself focuses more on rhythmic and repetitive motion rather than technical complexity, the technique difficulty leans more toward 'Beginner'. The use of 2.5-minute intervals suggests a format that does not involve complex choreography or advanced technique, supporting a strong Beginner classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes '2.5-minute intervals' and is classified as a 'sweat' workout with intensity level 2 out of 3. This indicates that while the session is intended to increase effort, the structure allows for periodic recovery. The 21-minute duration is typical of workouts that require a Moderate level of physical exertion, but the rowing and sprint intervals add a Challenging element for those less conditioned, balancing the effort difficulty across these two levels.",
