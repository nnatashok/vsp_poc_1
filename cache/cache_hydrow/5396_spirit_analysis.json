  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Team Endurance Row' with a max rhythm indicates a focus on maintaining a consistent pace, which aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The use of music from dance and global hits further supports this classification, as these genres often enhance rhythmic movement. The description mentions a 'team' approach and 'endurance,' suggesting a cooperative, sustained effort typical in flow exercises. The presence of a 'breathe' format suggests a moderate, steady pace rather than high intensity, aligning with this spirit rather than 'High-Energy & Intense'.\n\nFurthermore, the image depicts the workout taking place on a river, matching the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Outdoor settings, such as the natural environment in the picture, typically involve environmental challenges and exploration, supporting this classification.\n\nThe intensity level is 1 out of 3, further excluding 'High-Energy & Intense' and hinting at a more rhythm-focused or enjoyable outdoor rowing session."
