  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Reboot Workout' with a score of 0.8. This is based on the title and description which emphasize stretching, ideal for recovery and refreshing the body after a run. The stretching routine, both static and dynamic, fits the theme of a total-body refresh and low-stress movement. The background music including genres like Soul/Funk/Disco/Motown contributes to a relaxing and rejuvenating atmosphere.\n\n' The Deep Recharge' is also applicable with a score of 0.6, as the workout involves gentle stretching designed to reset and relax the body, aligning with the vibe's focus on nervous system reset through ultra-gentle movement.\n\nA mild score of 0.4 is assigned to 'The Groove Session' due to the playlist's beat-driven tracks like 'Doo Wop (That Thing)' by Lauryn Hill and 'Take My Breath' by The Weeknd, which can add a slightly fun and fluid element to the stretching session.\n\nOther potential vibes were excluded due to the non-intense, recovery-focused nature of the workout, which does not align with high-energy or strength-driven vibes."
