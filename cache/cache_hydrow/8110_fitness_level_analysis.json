  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which limits the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. The metadata description uses the term 'cruise down the Charles River' suggesting a straightforward rowing experience. Additionally, with a workout intensity of 1 out of 3 and a relational focus on 'breathe', the complexity appears minimal, aligning best with Beginner-level difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 21 minutes and an intensity level of 1 out of 3 suggest a workout that is easier on physical demands. The 'breathe' and 'cruise' terms in the description point to a lighter, steady-state rhythm rather than an intensely challenging session. Although it is a bit over the typical timeframe for purely light exertion, it's closer to that category, given the overall context and rhythm details.",
