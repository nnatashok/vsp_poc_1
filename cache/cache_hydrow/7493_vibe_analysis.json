  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified mainly as 'The Meditative Grind' due to its focus on an 'advanced, endurance row' and a 'format: Power', which indicates a repetitive, endurance-based activity. This is strongly supported by the 'max rhythm' of 28, aligning with a meditative, consistent effort vibe. The confidence in this vibe is high, at 0.9, due to the explicit mention of endurance.\n\n'Endorphin Wave' is chosen as a secondary vibe with a score of 0.8, supported by the high-intensity level (3 out of 3) and the uplifting, energetic dance music playlist ('Dance high, Global Hits'). The continuous effort and steady challenge aligns with a feel-good, energetic vibe often associated with endorphins.\n\nLastly, 'The Warrior Workout' is included with a score of 0.6. The description mentioning 'have the strength to identify your weaknesses and be prepared to fail to succeed' suggests a mental and physical toughness element, resonating with the warrior mentality of overcoming challenges. \n\nThe combination of endurance, rhythmic repetition, high energy music, and an intense push to overcome personal weaknesses supports this classification. Other vibes were not selected as they do not align with the workout\u2019s endurance and power focus."
