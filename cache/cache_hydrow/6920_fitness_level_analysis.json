  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout length is 11:03 minutes, and the 'align' type suggests more stationary poses focused on stretching and alignment rather than high energy output. The playlist features calm and downtempo music, supporting a relaxed, less strenuous session. Thus, it predominantly falls into the Light category, but some poses may moderately challenge flexibility and require minimal effort beyond resting conditions.",
