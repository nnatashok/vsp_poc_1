  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Bodyweight Strength' features a setting that overlooks the lush mountains of Norway, strongly indicating an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, deserving a high score of 0.9. This outdoor scenery coupled with the physical engagement on a mat aligns perfectly with exploratory and nature-linking elements, lending a sense of adventure to the workout.\n\nThe structured nature of the workout targets core engagement and stability, fitting the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, with a score of 0.6. The focus on bodyweight strength exercises typically involves a methodical and precise approach, consistent with structured routines.\n\nFinally, the playlist featuring energetic and rhythmic tracks like 'Stay (Petit Biscuit Remix)' implies a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit as well. The influence of music-driven pacing suggests this element with moderate confidence, though it's secondary to the primary spirits identified. This is reflected in the intermediate score of 0.5. The absence of specified music genre slightly lowers confidence in this classification, but the dance and global hits provide some basis for this spirit classification."
