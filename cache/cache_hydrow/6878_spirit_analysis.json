  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Yoga Flow\" aligns closely with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to its focus on gentle, continuous movement as suggested by the word \"Flow\" in both the title and description, and reinforced by the mention of \"chill mid\" and \"cool/downtempo\" music in the playlist. The smooth, flowing nature of yoga, combined with the music selections such as 'Sundream' by R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL, suggests a rhythmic, meditative experience. \n\nAdditionally, the outdoor location in Long Beach, evidenced by the description and accompanying image depicting a serene, natural environment with a lighthouse, aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Outdoor settings typically enhance the connection to nature and exploration. Thus, the workout is given a strong score for 'Outdoor & Adventure'. \n\nThe low-intensity nature and soothing backdrop make other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' less applicable to this session."
