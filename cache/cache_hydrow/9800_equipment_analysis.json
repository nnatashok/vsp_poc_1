  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title, '2022 Wrapped Row,' along with the category tags 'row' and 'Drive,standard,row,' strongly indicate that this is a rowing workout. In addition, the format being labeled as 'Climb' and 'Max rhythm: 28' suggests a performance-focused rowing session. Since the category type includes 'row,' the inclusion of a rowing machine is mandatory and central to the workout. Thus, the confidence level for the rowing machine is set at a very high 1.0, as this equipment is explicitly required for executing the workout effectively."
