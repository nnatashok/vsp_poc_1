  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Core Burn Express Pilates' embodies a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to its outdoor setting overlooking Boston, as seen in the image. The natural background and environment play a crucial part in delivering this adventurous quality, scored at 0.8. \\n\\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also prevalent, hinted by the music selection of Hip Hop/R&B and 'Global Hits,' which drives a rhythmic and engaging workout experience. Pilates typically emphasize smooth, continuous movements and a strong mind-body connection, fitting well within this spirit with a score of 0.7. \\n\\nThe use of energetic songs such as 'Super Freaky Girl' by Nicki Minaj further supports the Flow & Rhythm classification. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were less relevant due to the short duration and focus on core engagement rather than a structured or high-intensity format."
