  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Moving Better for Father's Day' is primarily focused on mobility exercises, which aligns well with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as indicated by phrases such as 'move through everyday mobility exercises' and 'dedicated to all the dads and role models'. This suggests a gentle, restorative approach. The playlist featuring soft rock songs from artists like the Eagles and Queen complements this relaxing theme. Therefore, a high score of 0.8 is given to this spirit.\n\nThe image shows an outdoor setting, which strongly suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The mention of being 'on the mat' in standard settings and the visible natural environment supports the idea of a workout connected with nature. Given the visual evidence and the outdoor focus, this spirit is given a score of 0.7.\n\nThe absence of any indicators of high intensity or athletic skills ruled out associated spirits. The classification places significant emphasis on the restorative and outdoor elements present."
