  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified with a primary spirit of Outdoor & Adventure (score: 0.9) as the image shows rowing on a river, which fits the natural outdoor setting. High-Energy & Intense (score: 0.8) is also assigned due to the metadata indicating a HIIT format with 'high intensity intervals' and a maximum rhythm of 32, supported by the use of tracks with energetic and upbeat music from artists like Kelly Clarkson and Olivia Rodrigo. Flow & Rhythm (score: 0.7) is added because the playlist includes music that likely supports a rhythm-driven session. The explicit lyrics and high-intensity level support these selections, but particularly highlight the energetic nature of the workout. The absence of detailed structured training elements or recovery focus excludes other spirits."
