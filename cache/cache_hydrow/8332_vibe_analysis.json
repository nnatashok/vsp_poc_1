  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Memory Lane Row' indicates a focus on rowing, which typically aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' due to the repetitive, rhythmic nature of rowing. Additionally, the workout format, 'Pyramid,' and the specified max rhythm of 28 suggest a structured yet steady approach, reinforcing a meditative vibe. The narrative description of exploring the 'sunny skies of Vancouver,' combined with outdoor rowing, gives the workout an exploratory feel, aligning with 'The Explorer's Workout.' The music playlist, including mid-intensity rock and global hits with songs like 'Life Is A Highway,' contributes to an uplifting, energy-building atmosphere, suggesting 'The Endorphin Wave.' Overall, the combination of steady pacing, scenic elements, and motivating music supports these vibe selections. The intensity level being 2 out of 3 indicates a moderate challenge, suitable for these vibes."
