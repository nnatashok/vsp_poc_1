  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Recovery Cool-Down', emphasizing a focus on cooling the body down and reinforcing technique, closely aligning with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe. The use of terms such as 'cooling down' and 'steady' format suggests a focus on recovery and refreshment, hence the high confidence score of 0.9 for The Reboot Workout vibe. Additionally, the playlist features soothing and rhythmic tracks like 'All The Lovers' and 'Latch', which enhances a recovery and feel-good atmosphere.\n\nThe 'Meditative Grind' vibe is also relevant due to the repetitive, steady nature of rowing paired with a cool-down session, supported by the 'steady' format and long duration of 10 minutes. The focus on reinforcing technique adds a mindful element, thus a moderate score of 0.7 is given. The lack of intense music or high-paced elements excludes more energetic vibes like The Warrior Workout or The Rhythm Powerhouse."
