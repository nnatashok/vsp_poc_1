  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Climbing Intervals Warm-Up' has a strong Flow & Rhythm spirit (score: 0.75) due to phrases like \"climb up in rhythm\" and the inclusion of music from dance and global hits, suggesting a smooth, music-driven pace. The emphasis on rhythm aligns well with mind-body connection elements typical of the Flow & Rhythm spirit. The score reflects clear indicators of rhythmic movement. \n\nAdditionally, there is an Outdoor & Adventure element (score: 0.65) based on the rowing activity, especially given the individual in the provided image is outdoors on a river. This matches the description provided in the guidelines about rowing sessions conducted in natural settings. The score reflects a supportive yet secondary spirit, as the main focus of the workout seems to be preparing the body through rhythmic climbing rather than exploring environmental challenges. Other spirits like High-Energy & Intense are not well-represented due to the warm-up format."
