The max rhythm of 32 strokes per minute aligns with short, explosive efforts, scoring 0.8 due to its perfect embodiment of quick, powerful intervals. The intense nature, labeled 'HIIT' and 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3,' supports 'The Warrior Workout' due to its primal energy and intensity-driven format, scoring 0.7. The Indie Alternative and Global Hits music selection adds an adrenalizing backdrop, reinforcing 'The Adrenaline Rush,' which captures full-body intensity and heart-racing qualities, scoring 0.6. Despite lacking a specific track categorization, the combination of music genre and workout intensity clearly supports these vibes. The absence of specified equipment and instructor suggests a minimalistic, focus-driven session, enhancing the raw energy classification."
