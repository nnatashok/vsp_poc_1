  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'May Race: Week 3 of 4' and features a workout type described as 'drive, standard, row,' with a coach who is an accomplished rower, Mike Dostal. These factors strongly suggest this is a rowing workout. The category is explicitly labeled as 'row,' indicating that a rowing machine is indispensable for this activity. The high intensity level (3 out of 3) further suggests the need for a rowing machine to execute the 'Drive' workout type, which focuses on rowing power and rhythm. Therefore, the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high at 1.0."
