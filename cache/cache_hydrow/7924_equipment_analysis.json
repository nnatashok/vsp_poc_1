  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's category is explicitly listed as 'row', which strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. In accordance with the analysis guidelines, the mention of 'row' in the category requires the inclusion of a Rowing machine with a very high confidence score. Additionally, the workout name \"Nord\u00e5svannet Bay Stern View\" and description \"Escape to the rolling hills of Norway on flat water\" suggest an immersive experience, typically associated with rowing workouts on platforms that simulate outdoor rowing environments. This further reinforces the necessity of a rowing machine. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata, focusing solely on the rowing experience."
