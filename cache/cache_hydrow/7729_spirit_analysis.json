  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Pause Drill Cool-Down' session is set along the Connecticut River, which strongly indicates an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to its natural outdoor environment, scoring 0.9. The emphasis on 'technique' and 'pause drills' aligns with a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, as it suggests methodical focus on precision and improvement, hence a score of 0.7. Additionally, the workout is categorized as a 'cool down' with a relatively low rhythm cap of 22 strokes per minute, fitting a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, thus scoring 0.6. The use of country and mellow music supports this soothing aspect. The spirits 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Flow & Rhythm' are excluded due to the lower pace and focus on technical drills over high intensity or seamless flow."
