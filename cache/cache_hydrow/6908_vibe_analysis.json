  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Essential Stretches for Your Back,' focuses on flexibility and everyday stretches, indicating a gentle and restorative approach, aligning well with 'The Reboot Workout.' The short duration (10 minutes 40 seconds) and lack of required equipment further support a vibe of simplicity and accessibility, typical of a session designed for total-body refresh.\n\nThe playlist features indie and global hits like 'Hit 'em Up Style (Oops!)' and 'The Way Love Goes,' which are mellow and relaxed, enhancing a calming atmosphere, thus aligning with 'The Deep Recharge.' The music isn't specified to be high-energy or intense, thereby further confirming the tranquil nature of the workout.\n\nFinally, the categorization under 'On The Mat' and the focus on ease of movement suggest a safe and comfortable environment, lending a slight match to 'The Comfort Moves.' The absence of intensity-related indicators also supports excluding vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.'"
