  "vibesExplanation": "The workout features high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format with a mix of short bursts (30, 45, and 60-second intervals), indicating a strong fit for 'The Firestarter' vibe. The energetic music playlist including 'Hit 'em Up Style' and 'Push The Button' aligns well with the 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe, creating an electrifying atmosphere. The combination of these elements supports a high confidence in these first two vibes (scores: 0.9 and 0.7 respectively). The repetitive rowing and endurance focus suggest elements of 'The Meditative Grind' as well, though with moderate confidence, given the intensity overrides pure meditation (score: 0.5). The intensity level of 3 out of 3 and the lively music playlist reinforce the primary fiery vibe."
