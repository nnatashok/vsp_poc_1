  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'The Reboot Workout' with high confidence because it is a cool-down session designed for relaxation and letting worries fade, as highlighted by terms like 'cool-down' and 'reflect on your hard work.' The music, 'Sweet Creature' by Harry Styles and 'Hold My Girl' by George Ezra, supports this soothing and reflective vibe, aligning with the chill and introspective atmosphere typical of reboot sessions. The vibe 'The Meditative Grind' also fits with a moderate score due to the steady rowing format, encouraging a calm and focused mental state, suitable for both meditation and endurance rowing. No intense or distracting elements are present, hence other vibes, especially high-intensity ones, are excluded."
