  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is classified as 'Drive', which according to Hydrow-specific rules, implies that the Technique Difficulty is inherently 'Advanced'. However, since this conflicts with the user requirement labeled as 'Advanced', the only acceptable classifications are 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate' due to the workout being categorized under 'row'. With interval-based rowing at varying rhythms, the complexity slightly increases, supporting an 'Intermediate' level strongly.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 11:28 minutes and structured as a HIIT format involving 15, 30, and 60-second intervals at a high rhythm, the workout is quite demanding. The use of intense music further indicates an elevated intensity, and the max rhythm of 34 suggests high intensity. The overall design aligns with a 'Challenging' level with some characteristics of 'Extreme' due to the intense interval nature and high rhythm consistency.",
