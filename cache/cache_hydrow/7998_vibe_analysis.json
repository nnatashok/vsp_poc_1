  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is designed as a 'cool down' with an emphasis on technique, suggesting a calming and focused experience, fitting 'The Zen Flow' vibe with a score of 0.8. The use of pop ballads like 'Drivers License' and 'Glimpse Of Us' by Olivia Rodrigo and Joji further supports this calming, introspective atmosphere. The detailed focus on technique indicates elements of 'The Meditative Grind', warranting a score of 0.6 for its repetitive, zone-in quality. Finally, the workout's classification as a cool down aligns with 'The Reboot Workout', scoring 0.7, providing a relaxing reset post-exercise. The brief duration and lack of high-intensity elements exclude other intense or competitive vibes."
