  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Pop Pyramid Row' features 7-minute intervals, which suggests a steady rhythm and endurance focus, aligning well with 'The Meditative Grind' due to its emphasis on repetition and zoning in. The pop playlist, including upbeat and well-known tracks like 'Malibu' by Miley Cyrus and 'Perfect' by Ed Sheeran, adds an uplifting element, matching 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe due to the feel-good nature of the songs. The moderate workout intensity level of 1 out of 3 supports the notion of steady, enjoyable movement rather than high intensity or explosive energy. 'The Groove Session' is considered due to the pop music that may invite participants to enjoy the movement in a fluid and expressive manner. The workout's category and type ('Breathe' and 'row') suggest a focus on controlled, rhythmic breathing and motion, reinforcing the primary vibe choices."
