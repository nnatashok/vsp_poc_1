  "vibesExplanation": "The vibes classification for this workout is based on keywords and context from the metadata. The title 'Relaxed Hands Cool-Down' and the description 'Steadily row... focus in on relaxation' strongly suggest a calming and restorative session, aligning with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe (score: 0.8). Keywords like 'relaxation', 'cool-down', and 'steady' indicate this as a session designed for recovery, making it an extremely strong match.\n\nThe steady format and focus on relaxation are consistent with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, which emphasizes grounding and breath-centered exercises (score: 0.7). The use of calming music like 'dance mid' also supports this vibe.\n\n'With 'Max rhythm: 20' and 'standard,row', the workout involves repetitive motion and focus, which can be associated with 'The Meditative Grind', where there's a zoned-in, repetitive quality (score: 0.6). However, the emphasis on relaxation makes this less dominant.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Nightclub Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded due to the workout's low intensity and relaxation focus."
