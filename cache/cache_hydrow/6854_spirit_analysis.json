  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Short Slide Row' has a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the rowing activity taking place on a river, which aligns with nature-based settings and exploration. This is evidenced by the image showing a natural water environment. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also prominent, given the emphasis on technique and the focus on the connection between legs and core, indicating a methodical approach. The term 'technique-focused session' in the description supports this classification. Additionally, there is a 'Flow & Rhythm' element, suggested by the music genres such as 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' and the workout's rhythm of 30, indicating a coordinated connection with music. The 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Flow & Rhythm' spirits have a score of 0.8 and 0.6, respectively, reflecting their clear presence but secondary to the outdoor setting of the workout."
