  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Post-Row Stretch\" is explicitly focused on recovery and stretching, as indicated by both the title and description, which mention helping the body recover. This aligns closely with the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit, scoring high at 0.9. The image indicates that the setting is outdoors, next to a body of water, suggesting a connection to nature, which supports a secondary spirit of \"Outdoor & Adventure\" with a score of 0.6. The music choices, including Indie Alternative and Global Hits, add a relaxing and universal ambiance, further aligning with the restorative theme. There is less emphasis on intensity or structure, making other spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Structured & Disciplined\" unsuitable. The confidence in the \"Soothing & Restorative\" classification is high because the metadata consistently emphasizes relaxation and recovery. The outdoor setting, although implied rather than explicit, reasonably supports a moderate confidence level for \"Outdoor & Adventure.\""
