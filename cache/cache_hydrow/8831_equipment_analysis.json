  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for this workout clearly indicates the need for dumbbells, as they are explicitly mentioned in the equipment list and supported by the image showing their use. This gives a confidence score of 0.9, reflecting their central role in the workout's squats and potentially other upper body exercises. Additionally, the description mentions '2-minute intervals on Hydrow,' which implies the use of a rowing machine, as Hydrow is known for its rowing equipment. This is also supported by the second image, showing a rowing machine in use, contributing to a confidence score of 0.8 for the rowing machine."
