  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Making Moments Row' is primarily classified under 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the description emphasizing 'climb in rhythm and intensity' and the use of '90-second intervals' as 'moments.' The music selection of pop and global hits further supports this, encouraging a smooth and engaging pace throughout the session, leading to a score of 0.8. \n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also strongly present as the image shows rowing on a river, reflecting a natural outdoor setting, which gives it a score of 0.7. This environment aligns the workout with this spirit.\n\nFinally, 'High-Energy & Intense' is applicable due to the workout type 'sweat', a middling 'intensity level 2 out of 3', and the use of terms like 'climb' and 'intensity', suggesting a demanding session to some degree. This warrants a score of 0.6 for this spirit. Other spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were considered less relevant based on the available data."
