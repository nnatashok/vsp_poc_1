  "vibesExplanation": "The workout's name 'Happiness + Well-Being Row' and description focusing on what gives pleasure suggest a more mindful and positive approach. The interval rowing format and reference to \"happiness and pleasure\" align well with 'The Meditative Grind,' characterized by repetitive, endurance-based activities. This vibe is supported by the moderate intensity (level 2 out of 3).\n\nThe playlist containing uplifting and well-known songs like 'I Love Your Smile' and 'Higher Love' with genres from Dance and Global Hits adds elements of joy and motivation, aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave,' which involves elevated, feel-good energy.\n\nThe dance and global music hint at rhythmic enjoyment, justifying a mild inclusion of 'The Groove Session,' which is about fun, fluid movement. The lack of intense description or competitive elements ruled out stronger vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.'\n\nThis analysis integrates moderate confidence from the tonal emphasis and playlist selection, scoring high on 'The Meditative Grind' but acknowledging the lack of explicit musical energy specifications."
