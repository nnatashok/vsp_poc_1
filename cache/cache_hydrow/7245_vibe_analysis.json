  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Foam Roller Mobility' emphasizes foam rolling for warm-up or recovery, suggesting a focus on relaxation and releasing muscle tension. This aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which is about stretching and low-stress refreshment, backed by the 10-minute duration and mobility classification. The accompanying music from R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL and categories like 'On The Mat' indicate a calming, soothing environment, further supporting this vibe with a high confidence score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Deep Recharge' is applicable due to the focus on gentle, restorative movement and the stress-relieving nature of foam rolling. The dance and global hits music could add an element of enjoyment, but the primary mood is relaxation rather than energy, resulting in a score of 0.7. Other vibes, such as high-energy or competitive ones, are excluded because they don't fit the video's calming and restorative focus."
