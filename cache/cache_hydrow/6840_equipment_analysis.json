  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "Given the metadata, this workout is categorized under 'row,' explicitly indicating that a rowing machine is essential for participating in the workout. The inclusion of 'row' in the category, alongside 'Journeys' and 'standard,' confirms that the central activity involves rowing. Therefore, a rowing machine is required to effectively engage with this virtual rowing journey on the Hillsborough River. With no other equipment explicitly mentioned or implied, the confidence score for needing a rowing machine is very high at 1.0. This deduction aligns with platform emphasis on rowing workouts."
