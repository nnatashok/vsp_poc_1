  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata strongly indicates that a rowing machine is needed. The workout is categorized explicitly as a \"row\" and \"drive,\" both of which are closely associated with rowing machine exercises. The reference to maintaining maximum effort at varying rhythms and a max rhythm of 32 implies rowing cadence, a measure used during rowing workouts. Additionally, the instructor, Dani Hansen, is a Paralympic medalist known for her expertise in rowing, suggesting that the equipment central to this workout would be a rowing machine. Therefore, there is very high confidence that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
