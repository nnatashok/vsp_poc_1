  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily categorized under 'row', implying a lower technique complexity. The description highlights climbing intervals and stroke rates up to 26/minute, suggesting some level of coordination beyond basic rowing, hence a relatively strong fit for 'Beginner' (0.8) and a moderate fit for 'Intermediate' (0.6) due to slightly varied stroke rates.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of 31 minutes with climbs varying between strokes per minute from 20 to 26. The effort intensity level is provided as 1 out of 3, suggesting it is geared towards beginners or those with relatively low fitness levels. Thus, it strongly aligns with 'Moderate' (0.8) effort and has a reasonable fit with 'Light' (0.7) given its introductory nature for a climbing format.",
