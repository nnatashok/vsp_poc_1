  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout video is classified with both 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits due to several key elements. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is prominent given the use of interval training (\"cardio boosting intervals\") with music-driven pacing, indicated by the pop and global hits playlist; however, the session is low intensity (\"Workout intensity level: 1 out of 3\"), which aligns with a focus on rhythm and breath rather than intensity, justifying a score of 0.7. \n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is evident from the outdoor rowing setting shown in the picture provided. The channel's typical focus on rowing-based content and the featured outdoor environment also support this classification, earning it a 0.7 score. The indication that participants \"learn to listen to what your body is capable of\" further supports a focus on exploration and adaptation typical of outdoor sessions. This session appears less about high intensity or discipline, which influenced the exclusion of other potential spirits."
