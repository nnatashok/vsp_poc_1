  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Total Body Bootcamp' workout exhibits a clear \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit with a score of 0.85. This is supported by the term 'bootcamp,' which suggests a regimented and challenging series of exercises aimed at building 'strength and balance.' The workout description emphasizes structure through its goal of strength-building, which aligns with disciplined routines.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit scores 0.7 due to the image showing an outdoor setting by the water, and the exercise being conducted on mats outside. This environment encourages connection with nature, adding an exploratory and adventurous aspect to the workout, even if the category is 'On The Mat.'\n\nThe absence of high-intensity cues in the description or duration suggests the exclusion of the \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit. Meanwhile, the music selection is upbeat (Pop mid, Global Hits), encouraging motivation which complements both selected spirits rather than altering them."
