  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Express Bootcamp HIIT Row' and category 'row' explicitly suggest that a rowing machine is required. Additionally, the format is HIIT, and the image shows a person on a rowing boat. Combined with the high-intensity level and interval format, it is clear that the central equipment needed is a rowing machine, thus receiving a very high confidence score of 1."
