  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Reunion Row' and is categorized under 'row'. This strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. The description mentions 'catch up with Nick and Sera Moon as they return on the water together,' supporting the interpretation that rowing is the key activity. The interval format and focus on rhythm further align with typical rowing workouts. Due to the consistent mention of rowing-related terms, there is very high confidence that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
