  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Head of the Kevin Bow View,' which suggests a rowing context, supported by the description mentioning 'Race down the Charles River during the Head of the Kevin Regatta.' The categorization includes 'row,' indicating the centrality of rowing to this workout. As such, a rowing machine is required with very high confidence (0.9) because it is explicitly linked to the rowing activity described. The 'journey' type also aligns with a virtual rowing scenario. No additional equipment is explicitly mentioned or implied, making the rowing machine the sole necessary equipment for this workout."
