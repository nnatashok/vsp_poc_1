  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout takes place outdoors, on a river, which strongly supports the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit with a score of 0.9. This is further supported by the visual evidence of the natural setting. The format described as 'Interval' indicates a methodical approach, aligning well with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, assigned a score of 0.7. The inclusion of terms like 'athlete' and 'Olympian' in the description lends weight to a disciplined training approach. The 'max rhythm' and 'sweat' category suggest some intensity, but the setting and structured interval nature are more dominant. Other spirits, like 'Flow & Rhythm,' are less indicated due to a lack of continuous, dance-like movement emphasis."
