  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is strongly characterized by the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, as indicated by the title 'Signature Flow' and the description focusing on following 'Owen's cues through his signature flow.' The categorization under 'flow' further reinforces this with a focus on smooth, continuous movements that sync with the music. The music selection, including chill and downtempo tracks, supports a rhythmic, mind-body connection emphasized by the genre 'Chill mid' and artists known for melodic tracks like 'Max Richter' and 'Ry X.' Therefore, this spirit is assigned a score of 0.9 for a near-perfect match.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant. Although the session is 'On The Mat,' the image shows an outdoor waterfront setting, suggesting a connection to nature and environmental influence. This context adds an explorative element to the workout, resulting in a spirit score of 0.7. The outdoor component complements the flow of the workout, although it is not the primary focus, which is why it does not score as highly as 'Flow & Rhythm.'"
