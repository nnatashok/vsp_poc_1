  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Steady Cool-Down' is classified primarily under the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit with a score of 0.9. This is due to the setting described as rowing 'along the Charles River,' which fits the criteria for nature-based workouts leveraging environmental elements. The image confirms the outdoor river setting, aligning with the spirit.\n\nAdditionally, it strongly embodies 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.8, as indicated by the 'cool down' type and the slow, steady rowing pace (max rhythm: 20), promoting relaxation and recovery. The playlist featuring Taylor Swift's calming songs further supports this classification, creating a soothing atmosphere.\n\nLastly, 'Flow & Rhythm' is present with a score of 0.6, as the session involves smooth, continuous movement patterns highlighted by the phrase 'row steadily' and the music-driven pacing from the playlist.  These elements convey a mind-body connection typical of this spirit.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the moderate intensity and focus on relaxation."
