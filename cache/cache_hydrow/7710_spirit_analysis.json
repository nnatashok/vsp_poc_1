  "spiritsExplanation": "The classification of 'Outdoor & Adventure' as the primary spirit is strongly supported by the setting described as 'on the cliffs of Achill Island' which emphasizes a natural and adventurous environment. This setting aligns perfectly with the Outdoor & Adventure spirit, scoring a high 0.9 due to the explicit outdoor nature of the workout. \n\nAdditionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is a significant aspect of the workout, suggested by the Pilates focus which typically involves smooth, continuous movements and coordination. The playlist includes songs by Empire Of The Sun and R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL, which are known for rhythmic and flow-inducing music. These elements justify a score of 0.7 for this spirit as they contribute to a harmonious and rhythmic workout experience.\n\nThe absence of intense, structured, soothing, or sport-specific cues leads to the exclusion of other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', 'Soothing & Restorative', and 'Sport & Agility'. Overall, the environment and music strongly guide the spirit assessment."
