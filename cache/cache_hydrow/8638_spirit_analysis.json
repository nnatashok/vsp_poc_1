  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Newport Harbor Stern View', indicating a focus on rowing and visual exploration of a particular natural setting, which is Newport Beach, California. The description explicitly mentions exploring the shores, further emphasizing the environmental and scenic aspect of the workout. The categorization under 'journeys' aligns with an outdoor experience, implicitly suggesting adventure as participants virtually explore this locale. The lack of detailed technical or intensity-related instructions or workout structure supports the absence of structured, intense, or soothing spirits. Consequently, the score for 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is set at 1 because the content is a perfect embodiment of exploration and nature experience. The confidence level in this classification is very high (0.95) due to the explicit location and exploration description."
