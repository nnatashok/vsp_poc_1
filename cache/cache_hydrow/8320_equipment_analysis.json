  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under \"row\" and explicitly focuses on rowing with the reference to \"Prepare for Race Day Row\" and high-intensity intervals related to racing. The image provided also shows rowing being performed on the water, and in the context of the workout being on an indoor exercise platform, this strongly indicates the use of a rowing machine. This is why the confidence level for the required equipment being a rowing machine is rated very high at 1.0."
