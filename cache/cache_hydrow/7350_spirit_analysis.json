  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Dynamic Warm-Up' is primarily classified under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit (score: 0.75) due to its focus on warming up the body with mobility and bodyweight exercises, indicating an emphasis on gentle movement, relaxation, and preparation. The choice of music from dance and global hits genres suggests some elements of 'Flow & Rhythm' (score: 0.65), enhancing the fluidity and continuity of movement. The environment depicted in the image shows a natural outdoor setting, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.7), adding an element of nature-based exploration. The short duration and lack of equipment further support a more restorative and flow-oriented session without significant intensity or structure."
