  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Effort Focused Row' involves maintaining specific rhythms and controlling effort, indicative of a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (score: 0.8), particularly due to the interval format and the instruction focused on effort control. The presence of specified rhythms (20 and 26) suggests methodical pacing and precision. \n\nThe use of music, particularly tracks with flowing and rhythmic qualities, along with terms like 'rhythm,' aligns with a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.7). The music choices such as 'Levels' by Avicii contribute to maintaining a smooth, continuous movement pattern.\n\nThe image provided shows the session is conducted outdoors on a river, confirming the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.9), as it leverages a natural setting and the inherent challenges of rowing in open water.\n\nWhile the intensity level is relatively low, the focus on intervals and control keeps the workout structured rather than leaning towards a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit."
