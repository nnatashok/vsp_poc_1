  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Find Your Legs Row' takes place on the Charles River, clearly indicating an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, supported by the visual of rowing outdoors (score: 0.9). The metadata indicates a high intensity level (3 out of 3) and is formatted as intervals, aligning it with a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The playlist includes energetic tracks such as 'Don't Let Me Down (W&W Remix)' and 'Cry (Just A Little),' which further supports this classification (score: 0.8). The emphasis on rhythm (max rhythm: 32) and the music-driven nature of the workout also suggest elements of 'Flow & Rhythm,' though to a lesser extent, thus a moderate score (0.6). Other spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were considered but not selected due to the lack of emphasis on progressive structure or relaxation."
