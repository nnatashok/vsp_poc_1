  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row,' indicating a rowing theme. The title \"Steady State Row\" and the description, which mentions staying steady at specific rhythms, suggest sustained rowing activity. Despite the outdoor rowing setting in the image, the classification protocol for a 'row' category strongly implies the use of an indoor rowing machine for such workouts. Therefore, a 'Rowing machine' is required with a very high confidence score of 0.9, as this equipment is central to the workout's format."
