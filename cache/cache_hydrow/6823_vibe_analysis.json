  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Power HIIT Row' aligns strongly with 'The Firestarter' vibe, scoring 0.9. This is due to the short, high-intensity intervals described in the metadata ('hit short intervals at your sprint and max pace') and the max intensity level of 3 out of 3. The inclusion of dance and global hits music, such as 'Party Rock Anthem' and 'I Like To Move It,' contributes to 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe with a score of 0.8, emphasizing an energetic, music-driven experience. This upbeat music selection also enhances the 'party' atmosphere typical of a nightclub. 'The Adrenaline Rush' is also relevant, with a score of 0.7, as the description hints at a heart-pounding experience characterized by intense rowing and the exploration of Miami, providing a scenic and gripping challenge. The combination of these elements confirms a high-energy workout with strong emotional and experiential qualities."
