  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to phrases such as 'final countdown,' 'ultimate 20-minute test,' and 'push your limits,' which indicate a session focused on maximum effort and intensity. The mention of specific stroke rates ramping up from 26 s/m to 30 s/m implies a high level of exertion, further supporting this classification. The description's emphasis on achieving the 'best split yet' underscores the intensity and high-energy goal of the workout. \n\nThe presence of an outdoor setting on a river, as seen in the image, aligns well with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This natural environment, combined with the rowing activity, suggests an element of adventure and exploration, which fits this spirit with a score of 0.8. \n\nThe intensity of the workout and the environmental context lead to the exclusion of other spirits, such as 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Flow & Rhythm,' which are less emphasized in the metadata."
