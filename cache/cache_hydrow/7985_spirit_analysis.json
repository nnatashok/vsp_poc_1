  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Speed Builder Row' emphasizes high-intensity intervals, denoted by the '2-minute and 1-minute high-intensity intervals' in the description, as well as a 'max rhythm' of 28, which aligns with a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The inclusion of popular, high-energy songs such as 'Big Energy' by Latto further supports this categorization, resulting in a strong match score of 0.75.\n\nAdditionally, the visual imagery of rowing in a natural setting, along with the rowing category, indicates an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This is emphasized by the session being conducted on a river, which naturally involves environmental challenges and exploration, thus earning a strong confidence level and a score of 0.8 for this spirit.\n\nThe interval structure suggests elements of 'Structured & Disciplined,' but the overall focus on intensity and the outdoor nature predominates, excluding it from primary classification."
