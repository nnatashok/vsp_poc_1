  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Holiday Traditions Row' carries an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the location in Miami on water, as indicated by the accompanying image and the outdoor setting. This spirit is strongly represented by a score of 0.9 given the environmental context and holiday theme. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is present, scored at 0.7, as the workout emphasizes a 'consistent jogging effort' and includes a music playlist filled with rhythmic pop holiday hits. These elements align with a focus on rhythm and movement coordination. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is less applicable due to the relaxed nature of the intervals and low intensity. The use of festive and relaxed music further contributes to these chosen spirits, steering it away from high-intensity or technical precision-focused spirits."
