  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout session named '10-Stroke Builders Warm-Up' primarily embodies the 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is evident from the description of building in rhythm and the interval format, suggesting a focus on rhythmic and controlled motion in the rowing strokes. The mention of 'cruise along Newport Harbor' further emphasizes a smooth, coordinated activity. The interval structure with a max rhythm of 32 strokes complements this, solidifying a 0.75 score in this spirit.\n\nThe workout is filmed on water in Newport Harbor, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The environment adds an adventurous and explorative element to the session, hence a strong score of 0.8. The image reinforces the outdoor setting.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are less relevant here due to the warm-up nature and emphasis on rhythm and setting. The lack of intense interval signals or strict progressive structure minimizes their influence."
