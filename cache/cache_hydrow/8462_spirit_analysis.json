  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Core + Cardio Circuit' is characterized by a combination of elements that suggest both a high-energy and structured approach. The description mentions 'total body work' and '90-second intervals on Hydrow,' indicating a vigorous and fast-paced session, aligning with the High-Energy & Intense spirit. This is further supported by the upbeat music playlist featuring artists like The Weeknd and Drake, which is conducive to maintaining a high energy level.\n\nThe classification as a 'circuit' workout suggests a methodical and systematic approach, with structured intervals and exercises, highlighting elements of the Structured & Disciplined spirit. The use of 'dumbbells' further supports a disciplined approach, requiring attention to form and technique.\n\nAlthough the workout is categorized as 'On The Mat,' it does not take place in a natural setting, thus excluding the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. The energetic and rhythmic nature of the music and workout does not align strongly with Flow & Rhythm or Soothing & Restorative spirits."
