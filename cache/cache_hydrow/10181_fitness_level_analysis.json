  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The Technique Difficulty is classified as Intermediate with a high confidence score of 0.8. This is primarily because the workout type is 'drive' within a rowing context. According to Hydrow-specific rules, drive workouts inherently involve more advanced rowing techniques and rhythm changes, as evidenced by the climbing rhythm from 24 to 32 mentioned in the metadata. However, the classification aligns with the Hydrow rule that dictates technique difficulty for rowing can only be Beginner or Intermediate, despite the advanced nature of the workout description.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The Effort Difficulty is rated as Challenging, with a confidence level of 0.85. The workout is described as an 'advanced race piece' featuring 'climb in rhythm,' indicating a high-intensity rowing session. The maximum rhythm of 32 suggests sustained vigorous pacing, and an effort intensity level of 3 out of 3 further supports this classification. The 21-minute duration contributes to a significant energy expenditure, suitable for individuals with some fitness base but not necessarily beginners.",
