  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 6 minutes and 5 seconds, which is brief and indicative of a session focused on cooling down, reinforcing a 'Light' effort difficulty. The categorization as a 'cool down' and the steady max rhythm of 20 support the classification as low energy expenditure. Therefore, this workout is predominantly aligned with 'Light' effort difficulty, with minimal alignment towards 'Moderate' given the steady pace nature of rowing.",
