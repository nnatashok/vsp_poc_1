  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is \"Outdoor & Adventure,\" supported by the video being recorded on wild waters in Alaska. The setting strongly aligns with nature-based exploration as indicated in the title and description, justifying a high score of 0.9. \n\n\"Flow & Rhythm\" is also a significant element, with a focus on maintaining a rhythmic pace ('Climb in rhythm') and the integration of music-driven pacing, as evidenced by the playlist featuring artists like Kygo and The Chainsmokers. This supports a score of 0.7. \n\nAdditionally, the classification \"Soothing & Restorative\" applies, albeit less strongly. The workout is of low intensity (level 1 out of 3) and the \"breathe\" category suggests a focus on a calmer, breath-aware experience, which aligns with a score of 0.5.\n\nOther spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Structured & Disciplined\" are less applicable due to the lower intensity and lack of a rigorous training structure. \"Sport & Agility\" is also not a match since the focus is more on rhythm and exploration than sports-specific skills."
