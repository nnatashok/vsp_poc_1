  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Ride the Wave Row' and the category 'row' both explicitly indicate that this is a rowing-focused session. The description also mentions intervals, a common format for rowing workouts. The instructor's background as a collegiate rower further supports the focus on rowing. Therefore, the primary equipment needed is a 'Rowing machine,' supported by very high confidence (1.0) as its usage is central and explicit in the workout details."
