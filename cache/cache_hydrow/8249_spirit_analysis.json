  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is categorized primarily as a cool-down focusing on technique sequencing, which suggests a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, clearly aimed at relaxation and recovery, reflected in the lower rhythm (max 22) and technique emphasis. The technical description ('Focus on sequencing from your feet...' etc.) aligns with a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, involving precise movements and a detailed approach to form, meriting a score of 0.7. The music includes energetic tracks which, while not dominant, contribute to the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit by encouraging smooth movement. The outdoor setting suggests traces of an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, but the nature of the workout focuses more on technique and relaxation, thus emphasizing 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits."
