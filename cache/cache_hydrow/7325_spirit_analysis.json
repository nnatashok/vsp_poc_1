  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Club 26 Row' is best classified with an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.9), as evidenced by the image showing an outdoor river setting. This strongly suggests a connection to nature and exploration, fitting well with this spirit. The use of alternating 3' and 2' intervals also indicates a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (score: 0.7), reflecting methodical training and rhythm maintenance as outlined in the description ('hold a rhythm 26'). The presence of upbeat tracks from dance and global hits, combined with rhythmic rowing, points to a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.5), as the music likely drives coordination and continuity. However, the primary focus on interval training and rhythm maintenance slightly overshadows the continuous flow aspect, leading to a moderate score for 'Flow & Rhythm.' Other spirits, like 'High-Energy & Intense,' are excluded due to the moderate intensity level indicated (2 out of 3). The overall confidence in these classifications is high at 0.85 due to clear evidence from the metadata and image."
