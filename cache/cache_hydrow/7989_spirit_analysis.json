  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the indicators such as 'HIIT' (High-Intensity Interval Training) and 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3' which suggest a focus on pushing physical limits and achieving maximum effort. The inclusion of songs like 'What You Got' and 'Have It All', known for their upbeat tempos, further reinforces this energetic spirit. \n\nAdditionally, the mention of 'row in Norway' and the accompanying image showing a rowing scene outdoors contribute to the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This aligns with the classification as these elements indicate a nature-based, exploration-oriented experience. The combination of the high-intensity format with an outdoor setting makes this spirit relevant.\n\nWhile the use of music-driven motivation could hint at a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, the explicit emphasis on intensity and interval training overshadows this aspect, thus excluding it from the primary classification."
