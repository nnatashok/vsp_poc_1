  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Four Types of Focus Row\" combines elements that align with the \"Flow & Rhythm\" and \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirits. The use of a steady interval format with a max rhythm of 26 suggests a focus on pacing and coordination, fitting the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit, corroborated by the dance and global hits music playlist that supports a rhythmic flow. This is scored at 0.7 for its clear alignment.\n\nThe image showing rowing on a river strongly indicates an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. This is matched with a score of 0.7, as the natural setting plays a crucial role in the workout's character.\n\nThe \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit is mildly present with a score of 0.4 due to the \"breathe\" category and lower intensity, emphasizing a calming, focused breathing approach.\n\nOther spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" were not selected due to the lower intensity rating and calm pacing indicated by the jog and run instructions."
