  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', indicating rowing is central to the activity. The title 'Technique Focused Row' and the description referencing rowing along Lake Tahoe further emphasize a rowing-centric workout. Although the image suggests actual outdoor rowing, the context implies an indoor setup, which would require a rowing machine. Therefore, the confidence in needing a rowing machine is very high, at 1.0."
