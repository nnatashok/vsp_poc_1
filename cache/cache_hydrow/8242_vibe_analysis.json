  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Stay Present Row' emphasizes a steady rhythm and a low intensity, indicating a meditative and focused experience. The low max rhythm of 24 and the focus on 'breathe' in the workout type and category suggest a calm, repetitive nature. This aligns strongly with 'The Meditative Grind' (score: 0.75) as it embodies zoning in and letting repetition take over. The description of cruising along a river and listening to stories while working out points to a relaxed and mindful approach, fitting 'The Zen Flow' (score: 0.6) due to its grounding and intentional nature. \n\nThe playlist, featuring tracks like 'Waterfalls' and 'Turn Off The Light', provides an uplifting yet mellow ambiance, which marginally aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave' (score: 0.45). The music and easygoing storytelling might contribute to a feel-good, steady build in energy.\n\nOther more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush' are excluded due to the workout's low intensity and steady, non-explosive format."
