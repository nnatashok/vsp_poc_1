  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout takes place in an outdoor setting, as indicated by the rowing on a river environment seen in the image. This strongly suggests a connection to an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, earning a high score of 0.9. The use of upbeat and rhythmic songs like 'Can You Do This' by Aloe Blacc and 'Get The Party Started' by P!NK alongside the format of interval training aligns well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The focus on rhythm at a 'max rhythm' of 30 further supports this classification, marking a score of 0.7 for 'Flow & Rhythm'. The description emphasizes commitment and intervals rather than intense effort or structure, which led to the exclusion of 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits."
