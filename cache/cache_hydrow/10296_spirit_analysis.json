  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Discover Your Why Row' primarily embodies the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to its emphasis on gliding across the water, reflecting on personal motivations, and maintaining a rhythm max of 26. The description encourages participants to immerse themselves in the rhythm and purpose of their strokes, which is a hallmark of the Flow & Rhythm spirit. This spirit is assigned a score of 0.7 for its strong match.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is also present with a score of 0.6 because the workout is categorized as a 'sweat' session, indicating a high-intensity aspect. Additionally, the instructor's background as a high-energy kinesiologist and Olympian supports this classification, focusing on pushing limits and maximizing effort.\n\nAlthough the workout occurs on water, which typically suggests 'Outdoor & Adventure', this spirit only scores 0.4. The primary focus is on internal motivations and rhythm rather than exploration and interaction with varied environments, reducing the typical adventurous aspect of river rowing workouts. Thus, the Outdoor & Adventure element is present but not dominant."
