  "vibesExplanation": "The workout '90s Music Row' involves rowing with a focus on logging meters, which aligns with 'The Meditative Grind'. The steady format and low intensity level further suggest a repetitive and endurance-focused session. The playlist featuring nostalgic 90s songs provides a fun and engaging audio backdrop, which aligns with 'The Groove Session'. The combination of steady rhythm and engaging music allows participants to get lost in the music while maintaining a steady pace. The absence of high intensity and explosive elements excludes vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush'. Given the available metadata, the analysis leads to a moderately high confidence level."
