  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under \"row,\" which explicitly suggests the use of a Rowing machine as the primary equipment. The category 'row' implies that participants will engage in a rowing activity, likely using a rowing machine given the indoor context. Additionally, the term 'Stern View' in the title supports the rowing theme, as it is associated with rowing positions or perspectives in water-based rowing activities. The combination of the 'journey' type suggests a virtual rowing experience over a set duration, again necessitating a rowing machine. Therefore, Rowing machine is included with very high confidence."
