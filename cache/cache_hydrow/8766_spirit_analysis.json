  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'English Bay Bow View' along with its description \"Take a trip around English Bay as you explore Vancouver, Canada\" strongly indicates an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The phrase 'take a trip' and 'explore' suggests a dynamic and exploratory nature typical of outdoor settings, earning this spirit a score of 1.0 due to these explicit clues. The 'journey' type and category further reinforce that the workout involves travel or movement through a specific location, underscoring the outdoor aspect. Although there's no specific mention of rhythm, the involvement of rowing in a scenic view hints at an element of 'Flow & Rhythm,' as participants might be encouraged to synchronize their strokes smoothly through the scenic journey, justifying a lower score of 0.4. The lack of other details such as music or intensity suggests that no other spirits are dominant or relevant. This leads to high confidence in the primary classification of 'Outdoor & Adventure' with moderate clarity for 'Flow & Rhythm'."
