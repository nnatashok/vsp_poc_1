  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified mainly as 'The Warrior Workout' due to its high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format, with a max rhythm of 32 and an intensity level of 3 out of 3, suggesting a physically demanding session. This vibe is further supported by the 'drive' workout type, indicating a focus on intensity and power. The use of pop and energetic global hits adds to the vigor of the session.\n\n'Endorphin Wave' is considered because the workout involves steady build-up energy through rowing over a scenic Prague background, enhancing the feel-good aspect of the session. The interval-based format contributes to this vibe by allowing for intensive energy bursts followed by recovery, elevating endorphin levels.\n\n'Explorer's Workout' is also relevant due to the unique 'Destination' aspect of Prague, adding an adventurous and scenic exploration quality to the workout. This vibe is less prominent but still present, given the immersive outdoor setting. The lack of instructor guidance doesn't provide strong gamified or technical quality, thus ruling out vibes like 'The Competitor.'"
