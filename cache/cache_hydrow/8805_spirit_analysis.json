  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Childhood Memories Row', features rowing through Prague with a maximum rhythm of 24, suggesting a focus on steady and continuous movement, aligning with the Flow & Rhythm spirit. The description of rowing through a scenic city and recalling childhood experiences adds a storytelling and exploratory element, hence the association with Outdoor & Adventure, supported by its high significance in river rowing contexts. The low workout intensity (1 out of 3) and 'breathe' type also point towards a more relaxed, restorative approach, making Soothing & Restorative a relevant choice, albeit with a moderate confidence level. The music genres like 'Rock low' and 'Global Hits' imply a background musical rhythm that enhances the flow, rather than high energy intensity. Other spirits like High-Energy & Intense and Sport & Agility were excluded due to the workout's low intensity and focus on stories and scenery rather than performance."
