  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Neck + Chest Opening Align' is predominantly characterized as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a very high confidence score of 0.9. The title and description highlight a focus on releasing tension and tightness, which are clear indicators of a healing and relaxing session. The use of a towel, blanket, or yoga block also suggests a gentle, restorative approach. Additionally, the music playlist contains chill, downtempo tracks, reinforcing a calm and soothing atmosphere.\n\nThe setting of the workout in an outdoor environment, as shown in the image by the dockside with a cityscape view, adds an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, with a score of 0.7. However, the primary focus remains on relaxation and recovery, so the outdoor element is secondary to the restorative purpose of the session. The lack of specified high-intensity or structured sequences further supports the restorative classification."
