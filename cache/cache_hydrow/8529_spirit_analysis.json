  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title and description emphasize a 'Targeted Upper + Lower Body Circuit,' indicating a structured and disciplined workout with a specific focus on both upper and lower body exercises. The use of 'circuit' and 'EMOM' (Every Minute on the Minute) suggests a methodical and progressive training format, supporting a Structured & Disciplined spirit (score: 0.6). The playlist featuring high-energy tracks from artists like DMX and Kendrick Lamar, along with description notes like 'explicit lyrics' and the inclusion of hip hop/R&B music, aligns with a High-Energy & Intense spirit, as these elements contribute to a fast-paced, motivating workout environment (score: 0.9). Additionally, the mention of rhythm in 'Max rhythm: 26' and the music-driven environment adds elements of Flow & Rhythm as it focuses on coordinated, music-driven pacing (score: 0.7). The use of dumbbells and rowing ('on Hydrow') combines different types of movements, enhancing the rhythmic flow of the session."
