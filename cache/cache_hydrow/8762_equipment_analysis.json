  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is named 'All in One Row' and is described with terms such as 'row' and 'intervals', indicating rowing is the central activity. The presence of 'row' in both the workout type and category strongly suggests the need for a rowing machine. The image also depicts a rowing scenario, reinforcing the necessity of a rowing machine. Given these factors, the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high at 1.0."
