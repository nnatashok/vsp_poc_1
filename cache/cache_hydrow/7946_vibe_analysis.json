  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Efficient Speed Row' primarily fits 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe due to its focus on 'technique' and 'building speed' with specific coaching on stroke technique, earning it a score of 0.8 for its instructional emphasis. The 'Rock Mid-intensity' and 'Global Hits' playlists contribute to 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, aligning with a strong, beat-driven energy, though not overwhelmingly intense, scoring 0.7. Finally, 'The Meditative Grind' is also applicable (score 0.6), reflected in the steady row workout meant for endurance and focus on rhythmic and repetitive movement patterns. The intensity level, alongside session features, does not highly align with more dynamic or varied vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.' The scores reflect confidence in the class's instructional tone, rhythmic components, and endurance focus."
