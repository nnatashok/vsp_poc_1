  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily a cool-down, indicated by its name 'Spooky Ghoul-Down' and explicitly labeled as a 'cool down' in the description. This suggests a focus on relaxation and muscle recovery, which aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The relatively slow rhythm (max rhythm: 24) and the playlist featuring mellow songs like 'Traitor' and 'Enough For You' by Olivia Rodrigo further support this classification. A very high score of 0.9 reflects this strong alignment.\n\nThere is also a moderate emphasis on 'Flow & Rhythm' due to references to a steady format and a playlist that may encourage a continuous and smooth movement, hence scoring 0.6 for this spirit.\n\nFinally, the image showing the workout being conducted outdoors on a river supports a partial identification with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, albeit with a lower confidence. The presence of nature-based elements and the rowing activity give it a score of 0.5. The workout's theme and setting do not strongly match the criteria for 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Structured & Disciplined,' or 'Sport & Agility,' thus these spirits were not chosen."
