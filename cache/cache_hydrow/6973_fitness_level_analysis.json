Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is only 5 minutes and 52 seconds, indicating a very short and less demanding session. As a warm-up row, the focus is likely on preparing the body gently rather than exerting significant energy. The rhythm climb suggests a slight increase in intensity but maintains a light overall energy expenditure level. This aligns very strongly with a Light effort difficulty, making it accessible for entry-level participants.",
