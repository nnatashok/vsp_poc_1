  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Runner's Program #7 of 9' incorporates eight 1-minute intervals with a focus on rhythm and intensity, indicating an 'Endorphin Wave' vibe. The high-intensity level and motivating music featuring classic rock songs like 'Born To Be Wild' support this choice with a strong score of 0.7. The repeated intervals and endurance aspect align with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to the focus on locking into a repetitive effort, earning a score of 0.6. The playlist suggests a rhythmic and enjoyable session, slightly aligning with 'The Groove Session' vibe, hence a lower score of 0.4. The lack of explicit dance or expressive elements prevented a higher score for this vibe. The confidence level of 0.75 reflects the strong indicators from the interval format and music selection."
