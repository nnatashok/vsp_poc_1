  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Cardio Cruise Row' is characterized by its low intensity and longer duration, as indicated by the description emphasizing a 'low intensity, longer workout.' This aligns closely with 'The Meditative Grind,' which involves repetitive, endurance-focused exercises like rowing. The slow, steady rhythm and intention-focused description support this, scoring a strong 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Zen Flow' vibe is applicable due to the emphasis on breathing and intentional movement ('Workout Type: breathe'), suggesting a grounding and breath-centered experience typical of 'Zen Flow.' This scores a 0.6 as a noticeable element of the workout.\n\nThe playlist featuring classic rock and global hits, with artists known for melodic and immersive music, hints at a slight 'Groove Session' vibe, which is fun and expressive. However, this is less pronounced, with a moderate score of 0.4, as the workout's interval nature focuses more on consistency rather than dance-like fluidity.\n\nThe combination of these vibes indicates a workout that is steady and rhythmical, with a touch of expressive enjoyment brought by the music."
