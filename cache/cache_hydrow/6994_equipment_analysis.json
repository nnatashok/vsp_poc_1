  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title and description of the workout, 'Instructional: Hip Pivot' and 'Learn how to build power through your hip pivot with Aisyah during this drill from the Four Seasons in L.A.', suggest exercises that focus on building power through the hips. This is typically associated with rowing form. \n\nMoreover, the category includes 'row', which indicates a high likelihood of requiring a rowing machine for the exercise, providing a very high confidence level (1.0) for the need for a rowing machine.\n\nFurthermore, the image displays someone seated on rowing equipment, confirming its necessity for the workout."
