  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title 'False Creek Stern View' and description 'Explore downtown Vancouver from the waters of False Creek' strongly suggest an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the emphasis on exploration and a natural water setting. The term 'journey' and the use of 'Explore' further reinforce the adventuristic aspect, highlighting an experience that leverages the outdoor environment of False Creek. This strong alignment results in a high confidence level (0.9) for the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit.\n\nThe lack of specified music genre and emphasis on the natural setting suggest a moderate presence of 'Flow & Rhythm', as rowing naturally entails a rhythmic motion, especially in a scenic setting like False Creek. However, without explicit indicators of music-driven pacing or mind-body connection, the confidence level for this spirit is lower (0.5).\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', and 'Soothing & Restorative' are less applicable due to the focus on exploration rather than intensity, structure, or restoration. The emphasis on a scenic journey over performance diminishes the applicability of 'Sport & Agility', leaving 'Outdoor & Adventure' as the primary spirit."
