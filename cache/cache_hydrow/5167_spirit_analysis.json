  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'The New Normal Row' is classified under 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.8, as the description emphasizes climbing in rhythm and intensity, supported by an acoustic playlist. This suggests a focus on smooth, coordinated movements and a strong connection to music. Additionally, the workout is conducted outdoors on a river, directly matching the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, which references nature-based workouts. The visual of rowing on water further reinforces this classification, earning it a higher score of 0.9. Despite the 'breathe' category and moderate intensity (1 out of 3), the inclusion of a climb format indicates a gradual build, yet neither a soothing nor highly disciplined environment is heavily emphasized. Therefore, 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits are less applicable."
