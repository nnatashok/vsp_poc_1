  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The cool down session, lasting 5:44 minutes, aligned with a 'row' workout type typically indicates low energy expenditure focused on recovery rather than exertion. The description emphasizes a gentle pace ('gentle meters'), indicative of minimal physical demand. Therefore, the effort difficulty aligns strongly with a Light level, appropriate for a restorative activity following more strenuous rowing.",
