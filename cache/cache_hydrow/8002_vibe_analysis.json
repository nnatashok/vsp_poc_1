  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Climbing Intervals Row' primarily fits 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its focus on rhythmic intervals and rowing. The use of the word 'rhythm' in the description suggests a repetitive, focused grind, typical of endurance activities. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicates a moderate challenge that sustains engagement without overwhelming intensity. The second vibe, 'The Nightclub Workout,' is suggested by the playlist featuring high-energy, dance-oriented tracks like 'Walking On A Dream' and 'Levels.' These songs' upbeat and catchy nature aligns with a nightclub atmosphere. The combination of dance music genres such as 'dance mid' and 'global hits' further supports this vibe. The workout's short duration (11 minutes) and interval format accentuate its rhythmic and energetic qualities, justifying the dual vibe classification."
