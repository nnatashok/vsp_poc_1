  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout predominantly exhibits an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit, indicated by the setting shown in the image of rowing on a river. This aligns with the guideline that outdoor water-based rowing fits this spirit. The score of 0.85 reflects that the environment is a significant aspect of the workout.\n\nThe \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit is also a strong element, driven by the focus on maintaining a \"consistent pace\" and the music-driven nature of the workout, as highlighted by the use of a themed playlist and pop music genre. The playlist includes tracks like 'Cool For The Summer' and 'Cooler Than Me,' which suggest a rhythmic engagement, supporting a score of 0.75.\n\nAlthough the intensity is lower (1 out of 3) and the workout type is 'breathe,' there's no special emphasis on recovery or a structured workout protocol, thus excluding \"Soothing & Restorative\" and \"Structured & Disciplined\" as dominant spirits."
