  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is \"Structured & Disciplined\" with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is evident from the focus on technique development and speed building at the front end of each stroke as mentioned in the description. The use of the term 'technique-focused' suggests a methodical and precise approach, characteristic of this spirit. The intensity level being 2 out of 3 and the playlist featuring rock and global hits further supports disciplined pacing.\n\nThe secondary spirit is \"Outdoor & Adventure\" with a score of 0.7. The workout is conducted outdoors, as seen in the accompanying image of rowing on a river. This aligns with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit, emphasizing a connection with nature and utilizing environmental factors.\n\nThere is less evidence supporting 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the description's emphasis on technique over pure intensity or rhythm."
