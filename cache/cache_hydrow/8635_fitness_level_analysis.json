Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of over 20 minutes implies a moderate level of effort required. While it's a 'journey' category which might focus more on experience than intensity, continuous rowing still involves low-to-medium energy expenditure. For deconditioned users, maintaining a steady rowing pace for this period can be moderately challenging, thus scoring a higher Moderate level. The lack of rest intervals and sustained effort further align with Moderate difficulty, but it's not enough intensity for 'Challenging' due to its low-intensity focus.",
