  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'High Energy HIIT Row' conveys a strong 'Warrior Workout' vibe due to the focus on high intensity (level 3 out of 3) and the HIIT format, which typically involves sweat-dripping, heart-pounding effort, marked at 0.75. The use of intervals and the 80's and Global Hits soundtrack add to a dynamic feel but not necessarily electrifying enough for 'The Nightclub Workout'. The location description, 'Vltava River in Prague', and rowing element suggest a rhythmic, endurance-based aspect, aligning with 'The Meditative Grind', scored at 0.6. Finally, the mix of 80's hits like 'Friday I'm In Love' and 'Come To My Window' creates an upbeat, feel-good vibe synonymous with 'The Endorphin Wave', given a 0.55 score. The absence of a DJ or intense club atmosphere excludes 'The Nightclub Workout'. These inferences are well-supported by the metadata, offering a confident classification."
