  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Mind Over Matter Row' suggests both mental and physical challenge, typical of 'The Firestarter' vibe. The description highlights 'short, high-intensity intervals' with a 'max rhythm of 32,' aligning well with explosive and fast-paced workouts like HIIT. The intensity level of 3 out of 3 further supports this classification, earning it a high score of 0.8.\n\nThe use of pop and global music with songs like 'Take My Breath' and 'Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)' indicates a motivating and uplifting experience, which complements an 'Endorphin Wave' vibe, where elevated energy and feel-good movement are central, thus a score of 0.7.\n\nAdditionally, since rowing involves rhythmic repetition and focus, elements of 'The Meditative Grind' are present. The drive and standard row format, along with a playlist that includes motivating tracks, suggests a steady build in energy, though the emphasis on high-intensity impacts the score relative to more endurance-focused rows, resulting in a score of 0.6."
