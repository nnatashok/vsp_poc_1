  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Rainy Cardio Row' workout exhibits a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.9). Key evidence includes the setting in Alaska, as indicated by the description, which involves rowing and exploring natural environments.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.7) is supported by the format of lower rhythms with short bursts and the music choices that incorporate indie alternative and global hits, suggesting a rhythmic and engaging pace. Despite being an interval workout, the alternation between slow and fast rhythms enhances the flow aspect.\n\n'Soothing & Restorative' is a moderate fit (score: 0.5) due to the workout type 'breathe' and the low intensity level of 1 out of 3. These elements imply a calming and rejuvenating experience, even though there are bursts of higher intensity.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the low intensity and less focus on specific technical protocols."
