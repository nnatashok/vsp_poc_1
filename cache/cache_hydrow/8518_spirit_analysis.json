  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout is classified with multiple spirits based on its circuit format and recovery efforts. The 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit (0.75) is evident from the description's emphasis on 'total body work' with a circuit format and the inclusion of AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible), indicating a focus on maximizing effort and intensity over a short duration. The playlist featuring energetic tracks from artists like J Balvin and Daddy Yankee strengthens this classification by supporting a high-energy atmosphere.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (0.65) is relevant due to the circuit format and specific protocol of AMRAP, which suggests a methodical approach to the workout, demanding adherence to periodized training routines.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (0.5) is moderately present due to the rhythmic elements of the playlist with Latin and Global Hits, possibly influencing the pacing and coordination of movements. However, the structured format of a circuit with fixed recovery and work periods limits this classification, as it contrasts with a free-flowing session."
