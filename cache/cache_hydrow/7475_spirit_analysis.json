  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's name \"Power HIIT Row\" and description indicate high intensity with terms like \"sprint and max pace\" and \"high intensity intervals,\" aligning with the High-Energy & Intense spirit (score: 0.9). The format specified as HIIT, along with the maximum rhythm of 30, further emphasizes this intense nature. The chosen playlist, including remixes and popular global hits, suggests a rhythmic, music-driven experience, which aligns with the Flow & Rhythm spirit (score: 0.8). The image data, showing rowing in an outdoor setting, supports an Outdoor & Adventure classification (score: 0.5), although there are stronger indicators for an indoor, high-intensity session. Other spirits such as Structured & Disciplined and Soothing & Restorative are less relevant due to the workout's focus on intensity and rhythm rather than technique or relaxation."
