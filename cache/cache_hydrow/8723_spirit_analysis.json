  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Steady Cool-Down' and described as a heart rate reduction session along the Charles River strongly suggests a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, with a very high confidence score of 0.9. The mention of 'cool down' and a steady format aligns with relaxation and recovery goals. The environment, rowing along the river, adds a scenic and serene element conducive to relaxing exercises. \n\nA 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is considered due to the \u2018max rhythm: 24\u2019 indicator, suggesting a smooth, continuous movement with moderate confidence at 0.7. The playlist includes soft pop music which generally supports fluidity in workout sessions.\n\nFinally, the outdoor setting by the Charles River provides an 'Outdoor & Adventure' component with a score of 0.6, as workouts in natural environments often evoke an exploratory and invigorating feeling. The use of the outdoor photo supports this classification. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the emphasis on cooling down and a lack of intense or methodical training indicators."
