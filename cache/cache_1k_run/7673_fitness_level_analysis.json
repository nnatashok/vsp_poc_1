  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which according to Hydrow-specific rules limits the technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. Given the description of the session titled '80s Intervals Row', the emphasis is likely on maintaining rhythm and basic rowing form. The workout description and intensity cues like simple interval format support a Beginner level, while the category 'standard, row' suggests a potential for slightly more complexity characteristic of Intermediate. Thus, Beginner is the dominant classification due to minimal complexity involved in a standard rowing format at an intensity level marked 1 out of 3.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 21 minutes and 20 seconds with an interval format. The intensity level is marked as 1 out of 3, which suggests it is intended to be accessible to beginners. The interval setup can make it slightly more engaging, but not excessively demanding. Furthermore, the focus on 80's music hints at a light-hearted, enjoyable session rather than an intense training environment. Hence, Light difficulty is predominant because of the lower intensity and relatively short duration, but Moderate is partially applicable due to possible effort required in managing interval changes.",
