  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which limits Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. Given the 'breathe' workout type, it suggests a focus on rhythmic and calming movements, likely straightforward rowing strokes. The lack of specified complex movements or equipment further supports a Beginner level. There is a slight possibility for Intermediate due to the 'pyramid' format, but not enough evidence suggests significant complexity beyond basic rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 11-minute duration with a 'breathe' format and an intensity level of 1/3 points to a Light Effort Difficulty. The use of the term 'breathe' aligns with less physically demanding activity, and 'PYRAMID' refers to a gradual increase and decrease in effort, which might suggest slightly more exertion, aligning it partly with Moderate Effort. However, the short duration and low reported intensity favor a dominant Light effort classification.",
