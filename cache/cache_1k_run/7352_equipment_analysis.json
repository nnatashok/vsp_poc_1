  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Rev Your Engine Row,\" and the description involves moving from legs only into full strokes, which indicates rowing activity. The category includes 'row,' which suggests rowing as the primary workout type. This gives a very high confidence (0.9) that a rowing machine is essential for this workout. The image also shows a person rowing, reinforcing the need for a rowing machine. No other equipment is implied or mentioned in the metadata or description, so the classification focuses solely on the rowing machine as necessary."
