  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized primarily as a rowing session, placing it within Hydrow's specific guidelines where technique difficulty defaults to either Beginner or Intermediate. Given the workout's focus on rhythm and effort without complex maneuvers or equipment, it suggests a simpler technical requirement. Therefore, while the user's fitness level is Intermediate, the actual movements likely align more closely with Beginner-level execution, warranting a score of 0.7 for Beginner and 0.3 for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The interval format, with a relatively high max rhythm of 28 and a sweat classification, indicates a workout that pushes cardiovascular endurance, aligning with Moderate effort difficulty. With a workout duration of about 21 minutes and an intensity rating of 2 out of 3, this suggests a Moderate effort level with notable energy expenditure. The structured intervals introduce a Challenging aspect, justifying a score of 0.6 for Moderate and 0.4 for Challenging.",
