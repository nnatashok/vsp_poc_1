  "spiritsExplanation": "The '2022 Wrapped Row' workout is classified primarily with a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, scoring 0.8, due to its high intensity level (3 out of 3) and advanced user fitness level requirement. The format 'Climb' and max rhythm of 28 indicate a vigorous pace. The use of 'Drive' in the category suggests a focus on powerful, dynamic efforts.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.6. The workout takes place in Newport Beach, a specific outdoor location, suggesting an element of exploration and environmental engagement, typical of this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' receives a score of 0.5 because of the rhythmic component inherent in rowing combined with the reference to music, specifically '00s Hits mid to high' and 'Global Hits,' which may emphasize tempo-driven movement.\n\nOther spirits were excluded. 'Structured & Disciplined' was not chosen due to the absence of specific protocol mentions, and 'Soothing & Restorative' is inapplicable given the intensity level. 'Sport & Agility' is not indicated due to lack of sports-specific training elements."
