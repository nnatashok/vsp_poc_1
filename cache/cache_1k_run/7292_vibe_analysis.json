  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is clearly a rowing session, placing emphasis on positivity and consistency, which aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' (score: 0.7). The repetition in interval format allows participants to zone in and focus on the rhythm of rowing. The inclusion of energetic rock songs suggests an elevated, feel-good energy that aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave' (score: 0.6). Additionally, the music-driven element of rock with intervals suggests the 'Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe (score: 0.5), as it infuses strong beats with rowing. The workout intensity level of 3 out of 3 supports these vibes, indicating a challenging yet repetitive and music-driven experience. However, the absence of explicit gamification elements or high variability means 'The Competitor' or 'The Adrenaline Rush' were not considered."
