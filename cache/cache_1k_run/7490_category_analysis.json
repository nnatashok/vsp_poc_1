  "categoriesExplanation": "The metadata for the video 'Club 26 Warm-Up' strongly suggests that this workout is primarily an Indoor Rowing session. The description explicitly mentions it prepares users for a 'Club 26 Row,' indicating that rowing is a central component. The goal is to 'quickly increase your rhythm and effort,' which aligns with a warm-up typically focused on preparing muscles for more intense rowing exercises. Although labeled as a 'warm-up,' the mention of a specific rowing session following this workout reinforces its classification as Indoor Rowing. The scoring of 0.9 reflects the strong presence of rowing elements and the lack of ambiguity in the provided details."
