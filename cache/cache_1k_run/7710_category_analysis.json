  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as a 'pilates session' in the title and description, indicating a central focus on Pilates exercises, leading to a high confidence score of 0.9 for the Pilates category. Additionally, the tags 'On The Mat' and 'standard' support the classification into the 'Mat' category, as Pilates often involves exercises on a mat, though not exclusively. Hence, a score of 0.7 is assigned to the Mat category. The duration (10 minutes and 41 seconds) hints at a focused, concise session, typical for Pilates and mat-based workouts. The absence of required equipment further supports these categorizations, as mat Pilates typically emphasizes bodyweight exercises."
