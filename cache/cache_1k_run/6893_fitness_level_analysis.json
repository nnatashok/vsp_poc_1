Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts less than 6 minutes, which is substantially brief and falls under the 'warm-up' category, suggesting low energy expenditure. 'Intervals' and 'climb in rhythm' hint at an increase in heart rate but within a manageable intensity. These factors position the effort difficulty strongly in the Light category, suitable for beginners preparing for more intense workouts. The Moderate level is possible due to the rhythmic element and interval nature, but likely manageable for beginners.",
