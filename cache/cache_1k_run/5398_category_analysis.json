  "categoriesExplanation": "This workout is classified as 'Indoor rowing' with very high confidence due to the explicit reference to 'rowing' in both the workout name ('Power Climb Row') and description ('hear about James' start to rowing'). The description emphasizes rowing technique ('Drive through your legs as you climb in rhythm'), affirming that the workout involves rowing. The format 'Climb' suggests a structured rowing session, likely involving intervals or gradual intensity increases. The workout intensity level is medium (2 out of 3), and the mention of 'max rhythm: 26' suggests a focus on stroke rate, which is typical for rowing workouts. The absence of other exercise descriptors or equipment confirms that this workout is not likely to involve exercises from other categories."
