  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video titled \"Flow + Restore\" strongly suggests a yoga-oriented session, indicated by the terms 'Flow' and 'Restore' in both the title and description. The description further clarifies the session involves moving through a flow and engaging in restorative poses, which are typical of yoga practices, leading to the classification under the Yoga category with a score of 0.7. The Chill low and Cool/Downtempo genres of the music playlist support a relaxing atmosphere akin to yoga.\n\nAdditionally, the session is described as 'On The Mat' and 'standard', suggesting stretching elements often associated with yoga sessions to aid flexibility and relaxation. This warrants a classification under Stretching with a score of 0.6 as it complements yoga practices by enhancing body flexibility.\n\nThe exclusion of categories such as Mat exercises or Meditation is due to the explicit reference to yoga flows and restorative poses as the main focus, rather than general mat exercises or a purely meditative practice."
