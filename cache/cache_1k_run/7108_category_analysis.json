  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Power Strokes Warm-Up' and categorically described with tags like 'warm-up' and 'row' strongly indicates a focus on rowing exercises, placing it in the 'Indoor rowing' category with a high confidence score of 0.9. The terms 'quick and powerful strokes' and 'interval' format suggest elements of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), likely focusing on short bursts of intense activity typical in HIIT workouts. Thus, the 'HIIT' category is also applicable with a score of 0.7. While stretching or general mat workouts could theoretically apply to a warm-up, the specific mention of rowing and intervals solidly defines the primary activities, excluding other categories."
