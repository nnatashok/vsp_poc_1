  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout title 'Looking After Yourself Cool-Down' and description suggest a focus on recovery and relaxation, typically following more intense physical activity. The term 'cool down' indicates reduced intensity exercises to help the body transition back to rest. However, the category tag 'row' directly points to rowing as an element, suggesting that light rowing is involved.\n\nTherefore, 'Indoor rowing' is selected as the primary category with a strong score of 0.8 due to the explicit mention of rowing. The sub-20 rhythm and 'cool down' further imply a relaxed pace of rowing, aligning with low-intensity rowing exercises.\n\n'Cool Down' might also involve elements of light stretching exercises, which complements the Indoor rowing recovery focus. Hence, 'Stretching' is considered with a moderate score of 0.5 to account for the stretching-like nature of cool-down activities.\n\nThe tags and format indicate a steady, low-impact workout reinforcing the categorization as 'Indoor Rowing'. Other categories like 'Yoga', 'Meditation', or 'Breathing exercises' aren't applicable due to the clear emphasis on rowing-related cool-down exercises."
