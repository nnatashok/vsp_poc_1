  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'All in One Row' seems to embody 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its emphasis on interval rowing over a 31-minute duration, indicative of a repetitive, focused exercise. The format 'interval' and duration suggest endurance, fitting this vibe well. This is assigned a score of 0.75 for its clear representation of enduring, rhythmic rowing.\n\nThe vibe 'The Endorphin Wave' is also relevant, supported by the workout's 'intensity level 3 out of 3' and music from enthusiastic playlists like '90's, Global Hits.' These elements imply a steady build of energy and positive movement, warranting a score of 0.65.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' is considered due to the strong beat-driven tracks such as 'Greyhound' by Swedish House Mafia and other rhythmic songs that are likely to drive the workout rhythm. This vibe scores 0.6 as it fits the beat-driven and strong nature of rowing workouts."
