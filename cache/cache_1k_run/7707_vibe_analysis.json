  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Rhythm 18 Row' workout is best classified under 'The Meditative Grind' vibe given the steady rhythm pace and the focus on patience, which suggests a repetitive, endurance-focused exercise. The description includes 'breathe' and 'steady,' indicating a calm and controlled session, reinforcing the meditative quality. The inclusion of 'breathe' and light intensity level further support this vibe at a high confidence level of 0.9.\n\n'Zen Flow' is also applicable, though with lower confidence (0.7), as the calm music selections and focus on breathing suggest a grounding and intentional session. The use of 'jogging pace' and 'breathe' language aligns well with a Zen-like rhythmic movement.\n\nLastly, 'The Reboot Workout' is a possible match at a moderate confidence level (0.5), supported by the low intensity and breath-focused approach that hints at a refreshing and less demanding physical routine. The music choice and pacing enhance a calming and rejuvenating experience typical of a gentle restart."
