  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'cool down' with a short duration of 5:43 minutes, suggesting low energy expenditure, typical of light intensity activities. The use of soothing music genres like Pop low further supports a relaxed, light-intensity effort requirement. Therefore, it is strongly aligned with 'Light' effort difficulty due to its short duration and cool-down nature, which involves gentle effort to relax the muscles post-exercise.",
