  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing interval session, which inherently consists of repetitive rowing movements. Rowing can be considered a low to moderate complexity activity because it involves a straightforward motion pattern. Relatively, for 'row' workouts like this one, technique difficulty typically ranges from Beginner to Intermediate. Given the description of the workout led by an Olympian with focus on intensity and rhythm, the technique difficulty can be rated between Beginner (as straightforward rowing) and Intermediate (due to the need for maintaining proper form during intervals).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout runs for 21:19 minutes and is categorized under 'sweat' with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, designed around interval training set to a lively-80s playlist. Interval training usually increases effort requirements due to higher intensity periods interspersed with short recovery times. While the Olympian coach and the stimulating music can push participants to higher energy levels, it aligns more with Moderate effort for someone deconditioned and could reach Challenging for complete beginners, necessitating significant energy output.",
