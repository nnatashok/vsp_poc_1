The workout name 'Split Control Row' explicitly includes 'Row,' indicating a rowing exercise.\n2. The workout description mentions managing power output and speed ('Control your power output with James as you start at a steady pace and gradually increase speed while managing your split'), which are typical aspects of an indoor rowing session.\n3. The categorization tags include 'row,' further supporting the assignment to the Indoor rowing category.\n4. The equipment section is empty, implying reliance on a rowing machine, which fits the 'Indoor rowing' classification.\n5. The workout intensity level indicates a moderate to high level, which aligns with common indoor rowing workouts.\nHigh confidence (0.9) is assigned due to explicit indicators like the use of 'Row' in the title and description which heavily suggest rowing-focused content, while scoring Indoor rowing at 1 because it is the central defining characteristic."
