  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout focuses on rowing-specific leg progressions, which can range from basic to slightly complex movements. Given the 'Technique' format and 21-minute duration, the exercises are likely structured to improve form rather than introduce highly complex movements. The workout type 'row' sets a base for a Beginner to Intermediate level of technique difficulty, aligning with standard rowing techniques that require less complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of approximately 21 minutes coupled with a max rhythm of 28 suggests a moderate intensity level. The instructor's focus on form and empowerment, along with an intensity tier of 2 out of 3, indicates that users will exert moderate effort. The 'sweat' type and tempo set by the music support a level that is moderately demanding, yet somewhat accessible for users in lower physical shape.",
