  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'sweat' and involves rowing with a focus on 'legs-only progressions', indicating a specific subset of rowing that requires some coordination but is not overly complex. The use of the term 'Focus on your form' suggests an emphasis on maintaining proper rowing technique, which aligns with Intermediate difficulty, while the 'legs-only' progression suggests a simpler motion that aligns with a Beginner level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 21 minutes and involves rowing, which can be physically demanding. The intensity level is 2 out of 3, suggesting it requires moderate effort but not excessive. The use of descriptions like 'sweat' and the context of maintaining 'form' indicate moderate energy expenditure, while a max rhythm of 28 could incrementally increase cardiovascular and muscular demand, supporting a secondary Challenging classification.",
