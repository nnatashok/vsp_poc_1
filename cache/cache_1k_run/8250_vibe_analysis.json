  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for 'Legends of Prague Row' is 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.7. The workout focuses on rowing, which is a repetitive endurance activity, fitting the 'Meditative Grind' vibe, especially given the longer duration of 21 minutes and interval format. The vibe is further supported by the focus on in-depth technical detail and consistent pace and rhythm (max rhythm 30). The 'Endorphin Wave' is also relevant with a score of 0.6 due to Dani's high energy and the feel-good nature of the workout, fostering a steady build of energy. The workout's interactive storytelling element suggests a fun and engaging experience, aligning partially with 'The Groove Session' scored at 0.5, as it involves creative thinking and narrative immersion (guessing legends). The indie and global hits background music complements this engaging narrative style, but lacks the full fluid expressiveness of a dedicated dance session, hence the moderate score. The confidence level is 0.7, given clear indicators but lacking explicit intensity markers for a more intense vibe."
