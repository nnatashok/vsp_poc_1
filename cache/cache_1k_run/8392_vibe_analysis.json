  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Standing Dynamic Mobility' is identified primarily with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, as the description emphasizes warming up gradually without high intensity, fitting the idea of a total-body refresh. The mention of 'mobility' further supports this vibe. The score of 0.7 reflects the alignment with being gentle and restorative.\n\nThe second vibe identified is 'The Zen Flow', scored at 0.6, highlighting its grounding nature and breath-centered flow. The keywords 'gradually warm-up' and focus on dynamic mobility contribute to this vibe. The absence of intense equipment or movement indicates a calm experience, typical of Zen practices.\n\nThe pop and global hits musical selection suggests a lighter atmosphere, reinforcing these vibes without leaning towards high intensity or fast rhythm workouts. There was not enough intensity data to consider vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter'. Confidence is moderate to high due to the general alignment of the workout type and music with these vibes."
