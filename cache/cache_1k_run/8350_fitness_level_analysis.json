  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a rowing session, which by platform rules means technique difficulty can be rated as either Beginner or Intermediate. The format 'Steady' and intensity 'Sweat' suggests a consistent yet manageable pace. While rhythm '26' could imply some coordination, such movements remain relatively straightforward. Thus, Beginner is strongly aligned, but Intermediate has moderate alignment due to rhythm coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 31 minutes long, with 20 minutes specified at a Sweat intensity, suggesting increased physical demands. The intensity level given is 2 out of 3, aligning more with Moderate difficulty due to its sustained intensity with variable effort across warm-up and cool-down phases. Challenging also fits moderately, given users with low fitness would find 20 solid minutes of rowing demanding.",
