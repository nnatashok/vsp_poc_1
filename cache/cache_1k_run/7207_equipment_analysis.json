  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', strongly indicating the need for a rowing machine. The title 'Speed Splits Row' and the description talking about reaching fast speeds and high-intensity intervals with instructor Nick further support that the primary equipment required is a rowing machine. The image shows an individual rowing on water, but the urban, fitness context of the workout suggests the exercise translates to an indoor rowing machine. Confidence is very high at 1.0 for this equipment."
