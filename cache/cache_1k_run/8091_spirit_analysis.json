  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit for this workout is 'Outdoor & Adventure' with high confidence (score: 0.9). The title 'Race on the Charles' and description emphasize rowing on the Charles River, which is a natural outdoor setting. The presence of Olympians and the iconic course further highlight the adventure aspect. The imagery confirms a real river setting.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'High-Energy & Intense' with strong confidence (score: 0.8). The description and metadata indicate a maximum rhythm of '30,' a 'format: Climb,' and an intensity level of '3 out of 3,' all of which suggest a high-energy, intense workout. The playlist includes energetic songs such as 'Turn Down For What' and remixes that typically align with high-intensity sessions.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are unlikely given the competitive and intense nature of the session. The workout's structure and focus do not emphasize precision or technical progression, thus 'Structured & Disciplined' is not selected."
