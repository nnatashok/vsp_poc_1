  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata explicitly categorizes this session under 'row,' indicating that it is based on rowing. Additionally, the image shows a person rowing on water, aligning with this category. Therefore, the use of a rowing machine is essential for replicating this activity in a standard setting. The confidence in this requirement is very high due to the direct association with rowing in both the metadata and visual content."
