  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description explicitly mentions 'intervals on Hydrow', which is a rowing machine, indicating very high confidence (1.0) that a rowing machine is required. Additionally, the equipment section explicitly lists 'Dumbbells' with an ID and tag group, affirming the necessity for dumbbells in this workout with very high confidence (1.0). The image further supports the use of a rowing machine, as it shows an individual engaged in rowing. Therefore, both the rowing machine and dumbbells are essential for this workout."
