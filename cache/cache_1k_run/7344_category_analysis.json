  "categoriesExplanation": "The metadata strongly indicates that this workout is best categorized under 'Indoor rowing' and 'HIIT'. The title, 'Highs and Lows Row', and the description, which includes phrases like 'steady rhythm' and '3-minute intervals before picking up the pace for 30-second sprints', are clear indicators of a rowing workout involving interval training, commonly associated with HIIT. The use of a 'max rhythm: 26' and 'endurance' format further suggests a rowing focus. Though the term 'endurance' suggests a sustained effort typical of indoor rowing, the '30-second sprints' imply intervals characteristic of HIIT. The workout intensity level is 2 out of 3, suggesting it is moderately intense, supporting the HIIT classification. The music, which includes upbeat genres like Global Hits, is often used to maintain a motivational rhythm, further reinforcing these activities. No other categories, such as Yoga or Pilates, were applicable as there was no suggestion of practices related to flexibility or body alignment."
