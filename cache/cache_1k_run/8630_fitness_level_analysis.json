  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'drive' and is focused on rowing, which aligns with Hydrow-specific rules where 'Drive' signifies an advanced technique difficulty. Furthermore, the use of high-intensity intervals and complex rhythm changes during rowing elevates the requirement for good coordination and body awareness, supporting an advanced classification for technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is presented in a HIIT format with 80-second intervals and is noted to feature maximum rhythm climbing up to 30. This high-intensity setup, combined with a top-tier workout intensity level of 3 out of 3, indicates a very demanding session. The 21-minute duration of continuous hard effort also supports an extreme effort classification due to the requirement for sustained high energy expenditure with likely minimal rest periods.",
