  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of this Pilates session is approximately 11 minutes, and the exercises focus on core engagement while lying on the back, suggesting a lower physical intensity. This alignment is consistent with light effort difficulty, which is typical for core-based low-impact exercises. However, Pilates can require moderate muscle endurance, justifying a small score of 0.2 for Moderate difficulty.",
