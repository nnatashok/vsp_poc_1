  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session duration is 10 minutes and 43 seconds, which is relatively short, indicating a lower overall energy expenditure. As it only targets core activation on the mat, the session likely has light to moderate intensity, suitable for less fit users. Music genres suggest a lively pace, but without more intensive movements or long duration, it aligns more with Light to Moderate effort.",
