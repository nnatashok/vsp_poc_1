  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing session, automatically classifying it at a Beginner or Intermediate level per the guidance. Given that it's categorized under 'sweat' and described as being fairly standard, the rowing technique itself is likely to be simple and does not include any additional technical or coordination challenges. Therefore, the primary classification is Beginner, considering the general nature of rowing as an accessible exercise for most.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 21 minutes long with an interval format, suggesting periodic increases in intensity, which is consistent with a 'sweat' type workout. The intensity level is 2 out of 3, indicating moderate demand. The max rhythm of 29 signals a substantial rowing pace which could challenge less fit users, but the duration restricts it from being extremely challenging. Hence, the effort difficulty falls primarily under Moderate, with some elements of Challenge due to the interval nature.",
