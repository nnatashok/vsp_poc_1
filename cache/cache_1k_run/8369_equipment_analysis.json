  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'On The Mat' which implies the use of a mat is central to the exercises, giving it a high confidence score of 0.8. Additionally, the description recommends a 'thick towel, blanket, or yoga block,' indicating that blocks could be useful, especially for support in stretching exercises that focus on chest and neck alignment. Thus, yoga blocks have a confidence score of 0.7, as they are mentioned explicitly as a recommendation and can benefit the advertised neck and chest release exercises."
