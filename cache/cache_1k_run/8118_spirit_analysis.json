  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Quick Bursts Row' is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the keywords such as 'Quick Bursts,' 'HIIT,' and 'intensity level: 3 out of 3' in the metadata. These indicate a fast-paced and strenuous session designed to push participants to their limits with high rhythmic activity. The choice of music, which includes energetic tracks from genres like dance and global hits, supports this classification by keeping the energy level high. \n\nAdditionally, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also a strong match. The imagery of rowing on a race course in Norway shown in the image emphasizes the outdoor and exploratory nature of this workout. The natural setting and real-world environment enhance the adventurous aspect of the exercise, which is clearly a significant component.\n\nFlow & Rhythm was not chosen due to a lack of emphasis on smooth movement patterns or continuous flow, and the 'Structured & Disciplined' aspect isn't strongly highlighted in the metadata provided."
