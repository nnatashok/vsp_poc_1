  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'row', allowing for a maximum Technique Difficulty of Intermediate. Given the format is 'Pyramid' and intensity level is 2 out of 3, it suggests slight complexity due to variable rhythms. However, as a rowing workout, the base technique remains relatively simple, aligning primarily with Beginner and partially with Intermediate coordination challenges.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 16-minute duration and pyramid format imply moderate exertion, typical for an effort focused on consistent rhythm and tempo changes, indicative of a light to moderate cardio demand. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggests the workout involves significant effort, tilting it slightly towards Challenging for deconditioned users. Keywords like 'sweat' imply exertion consistent with Moderate to Challenging difficulty.",
