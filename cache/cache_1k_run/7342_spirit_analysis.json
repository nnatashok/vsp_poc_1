  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as indicated by keywords such as 'gently release,' 'post-row mobility session,' and the focus on 'lower back and shoulders.' These elements suggest a focus on recovery, relaxation, and stress reduction, aligning perfectly with this spirit. The description and brief duration (5 minutes 47 seconds) further support this classification, emphasizing a gentle approach.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant since the workout is conducted outdoors near a river, as evidenced by the accompanying image showing the participants in a natural setting. This suggests an engagement with the environment, typical of the Outdoor & Adventure classification.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the lack of emphasis on continuous movement patterns, coordination, or methodical training protocols. The absence of high intensity and sports-specific skills ruled out 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility.'"
