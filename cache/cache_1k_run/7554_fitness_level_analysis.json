Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is largely Light due to the short duration (about 11 minutes) and the noted purpose as a cool-down, which inherently implies low energy expenditure and intensity. There is some support for a Moderate level given the potential for mild cardiovascular engagement during rowing, but the primary aim remains recovery and technique reinforcement, thus strongly favoring a Light classification.",
