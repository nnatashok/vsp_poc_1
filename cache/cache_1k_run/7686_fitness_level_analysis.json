Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Although designed as a warm-up, the interval format and focus on increasing heart rate indicate some degree of moderate exertion. The short duration of 5 minutes supports the Light rating, but the intention to raise heart rate slightly elevates the demand. Thus, it is assessed primarily as Light, with a supplementary Moderate classification due to increased rhythm and effort slightly higher than typical light exertion.",
