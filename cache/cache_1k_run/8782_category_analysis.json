  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Postural Mobility' and described as involving \"mobility, flexibility, and movement with Pete during bodyweight exercises,\" which directly suggests exercises that improve range of motion and posture, typically associated with stretching. However, the metadata also specifies 'On The Mat' which aligns with activities typically performed on an exercise mat, reinforcing the primary classification as a mat workout. The term 'mobility' combined with 'bodyweight exercises' strongly indicates low-intensity movement exercises done on a mat or floor, fitting well within both the 'Mat' and 'Stretching' categories. The lack of equipment listed supports a mat-based workout style. The playlist consists of popular music, typically not indicative of high-intensity workout but suitable for a relaxed pace, as might be found in a mat or stretching session."
