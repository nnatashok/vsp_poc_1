  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is largely rowing-focused, falling under the categories 'breathe,' 'standard,' and 'row.' According to the rules, rowing workouts can either be Beginner or Intermediate in difficulty. The metadata suggests a rhythm-focused session at a manageable max rhythm of 24, which aligns with Beginner level characteristics due to straightforward rowing movements. However, an interval format may require brief adjustment to change pace, introducing a slight complexity, nudging the technique into the lower Intermediate range.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 21 minutes and 33 seconds, along with a mid-range rhythm and interval format, imply a workout that is not overtly strenuous but requires consistent effort. The intensity is marked as 1 out of 3, which suggests that the overall physical demand is on the lower side, better aligning with Moderate or Light effort levels. However, intervals often provide a slight challenge, hence scoring on the higher side of both Light and Moderate effort difficulty, reflecting the likely perceived exertion for deconditioned users.",
