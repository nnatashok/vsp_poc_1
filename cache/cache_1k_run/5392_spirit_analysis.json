  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Master Your Chaturanga\" strongly indicates a \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit. The emphasis on poses like plank, low plank, and chaturanga suggests a continuous, smooth flow between movements. The playlist, featuring artists like AlunaGeorge and R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL, known for rhythmic and ambient music, supports this classification. The workout's emphasis on alignment hints at a moderate \"Soothing & Restorative\" element, focusing on relaxation and controlled movement. The outdoor snowy environment captured in the image, along with the phrase \"activate your core,\" introduces an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" aspect, as it utilizes natural surroundings to enhance the experience. Overall, the combination of music, setting, and described exercise flow supports these classifications, with \"Flow & Rhythm\" being the dominant spirit."
