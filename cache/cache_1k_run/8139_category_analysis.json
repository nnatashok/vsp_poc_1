  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Rock Row' is classified primarily as 'Indoor rowing' based on the clear indication from the title and the description, which emphasizes rowing with 'higher rhythms with Buffy.' The tag 'row,' and 'Climb' format further suggests an indoor rowing session. The description highlights pushing beyond comfort zones, aligning with intense rhythmic rowing, making it suitable for the 'Indoor rowing' category with a strong score of 0.9 due to explicit rowing-related terms.\n\nAdditionally, the workout can be classified under 'HIIT' with a score of 0.7. This is due to the 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3,' indicating a high-intensity session, coupled with the 'Format: Climb,' suggesting varying intensity, akin to interval training. The rock music playlist featuring high-energy songs and the intention to push one's limits are indicative of HIIT-like characteristics.\n\nOther categories like 'Mat' or 'Body weight' were excluded due to the evident lack of any related descriptors in the metadata, and the focus clearly being on rowing and its intensity."
