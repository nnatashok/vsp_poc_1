  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is focused on building core strength through variations of planks and Russian twists, which suggests a structured, technique-driven approach. The short duration (just over 10 minutes) indicates that it's likely focused and intense but concise. The absence of equipment aligns with a more minimalistic and intentional vibe, supporting 'The Zen Flow' as the workout may emphasize form and control. \n\nThe playlist includes upbeat tracks like remixes by Sofi Tukker and Major Lazer, providing energizing background music fitting for 'The Reboot Workout,' which often combines music to stimulate and refresh the participant. Additionally, the inclusion of standard on-the-mat exercises points to a repetitive, meditative quality, supporting 'The Meditative Grind,' as the body engages in continuous yet soothing effort.\n\nThe combination of these elements \u2013 a core focus, on-the-mat format, and energizing music \u2013 led to selecting these vibes with a moderate to high level of confidence. Other high-intensity vibes were excluded due to the absence of HIIT elements or advanced equipment."
