  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and involves breaking down the rowing stroke, explicitly indicating that a rowing machine is required. The description 'break down each movement of your rowing stroke with Aquil through a series of pauses' strongly suggests the necessity of this equipment. Additionally, the image provided features an individual using a rowing machine, further supporting its requirement. The workout being a 'warm-up' does not exclude the use of the rowing machine as it is central to the described activities. Therefore, the confidence level for the rowing machine is very high at 1.0."
