  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of approximately 21 minutes, and is labeled as an AMRAP (as many reps as possible), which indicates a potentially high energy expenditure depending on intensity. The moderate max rhythm (26) and the circuit nature imply a workout that is likely to be moderately demanding for beginners, but could feel somewhat challenging due to the continuous nature and lack of rest periods typical of AMRAP.",
