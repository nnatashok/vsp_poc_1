  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is over 21 minutes with an AMRAP format, which typically involves continuous exercise pushing participants to perform more rounds within a time limit. This suggests a moderate energy expenditure suitable for beginners and intermediates. The mention of the instructor's 'fast-paced, spicy style' indicates a potential for challenging intensity, giving a slight lean into a challenging effort difficulty, however, the 'for all levels' description keeps it predominantly moderate as it should accommodate beginners.",
