  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which means the Technique Difficulty can only be rated as 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate'. With a max rhythm of 28 and a format specified as 'Climb', the coordination required does not exceed an intermediate level. However, since the user fitness level requirements specify 'Intermediate', it validates a technique difficulty slightly leaning towards both Beginner and Intermediate due to basic rowing principles involved.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is 16 minutes and 30 seconds, which combined with the intensity level 2 out of 3 and category 'sweat' indicates a higher energy expenditure typical of a moderate to challenging intensity for deconditioned individuals. The '4-minute on 1-minute off' structure is somewhat demanding for those in poor physical shape, thus a weak alignment with 'Challenging' and a stronger alignment with 'Moderate' is appropriate.",
