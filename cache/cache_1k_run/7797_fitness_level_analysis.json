Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated Light (0.95) considering the workout's 'Cool Down' nature, which suggests minimal exertion. With a duration of 5:49, this is reflective of a short workout length, typical for a cooldown session intended for recovery rather than intensive activity. The 'steady', low-intensity rowing and relaxing pace of 20 strokes per minute further support a low energy expenditure. No additional physical demands are indicated.",
