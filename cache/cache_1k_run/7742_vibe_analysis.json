  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Meditative Grind' is selected as a strong match with a score of 0.8 due to the emphasis on a steady rhythm (max rhythm: 26) and the endurance-focused nature of the rowing exercise, which aligns with long-distance, repetitive workouts. The term 'climb' further suggests a meditative, enduring challenge.\n\n'The Endorphin Wave' is also applicable, with a score of 0.7, as the workout involves climbing with music that can enhance motivation and energy levels (rock playlist), indicating an elevated energy and feel-good movement. The use of upbeat classic rock songs like 'Nothin' But A Good Time' supports this classification. The description 'sweat' and 'intensity level: 2 out of 3' highlight a medium intensity suitable for an endorphin-releasing experience.\n\nAlternative vibes, such as 'The Explorer's Workout', were considered due to the outdoor setting (Lake Tahoe), but were not selected due to the lack of specific emphasis on exploration or adventure."
