  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a warm-up with a short duration of 5:40 and a steady rhythm. Warm-ups are usually designed to prepare the body, rather than to challenge it energetically, indicating very low energy expenditure characteristic of the 'Light' effort difficulty level. The warm-up's focus on 'building power and energy' hints at a potential light cardiovascular component, allowing for minimal consideration of 'Moderate', though the primary alignment is with 'Light'.",
