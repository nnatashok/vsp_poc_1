  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout was classified as 'Indoor rowing' with a high confidence score of 1.0 based on the explicit wording in the workout name 'Race Intervals Row' and the category tags that include 'row.' This indicates a strong focus on rowing activities, typically done on a rowing machine. Additionally, the term 'Interval' in the format and the description highlights a structured interval training approach, often associated with HIIT-style workouts, justifying its inclusion with a moderate score of 0.6. The workout's intensity level is noted as 2 out of 3, supporting a higher intensity classification like HIIT. The absence of explicit references to other types of workouts in the metadata makes other categories less applicable."
