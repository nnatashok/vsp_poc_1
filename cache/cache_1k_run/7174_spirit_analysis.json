  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence of 0.9. This is clearly indicated by the title 'De-Stress Restorative Yoga' and the description highlighting relaxation, calming the mind, and restoring the body. The music genres 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' further support a comforting and relaxing environment suitable for restorative yoga.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a moderate score of 0.6. The mention of the session being led from 'Seville' and the outdoor setting visible in the image suggest elements of exploration and connection with a scenic environment. This enhances the relaxation aspect through immersion in a unique setting.\n\nThe other possible spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are not relevant due to the focus on rest and relaxation, which are antithetical to intense or sport-specific workouts."
