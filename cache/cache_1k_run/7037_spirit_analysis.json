  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by its focus on stretching, indicated by the title \"Post-Row Stretch.\" This supports the Soothing & Restorative spirit, given the emphasis on recovery and relaxation through stretching hip flexors and adductors. The use of the word \"stretch\" and the context of completing this after a row suggest a recovery-oriented activity, leading to a very high score of 0.9 for Soothing & Restorative.\n\nAdditionally, the outdoor setting seen in the image, with snow and natural scenery, points to an Outdoor & Adventure element. This context adds to a mild outdoor exploration vibe, justifying a 0.6 score for Outdoor & Adventure, reflecting the gentle exploration of stretching in a natural environment. The music genre and specific songs do not heavily influence energy levels, but they maintain an ambient atmosphere suitable for stretching."
