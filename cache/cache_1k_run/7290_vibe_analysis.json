  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is categorized as high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which aligns strongly with 'The Firestarter' vibe, characterized by fast, explosive, and electrifying workouts. The description mentions 'ten sets of 1-minute high intensity intervals' and an intensity level of 3 out of 3, supporting a strong association with intense, short bursts of energy.\n\nThe presence of songs like 'The Final Countdown' and 'Good Vibrations' add an energetic and uplifting aspect, supporting 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe with its elevated energy and feel-good movement, evident in endurance rowing.\n\nThe playlist features music genres including Rock and Global Hits, which can elevate the beat-driven and euphoric atmosphere, leading to a moderate association with 'The Nightclub Workout,' especially considering the diverse and upbeat nature of the songs like 'Cupid Shuffle' and 'Soul Bossa Nova.' However, this connection is less strong compared to the primary HIIT focus.\n\nOverall confidence is high due to explicit indicators such as the format and intensity, with strong musical cues supporting the secondary vibes."
