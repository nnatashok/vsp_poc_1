  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Indoor rowing' with high confidence for several reasons. The title 'Sweet Spot Warm-Up' and description mentioning a shift between a walk and sprint pace suggest a cardio workout, possibly involving intervals. The metadata lists categories including 'standard' and 'row', directly indicating a rowing activity. While the term 'warm-up' is used, this aligns more with the preparatory nature of a workout rather than a specific category like 'Stretching' or 'Yoga'. The frequent switch between intensities and the mention of a 'sweet spot' are characteristic of rowing, which often incorporates varied paces to optimize cardiovascular benefits. Music choice indicates mid-intensity energy supporting a dynamic warm-up on a rowing machine. Despite an absence of detailed equipment description, the provided cues strongly point to indoor rowing as the core activity."
