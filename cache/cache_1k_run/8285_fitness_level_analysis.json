  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' and mention of rhythms 28 thru 32 at maximum pace suggest a mid-to-high level of complexity in technique. As per the Hydrow-specific rule, a 'drive' workout is inherently considered Advanced in technique. However, given that it's within the 'row' category, Beginner to Intermediate ratings are typically expected. But the mix of row and drive, and the need to handle high paces, align better with Intermediate to Advanced levels, despite the standard row category.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled with an intensity level of 3 out of 3, indicating its physical demand is on the higher side. The 21-minute duration with high rhythm (max 32) implies significant cardiovascular demand and energy expenditure. The playlist supports a dynamic and high-energy workout environment, reinforcing a Challenging to Extreme level of effort difficulty. This aligns with Advanced fitness requirements, where the effort needed would be rigorous for less fit users.",
