  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Race on the Thames Cool-Down' is primarily classified under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The emphasis on 'cool-down' in both the title and description suggests a focus on relaxation and recovery, aiming to 'take the pressure off your legs' after a race, which aligns with the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The use of music with slower rhythmic pacing (max rhythm of 22) and the inclusion of songs by Ed Sheeran, known for their calming melody, further support this classification. A score of 0.8 reflects a strong match to this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of a rowing session in a natural, outdoor setting mentioned in the title ('Thames') supports the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Though primarily a cool-down, the outdoor river context adds an adventurous element, earning it a secondary score of 0.7 for this spirit. This captures the environment's influence on the energy of the workout. Other spirits like High-Energy & Intense or Sport & Agility were excluded since the focus is on gentle recovery rather than athletic performance or intense physical challenge."
