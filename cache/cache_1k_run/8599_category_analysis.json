  "categoriesExplanation": "The video titled \"Commit to Fit: Staying on Track Row\" is classified primarily under 'Indoor rowing' and 'HIIT' based on several strong indicators in the metadata. The workout description mentions a \"high-intensity drive,\" suggesting a rigorous and dynamic exercise format consistent with HIIT. Furthermore, the format is explicitly stated as 'HIIT' with a maximum rhythm of 30, confirming the high-intensity interval training component. The category tags such as 'drive', 'standard', and 'row' along with the absence of any other equipment and the mentioned 'row' specifically indicate indoor rowing as a central part of the workout. The workout intensity level of 3 out of 3 further supports this classification. The high confidence levels (0.95) reflect clear and explicit evidence from the metadata supporting these categories."
