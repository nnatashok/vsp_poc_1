  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Yoga' with a high confidence score due to several explicit indicators in the metadata. The title 'Beginner Yoga Align' strongly suggests a yoga session focused on alignment, a common theme in yoga practice. Additionally, the presence of a reference to 'On The Mat' in the category section aligns with typical yoga practices, which often involve mat-based exercises. The description mentions a serene setting at the beach, which matches the calm and mindful nature associated with yoga workouts. The music played, described as Chill/low and Cool/Downtempo, complements the relaxed atmosphere typically desired in a yoga session. Other categories like 'Mat', 'Stretching', or 'Meditation' are less applicable due to the explicit mention of 'Yoga' and the lack of specific stretching or meditative focus beyond what's inherent in yoga practice. The strong presence of yoga-related keywords and context justifies the score of 0.9 for the 'Yoga' category."
