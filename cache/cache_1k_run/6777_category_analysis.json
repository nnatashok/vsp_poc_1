  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is best categorized as 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 0.8. The title 'Steady 80s Row' and the use of terms like 'steady' and 'row' in the description explicitly indicate that this is a rowing workout. The workout is performed with a rowing machine, hence the classification as Indoor rowing. The mention of maintaining a steady rhythm and 'max rhythm: 22' underscores the focus on a consistent rowing pace.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Workout Type' is described as 'breathe', correlating to 'Breathing exercises'. This suggests a focus on controlled breathing during the rowing session, thus complementing the main rowing activity. Therefore, 'Breathing exercises' is selected with a score of 0.6 to reflect its significant, though secondary, presence in the workout.\n\nThe playlist information about the 80s music helps set the workout atmosphere but does not affect the categorization significantly. The 'Workout intensity level' of 1 out of 3 indicates a low-intensity session, which aligns with rowing and breathing exercises focusing on steadiness and rhythm."
