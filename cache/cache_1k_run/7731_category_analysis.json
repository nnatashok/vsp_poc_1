  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Indoor rowing' with a high score of 0.9 based on the workout's name 'Steady State Row' and description emphasizing rowing at specific rhythms. The inclusion of the term 'row' in both the title and the metadata suggests a strong focus on rowing, central to the workout experience. The intensity level of 1 out of 3 indicates a low-intensity session, characteristic of steady-state cardio rowing rather than a high-intensity session. Additionally, 'breathe' is mentioned in both the type and category, indicating an emphasis on breathing, which is typical in exercises focusing on breathing techniques. Therefore, 'Breathing exercises' is also a relevant category with a score of 0.7, reflecting its importance but secondary nature compared to rowing itself. The playlist with upbeat, popular songs may support maintaining a steady rhythm but doesn\u2019t directly point towards a more intense workout type like HIIT or Mat exercises. Thus, these categories were not considered applicable."
