  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for this workout is classified primarily as Beginner due to the core categorization as a 'row' workout, which suggests a limited range of movement complexity. Rowing basics, particularly with a pyramid format, usually involve basic rowing strokes, aligning with the lower end of the technique spectrum. However, as the max rhythm is 26, which indicates a moderately increased stroke rate, a small alignment with Intermediate is considered.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is primarily classified as Light due to the 'breathe' workout type and the low intensity rating of 1 out of 3, suggesting low energy demands. The 21-minute duration and the consistent pacing align with a gentle approach meant to maintain a steady rhythm without intensity peaks. Some aspects, such as the double pyramid format and moderate rhythm, slightly push towards Moderate, albeit not significantly.",
