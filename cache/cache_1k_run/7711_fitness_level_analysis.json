  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'row' and 'drive' type, which inherently aligns with a technique difficulty level of Beginner to Intermediate. Given that this session is a 'Drive' workout on Hydrow, it is characterized by a more advanced level of rhythm and coordination, hence Intermediate technique difficulty is strongly indicated. Despite this, rowing fundamentally remains a movement accessible at the Beginner level, resulting in moderate alignment there as well.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves 45-second high-intensity intervals with a maximum rhythm of 34, which indicates a high cardiovascular and muscular demand. The description specifies 'maximum effort,' and the intensity rating is 3 out of 3, suggesting a very demanding pace throughout the 21-minute duration. Although the duration is relatively short for Extreme classification, the high perceived exertion from the Drive format supports a Challenging to somewhat Extreme effort level.",
