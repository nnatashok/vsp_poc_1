  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled \"Power Pyramid Row\" and described with keywords like \"rowing on the Charles River\" and \"Pyramid\" format strongly indicate an Indoor rowing category. The explicit mention of 'rowing' as a primary activity, alongside the structured intensity levels commonly associated with rowing workouts, supports this classification. The intensity level '2 out of 3' and the focus on rhythm are typical of rowing exercises aimed at providing cardiovascular benefits while maintaining moderate intensity. The music playlist, highlighting popular and upbeat songs, aligns with keeping momentum during a rhythmic workout like rowing. Since other categories like HIIT, Mat, or Elliptical were not indicated by the metadata details, they were excluded from consideration. The confidence level is very high due to the clear indicators provided in the metadata."
