  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Steady Progression Row' has elements indicating a 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, such as the focus on technique and steady rowing at 20-24 spm, aligning with the repetitive and endurance aspects typically associated with this vibe. The intensity level of 1 out of 3 further supports its meditative nature, and the use of the term 'breathe' along with the focus on 'technique' suggests a calm, focused workout style. The music genres, Indie Alternative and Global Hits, do not explicitly point towards a high-energy vibe but can complement the steady, rhythmic rowing.\n\nThe 'Endorphin Wave' vibe is also present but to a lesser extent, given the steady build and feel-good music in the playlist, reflecting an elevated but controlled energy level throughout. The mix of songs from artists like Hozier and Fleetwood Mac adds an uplifting, enjoyable element that fits with this vibe, contributing to the rhythm and emotional upliftment of the session. However, due to the lower intensity and focus on steady progression, the confidence for this vibe is moderate."
