  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 16 minutes and music genres indicating a low-energy flow, the effort difficulty appears to be mainly light. Yoga sessions are generally low intensity, especially when described as chest openings. The presence of more laid-back music genres reinforces a light workout experience. Moderate (0.2) applies due to potentially maintaining poses, but the primary energy expenditure is Light (0.8).",
