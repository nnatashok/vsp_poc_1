  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Shift to Sprint Row' workout has a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, indicated by the rowing being performed on a river, as seen in the image, and the outdoor setting. This contributes to high confidence (score 0.9) in this classification. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present due to the emphasis on shifting in rhythm and focusing until the end of each interval, supported by the dynamic playlist that includes songs like \"Run Away With Me.\" This aligns well with coordinated and music-driven pacing, warranting a score of 0.7. Additionally, the workout features intermittent intensity (interval format) and is part of the 'Sweat' category, drawing a connection to a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, though at a moderate intensity (2 out of 3), suggesting a less intense but still vigorous session. This results in a score of 0.6. Other spirits were not marked due to lack of alignment with the session's structured rhythmic focus and setting."
