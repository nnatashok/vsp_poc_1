Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as a 'cool down', which inherently involves gentle, low-intensity activities intended for relaxation and recovery. The duration of just under 6 minutes with a steady rhythm and lack of high-intensity cues suggests minimal physical exertion. This, combined with a 20 max rhythm, supports the classification as Light effort difficulty, indicating a very low energy expenditure suitable for users with minimal fitness levels.",
