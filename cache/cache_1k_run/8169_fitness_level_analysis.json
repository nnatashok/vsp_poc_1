Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is just under 6 minutes and is a part of the 'cool down' category, which inherently suggests a low intensity and is mainly for helping the body transition from higher activity levels to rest. There is no indication of vigorous exercise, and the steady rhythm implies a consistent but calm pace. All these factors strongly suggest a Light level of effort difficulty, supported by the short duration and purpose of the session.",
