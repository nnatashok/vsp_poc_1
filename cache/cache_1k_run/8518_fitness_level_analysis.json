  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The circuit format is designed to keep the participant moving, with minimal rest, throughout a nearly 21-minute session. The 'AMRAP' (as many rounds as possible) aspect intensifies the energy demand depending on personal pace. The mention of a quick tempo by the instructor further implies an elevated energy expenditure suitable for moderately conditioned individuals and challenging for complete beginners. This combination suggests a moderately demanding workout with elements that could be considered challenging depending on individuals' pacing and selection of dumbbell weight.",
