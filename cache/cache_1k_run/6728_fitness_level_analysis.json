  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercise type being 'row' sets a boundary for technique difficulty, allowing only Beginner or Intermediate. Given the inclusion of 'Drive' in the workout type, it directly implies an Intermediate level of technique difficulty, aligning with rowing actions that require some skill and practice to perform effectively.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a high intensity level rated 3 out of 3 and a format tagged 'Power', both indicators of significant energy demands and high physical exertion, reinforcing a Challenging effort difficulty. The expectation to push for personal bests and climbing intervals increase intensity further. Thus, Challenging is strongly aligned with the possibility of Extreme for very deconditioned individuals.",
