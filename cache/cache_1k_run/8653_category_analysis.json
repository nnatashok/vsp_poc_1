  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Steady Cool-Down\" and is associated with low rhythms, indicating a relaxed pace intended for recovery post-exercise. The categorization includes 'row', suggesting that an indoor rowing machine is likely involved, despite being a cool-down session. This aligns with the steady format which typically involves consistent, relaxed rowing activity without intervals or intense stress, warranting a classification under \"Indoor rowing\" with a score of 0.7.\n\nThe presence of \"Cool Down\" indicates the session includes elements of gentle stretching or low-intensity movement, and the relaxed nature of the music (Chill low, Cool/Downtempo) supports this. Hence, \"Stretching\" is assigned a score of 0.3 as a secondary category. The categories confidence of 0.65 reflects strong indications of rowing with some overlap into cool-down techniques commonly used for stretching or light movements in cool-down phases."
