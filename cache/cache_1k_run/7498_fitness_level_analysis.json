  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', aligning with Beginner to Intermediate technique difficulty due to the inherent nature of rowing exercises. The workout features steady rhythms at a max rhythm of 24, which suggests relatively simple movements. Thus, it strongly aligns with a Beginner level due to its straightforward execution, but there is a slight alignment with Intermediate due to structured intervals, justifying a minor score for the Intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout aims to build an aerobic base through 3-minute intervals at low rhythms. With an intensity level set at 1 out of 3 and a moderate duration of 21:16, it demands minimal to moderate effort, primarily due to its low intensity and steady format. It aligns strongly with a Light effort level, suitable for deconditioned users, but also shows moderate alignment with Moderate effort due to interval training, which could challenge beginners slightly. Overall, there is a significant emphasis on low-intensity aerobic work.",
