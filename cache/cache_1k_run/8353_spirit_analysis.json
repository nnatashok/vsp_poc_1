  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a high confidence score of 0.9 because it is performed on a river as indicated by the provided image, and involves exploring Prague through legends and myths. This environment and thematic storytelling align strongly with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. \n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is also relevant with a score of 0.7, as the workout is a HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) session, which includes a high rhythm (max rhythm 30) and is rated intensity level 3 out of 3. Additionally, the use of high-energy music from dance and global hits genres supports this classification.\n\nThe absence of an instructor and the focus on historic narratives may exclude 'Structured & Disciplined'. 'Flow & Rhythm', 'Soothing & Restorative', and 'Sport & Agility' are not as applicable due to the nature of the workout and environmental setting."
