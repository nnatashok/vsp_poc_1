  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is identified as a rowing session under the 'row' category. According to Hydrow's specific rules, technique difficulty for rowing workouts can only be Beginner or Intermediate. The inclusion of HIIT format suggests some level of coordination and rhythm adaptation, especially given the max rhythm of 28, hence Intermediate is apt. Confidence is very high due to metadata alignment and 'row' category constraints.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves 30 and 60-second intervals labeled as HIIT and is classified under 'sweat' and 'standard', indicating vigorous activity that could be demanding for less fit users. The duration of 11 minutes suggests a high-intensity, short workout, typical for HIIT, but less exhausting due to its limited time length. With an intensity level of 2 out of 3, it's reasonable to classify this as Moderate to Challenging for deconditioned users. Confidence is high based on intensity cues and HIIT structure.",
