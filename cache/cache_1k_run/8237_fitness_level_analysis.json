  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is 21 minutes for a yoga flow focused on hip opening, which is not highly exertive. Yoga inherently involves holding poses that can raise heart rate but typically remains low intensity. Therefore, Light is scored strongly at 0.7. Given the flow duration, Moderate is given some consideration with a score of 0.4 as the workout could present some physical challenge to unfit users.",
