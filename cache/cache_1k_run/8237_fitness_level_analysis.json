  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is 21 minutes and 21 seconds, which is relatively short for a flow-based workout, suggesting a lower intensity and energy expenditure. The music genre hints at a relaxed or downtempo vibe, implying pace is not rapid or highly vigorous. Although flows can involve continuous movement, without aggressive intensity cues or high-intensity elements mentioned, effort likely remains light. Considering the length and relaxed style, this workout is best suited to Light effort, with a moderate alignment suggesting some variability contingent on personal intensity. Overall, energy demands are low, suitable for users with less advanced fitness.",
