  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Indoor rowing' due to several strong indicators in the metadata. The term 'March Race' suggests a competitive, timed workout typical for rowing activities. The description mentions 'race to accumulate maximum meters,' which aligns with rowing exercises focused on distance and performance. The 'Max rhythm: 32' and 'Format: Power' further suggest a structured rowing workout format. Additionally, the tags 'drive, standard, row' imply this is a rowing session. The absence of explicit mention of a rowing machine is the only source of minor ambiguity, but all other evidence strongly points to this being an Indoor rowing workout, thus warranting a high score of 0.9."
