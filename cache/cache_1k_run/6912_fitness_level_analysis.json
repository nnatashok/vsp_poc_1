  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a cool-down session lasting under 6 minutes, at a 'steady' format with a maximum rhythm of 20 strokes per minute, emphasizing low effort. This low-intensity, short-duration session aligns almost entirely with the Light effort level, supported by its purpose to cool down the body rather than exert it. The absence of high intensity or volume further corroborates the Light classification confidently at 0.9.",
