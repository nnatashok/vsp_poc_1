  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Power Intervals Row' is characterized by interval training ('90\" and 60\" intervals') aimed at building power and endurance, indicating a strong 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The 'sweat' category further supports an energetic and intensive approach. The music playlist, featuring energetic tracks like 'Break Your Heart' and 'Holidae In', suggests an engaging and active workout environment, contributing to this spirit with a score of 0.7.\n\nAdditionally, the visual indicates the workout is done outdoors on water, strongly supporting the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Being recorded on a river, this element is a defining aspect, giving it a high score of 0.9.\n\nThere is a minor presence of 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the rhythmic nature of rowing, especially as music with beat-driven indie and global hits is played, leading to a cohesive movement experience. However, this is less pronounced, so it scores 0.4.\n\nThe interval structure and the outdoor setting exclude other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Structured & Disciplined', which require more different formats or environments."
