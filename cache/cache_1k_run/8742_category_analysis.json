  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Indoor rowing', as evidenced by the title 'Light Effort Row' and the mention of 'steady' and 'row' in the category descriptor. These explicitly indicate the use of a rowing machine, therefore scoring 0.85 due to strong markers of rowing activity. Additionally, the description emphasizes 'low rhythms and light effort,' typical of a rowing workout focused on endurance rather than intensity. \n\nA secondary category is 'Breathing exercises', reflected by the 'Workout Type: breathe' tag, indicating an incorporation of focused breathing techniques, which aligns with the light effort and rhythm. This presence is moderately strong, scoring 0.65. The title and metadata suggest an attempt to incorporate breathing elements, though rowing remains the core activity. \n\nDespite the low intensity level (1 out of 3), the structured intervals and music choice do not correspond with 'Stretching' or 'Yoga', as these typically have different goals and lacks explicit evidence here."
