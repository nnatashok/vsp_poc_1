  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is based on the category 'row' and focuses on 2-minute intervals, which aligns closely with Beginner to Intermediate technique difficulty levels. The rowing aspect inherently limits the Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate as per the rowing category rules. There is no indication of requiring advanced rowing skills or technical complexity such as complex movement patterns or coordination challenges beyond typical rowing motion.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 11 minutes and 20 seconds with 2-minute high-intensity intervals suggests a Moderate energy output, with alignment to the 'sweat' workout type indicating a higher intensity focus. The description, 'turn up the volume and intensity,' hints towards a more engaging and concerted effort, suitable for a Moderate to Challenging classification, particularly given the music genre aimed at increasing excitement and engagement.",
