  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Instructional: Master the Catch' is focused on learning technique, as indicated by the words 'instructional' and 'technique' in the metadata. This focus on teaching and precision aligns strongly with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, evidenced by the detailed explanation of body positioning at the catch. The metadata includes terms like 'warm-up' and 'standard', which suggest a methodical and structured approach, supporting this categorization with a high confidence score of 0.85.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of music genres like Soul/Funk/Disco/Motown may introduce elements of rhythm and flow into the session. Hence, a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is assigned with a moderate score of 0.5, considering the potential influence of rhythmic music on the workout pacing, though it is less dominant than the structured aspect. Other spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Outdoor & Adventure', are not applicable due to the session's technique-focused and indoor setting."
