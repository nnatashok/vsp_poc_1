  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Indoor rowing' with a high score of 0.9, as the title 'Weekly Stories Row' and the description explicitly mention rowing as the central activity. Additionally, the playlist of rock and metal music supports an energetic rowing session. The format being 'Interval' suggests the presence of varied pace or resistance periods, characteristic of 'HIIT', leading to its inclusion with a score of 0.7. The workout intensity level of 2 out of 3 and the rocking music further indicate a vigorous and potentially high-intensity interval workout. Other categories like 'Mat' or 'Body weight' were excluded due to the specific mention of rowing equipment and activity, with no focus on floor exercises or non-equipment-based training in the metadata."
