Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is short (just under 6 minutes), indicating lower overall energy expenditure, thus aligned with a 'Light' effort difficulty. Additionally, Pilates can require sustained muscle activation and slight intensity as glute isolation is mentioned, suggesting a 'Moderate' level also applies, though less strongly. Thus, scores of 0.85 for Light and 0.6 for Moderate reflect the alignment with perceived difficulty and energy expenditure emulating a short focused session.",
