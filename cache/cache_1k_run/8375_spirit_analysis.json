  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit identified is 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.9. The clear mention of rowing in Alaska, coupled with the open-water setting in the image, strongly supports this classification.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant, scoring 0.7, due to the emphasis on 'climbing in rhythm' and a playlist that features energetic pop music, which suggests a coordinated pacing and mind-body connection.\n\nFinally, 'High-Energy & Intense' is a reasonable match, given the 'sweat' category, the format of 3- to 4-minute climbing intervals, and the playlist that encourages a vigorous workout, justifying a score of 0.5.\n\nThe workout name and metadata provide little evidence for 'Soothing & Restorative', 'Structured & Disciplined', or 'Sport & Agility', thus they were not selected as prominent spirits."
