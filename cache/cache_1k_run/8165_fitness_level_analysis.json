  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which inherently restricts its Technique Difficulty to 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate'. The movement involved in rowing focuses mostly on a repeating, controlled stroke which is not complex. However, as the user fitness level requirement is 'Intermediate', we can infer that proper technique involves a moderate understanding of the form, aligning it more with Intermediate.",

The intensity level is marked 2 out of 3, suggesting it is somewhat demanding, but not extremely so. The rhythm maxing out at 28 also adds a moderate challenge due to its higher pace. Music choice ('Pop mid, Global Hits') likely offers an energetic atmosphere enhancing perceived effort. These factors contribute to a Moderate to potentially Challenging effort for a less-fit user.",
