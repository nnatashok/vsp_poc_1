  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Back Bends Align' with a description mentioning warming up for backbends suggests a focus on flexibility and controlled movements, often associated with Yoga. This inference is strengthened by key metadata such as the Workout Type 'align' and Category tags 'on-the-mat' which indicate mat-based exercises typical in Yoga sessions. No equipment is needed, aligning with bodyweight and posture-focused practices. The musical playlist features chill and downtempo genres, supporting a calm atmosphere conducive to Yoga or Stretching. Stretching is also considered due to the emphasis on backbends and warmups, common in flexibility training. The scores reflect a high likelihood of Yoga as a central component (0.75) and moderate evidence for Stretching (0.6) based on the metadata, but less than for Yoga due to the stronger indicators towards a structured practice, characteristic of Yoga."
