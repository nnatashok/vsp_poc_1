  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'Drive', which Hydrow defines as inherently Advanced due to its emphasis on power and technical proficiency in rowing. 'Drive' signifies a requirement for maintaining high intensity with effective technique across short durations, a characteristic of advanced technique difficulty. The format 'Power' indicates focus on strength, difficult for lower skill users. Additionally, the need to synchronize at a max rhythm of 32+ requires some rowing expertise, reinforcing the Advanced classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, despite its short duration of 1 minute and 50 seconds, is high intensity, as indicated by the maximum rhythm of 32+ SPM and 'Power' format, aiming for maximum meters in a short time. These elements elevate physical demand to Challenging, appropriate for significant but not extreme energy expenditure. The intensity level 3/3 suggests energy expenditure beyond moderate levels but doesn't extend duration enough for an 'Extreme' classification.",
