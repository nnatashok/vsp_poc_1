  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary evidence indicating the classification of this workout as 'Pilates' comes from the explicit mention of 'Pilates' in the workout name and description. The description states that it is an 'intermediate pilates workout' intended to move and strengthen the body, which reinforces this category. The tags and category also explicitly list 'On The Mat', usually associated with Pilates or mat workouts. No other categories such as Yoga or Stretching were chosen, as the metadata specifically emphasizes Pilates without mentioning flexibility or mindfulness aspects. The overall confidence in the category assignment is very high at 0.95 due to the strong indicators throughout the metadata, focusing on Pilates as the core activity. The absence of specific equipment aligns with typical Pilates workouts, further supporting the classification."
