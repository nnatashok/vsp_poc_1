  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly focused on rowing, as indicated by the title 'Commit to Your Split Row' and the mention of \"sets of 10-stroke builders\" in the description, clearly pointing to 'Indoor rowing.' The interval format, max rhythm of 32, and intensity level of 3 out of 3 suggest a high-intensity workout, aligning with the characteristics of 'HIIT.' The use of music genres like Pop and Global Hits complements intense workout routines typically found in HIIT sessions. The lack of an instructor and specific equipment further supports these categories, as they are common in guided rowing and interval workouts. The scores reflect high confidence in these categories, with 'Indoor rowing' as the primary focus and HIIT as a complementary aspect of the workout."
