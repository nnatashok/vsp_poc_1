  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Mat' with a high score of 0.9. The title 'Hip Mobility' and the description indicate exercises designed to open up hips and the lower body, which can involve a range of floor-based movements typical for mat workouts. The mention of 'On The Mat' further supports this classification. 'Stretching' is also relevant with a score of 0.65, as mobility exercises often incorporate stretching to improve flexibility and range of motion. The description of 'Open up your hips and lower body' aligns with stretching exercises. Lastly, 'Body weight' is assigned a lower score of 0.4, as the exercises likely involve movements using only the participant's weight, especially since a foam roller is the only recommended piece of equipment, suggesting minimal additional load. Other categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Pilates' were excluded due to lack of specific language or elements related to those practices in the metadata."
