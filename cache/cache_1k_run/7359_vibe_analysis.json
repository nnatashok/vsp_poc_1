  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Steady State Row' centers on maintaining a steady rhythm at a moderate pace (22 and 24 strokes per minute), which strongly aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The focus on breathing and steady-state rowing supports a rhythmic, repetitive, and meditative quality, justifying the high score of 0.75. The rock playlist, including tracks like 'Up Around The Bend' and 'Reelin' In The Years,' adds an element of enjoyment and endurance, contributing to the 'The Endorphin Wave,' which suggests an elevated, feel-good energy, thus a score of 0.6. The workout's low intensity and calm pacing ruled out more intense vibes. The music aides in sustaining motivation but doesn't imply high tempo or explosive qualities, hence excluding more dynamic vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.'"
