  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is strongly characterized by the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to its description of 'high-intensity intervals' and a workout intensity level of '3 out of 3'. Additionally, the use of rock music, known for its energizing effect, supports this categorization, earning it a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also present due to the setting, as shown in the image with the rowing taking place on a river, aligning with the adventurous, nature-based elements. This is given a score of 0.7.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is moderately represented through high-intensity rock music that emphasizes rhythm and continuity, supporting a mind-body connection during the workout, though this is less prominent and is scored at 0.5.\n\nOther spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined', 'Soothing & Restorative', and 'Sport & Agility' were not considered significant due to the lack of specific technical focus, relaxation elements, or sport-specific skills in the metadata."
