  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Drive' which on Hydrow suggests advanced movement execution. However, since the activity is rowing-based, the technique difficulty is limited to Beginner or Intermediate. The HIIT format with a max rhythm of 34 indicates high intensity, but rowing itself is relatively straightforward to learn, suggesting an Intermediate technique difficulty with about 80% alignment.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is fairly short at 11 minutes 21 seconds, but the high-intensity level (3/3) and the HIIT format, coupled with 'fast-paced' and 'give it all you've got' cues, suggest significant energy expenditure over a short time. The effort difficulty aligns well with Challenging, scoring 70%.",
