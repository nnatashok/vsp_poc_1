  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Core Strength' and is described as a strength workout intended to strengthen the core. This characteristically aligns with bodyweight exercises that focus on core stability and muscular endurance. Additionally, the description specifies the workout is performed 'On The Mat', indicating exercises typically performed on the floor without added equipment, which supports the classification as a 'Mat' workout. The absence of specified equipment, combined with a duration suitable for focused core exercises, reinforces that the workout fits the 'Body weight' category. The playlist of energetic music suggests a standard exercise routine rather than a relaxing session, further ruling out categories like 'Yoga' or 'Stretching'. The confidence is high at 0.85 due to the clear description and categorization provided."
