  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under \"The Reboot Workout\" with a score of 0.8. The focus on a 'cool down' and emphasis on 'sequencing' and technique suggests a lower intensity, calming workout that aids in recovery, aligning with a reboot vibe. The music genre includes 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits', which could suggest a lighter, refreshing atmosphere, further supporting this vibe. \"The Zen Flow\" is assigned a score of 0.6 because of the grounding and intentional focus on body mechanics, indicative of a breath-centered, routine flow. \"The Masterclass Workout\" is considered with a score of 0.5 owing to the technique emphasis, as refinement and skill-building are central to mastering movements. Although upbeat songs like 'Best Day Of My Life' may infuse some energy, the overall focus remains on technique and cooldown."
