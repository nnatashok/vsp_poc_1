  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 16-minute duration coupled with the 'gentle flow' and chill music indicates low energy expenditure. This aligns strongly with 'Light' effort difficulty. However, there might be a slight increase in intensity during flow elements, suggesting a weak alignment with 'Moderate' effort difficulty.",
