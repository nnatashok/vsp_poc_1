  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Indoor rowing' with a high score of 0.9. This categorization is strongly supported by the workout name 'Climbing Intervals Row' and metadata keywords such as 'row' and 'rower', indicating usage of a rowing machine. The structured format, 'four sets of 4-minute intervals,' and the indication of 'climb in rhythm' suggest interval training, aligning it also with 'HIIT'. The descriptor 'Interval' specifies a period of alternating exercise intensity, typical of HIIT workouts, which justifies its inclusion with a score of 0.7. The 'Workout intensity level' of 2 out of 3 indicates a moderate to high intensity, supporting the presence of interval training. The music playlist featuring upbeat and rhythmic tracks from 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' genres reinforces the energetic atmosphere common in HIIT and rowing sessions. Other categories, such as 'Mat', 'Running', or 'Stretching', are excluded due to the lack of applicable exercises or equipment involved."
