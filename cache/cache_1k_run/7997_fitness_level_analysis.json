  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive', which is categorized by Hydrow as inherently Advanced, but for Technique Difficulty, row-based workouts generally range from Beginner to Intermediate due to the relatively straightforward nature of rowing movements. Given that this is a rowing workout with added complexity from the 'drive' category, there is a slight inclination towards Intermediate, but Beginner is more applicable due to the fundamental rowing technique involved.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is formatted as HIIT with a maximum rhythm of 32, indicating a high intensity. Also, the duration of over 21 minutes combined with the format suggest a high energy expenditure. Additionally, the workout intensity is marked as 3 out of 3, reinforcing that it is physically demanding. This classification is consistent with a 'Challenging' level, especially since users in poor shape would find this particularly difficult.",
