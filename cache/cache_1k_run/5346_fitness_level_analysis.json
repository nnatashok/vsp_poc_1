Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is 10 minutes long, indicating a relatively short duration and likely not extremely intense. However, the use of 'Feel the burn' suggests some effort required, fitting a Light (score: 0.4) to Moderate (score: 0.6) effort difficulty. The focus is on core strength, which can be physically demanding if reps or holds are extended, but the short duration indicates it remains within moderate limits.",
