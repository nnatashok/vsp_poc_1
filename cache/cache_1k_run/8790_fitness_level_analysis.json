Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 5 minutes signals low overall energy expenditure typical of a 'Light' effort session. Pilates focuses on muscle activation rather than intense cardio, aligning well with a 'Light' classification. The focus on core engagement may introduce slight additional challenge for deconditioned users, justifying a minimal score in 'Moderate'. The hip-hop and R&B music selection may increase perceived intensity but doesn't change energy demands.",
