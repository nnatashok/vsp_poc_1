Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Core Burn Express Pilates' is only 5 minutes and 37 seconds long, which limits the intensity and energy expenditure even if the exercises are focused on the core. The 'Express' tag suggests a quick, possibly higher effort session, but the short duration and typical description imply this is relatively low in intensity. Therefore, it aligns more with Light to Moderate effort, with scores of 0.75 for Light due to the brief session and 0.55 for Moderate considering possible intensity in a short period.",
