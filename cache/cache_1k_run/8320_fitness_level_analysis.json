  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The Technique Difficulty of this workout should primarily be categorized as 'Beginner' given the rowing workout type, which typically involves simple repetitive movement patterns that are easy to perform once basic form is learned. However, slight consideration for 'Intermediate' is warranted due to the inclusion of interval training and the workout's categorization as 'drive,' potentially requiring more coordination and control, thus giving a score of 0.4 for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The Effort Difficulty is categorized as 'Challenging' because this workout involves high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with a max rhythm of 32, which suggests significant exertion over the 11-minute duration. However, due to the workout's 'drive' type classification and max intensity level of 3 out of 3, there is also a strong case for it being 'Extreme,' indicating very high energy space demand, thus scored at 0.5 for Extreme.",
