  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically does not exceed an Intermediate technique difficulty level. The workout involves climbing in rhythm, which adds some complexity but remains within the realm of Beginner to Intermediate. The use of a rowing machine inherently limits complexity, aligning well with the requirement of 'Intermediate'. Hence, there's a stronger alignment with Beginner, while some aspects hint at Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Sweat' category indicates an elevated effort level, supported by a workout intensity level of 2 out of 3. The 4-minute intervals at a max rhythm of 28 strokes per minute suggest a physically demanding session, adequate for a 'Challenging' effort level. However, at just over 11 minutes in duration, the overall energy expenditure might not be extreme, suggesting a moderate-to-challenging classification.",
