  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row' within the standard category, which restricts the technique difficulty to at most Intermediate. The format 'climb,' which involves managing rhythm and intensity, suggests some level of coordination, but not beyond Intermediate. However, the exercises predominantly focus on rowing, generally fitting a Beginner to Intermediate technique difficulty. The workout requires rhythm adjustment, aligning with the Intermediate level, though the base rowing technique remains Beginner-level complex.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The Effort Difficulty is influenced by the workout's duration (11:16 minutes) and the intensity level of 2 out of 3. The 4-minute interval structure, combined with a max rhythm of 28, suggests a focus on maintaining moderate intensity throughout, aligning with a Moderate effort difficulty. The 'sweat' type indicates a higher energy expenditure than 'light' but shouldn't be extremely challenging for deconditioned users, supporting a Moderate level with strong confidence.",
