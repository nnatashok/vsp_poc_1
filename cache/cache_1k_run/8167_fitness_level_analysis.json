  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout type is 'row', the technique difficulty is likely to be either Beginner or Intermediate, based on standard rowing techniques. The Beginner score of 0.9 reflects the straightforward nature of rowing strokes that require minimal coordination, especially since the workout is categorized under 'breathe', indicating a focus on rhythm and relaxation rather than technical complexity. Intermediate is assigned a lower score (0.5) as the rowing can still involve some coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 21 minutes and 26 seconds, which is not overly long, suggesting a manageably paced session. The music genre played is energetic which matches the 'breathe' category, but the workout's intensity is marked as 1 out of 3, indicating a low-impact session. Thus, the Light rating of 0.75 is given due to the low overall intensity, and Moderate is possible but lower at 0.6 due to the potential for sustained rowing effort.",
