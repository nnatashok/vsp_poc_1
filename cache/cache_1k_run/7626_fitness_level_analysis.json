  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 5:43 minutes, coupled with its classification as a 'warm-up', suggests minimal energy expenditure. The focus on rhythm without intense intervals or high-volume sets aligns with a Light effort difficulty suitable for beginners. The climb format, while building speed, remains within a warm-up context designed to prepare rather than exhaust, leading to high confidence in a Light effort rating.",
