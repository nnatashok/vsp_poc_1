  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'Drive' rowing session, which, according to Hydrow's specific rules, suggests an Advanced level of technique difficulty. The description emphasizes 'in-depth technical detail' and 'expert technical instruction' by a Paralympic-level instructor, further justifying a higher technique rating at the Advanced level. However, given that rowing generally involves repetitive, full-body motions that aren't exceptionally complex, an Intermediate rating also applies but is less fitting based on this context.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session with an intensity level marked at the highest setting (3 out of 3). The intense rhythm (max rhythm: 34) and short intervals (45 seconds) are indicative of a demanding workout routine. Additionally, the 16-minute duration suggests a concentrated effort with minimal rest, aligning with Challenging and possibly Extreme effort difficulty for less fit users.",
