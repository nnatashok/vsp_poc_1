  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive', associated with Hydrow-specific rules requiring higher technique skills than standard rowing. Normally, rowing workouts fall into Beginner or Intermediate levels; however, the combination of the high rhythm of 34 and the interval-based HIIT format indicates a higher technical demand on coordination and form. This suggests Intermediate to Advanced technique difficulty, with a stronger fit for Intermediate due to the 'row' category.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The HIIT format paired with a max rhythm of 34 in a 'drive' workout type suggests a high energy expenditure, especially during 45-second intervals. The 16-minute duration suggests a shorter but intense session, consistent with a Challenging level. The intensity level 3 out of 3 strengthens this assessment, adding some alignment with an Extreme level, although the duration slightly moderates this.",
