  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a rowing session with interval training, which generally aligns with Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty in a rowing context. The description does not mention any complex movements, suggesting minimal coordination beyond standard rowing form, which fits the Beginner level. However, the term 'intervals' implies a need for rhythm and pacing control, nudging it slightly towards Intermediate. The intermediate mention in the User Fitness Level Requirements reinforces the presence of some coordination complexity, but not beyond Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is just over 21 minutes with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicating a moderate to challenging physical demand. The format includes '4-minute intervals' and a max rhythm of 30, suggesting bursts of effort followed by potential rest phases, typical in interval workouts which are more demanding than light activities, fitting a Moderate to Challenging effort level. The combination of these factors suggests significant energy expenditure, sufficient for a user with some fitness background but approachable for intermediate users.",
