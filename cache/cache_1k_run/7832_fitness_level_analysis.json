Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 21 minutes and the 'flow' nature suggest a balanced energy expenditure, more focused on movement fluidity and stretching. The playlist genre indicates a calm, steady pace, further implying low-intensity activity. Hence, the effort difficulty aligns strongly with Light, suitable for beginners. The inclusion of Moderate reflects the potential challenge for less fit users unfamiliar with sustaining continuous movement, albeit gently.",
