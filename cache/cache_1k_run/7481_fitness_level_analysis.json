  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves steady rowing at rhythms of 22 and 26, which are basic rowing movements. Given that rowing is the primary focus and is classified under categories like 'breathe, standard, row', this aligns strongly with a Beginner technique difficulty. The move from a rhythm of 22 to 26 may require slight coordination, justifying a minimal score for Intermediate but it's primarily a beginner exercise.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short, at just over 11 minutes, and falls under a 'breathe' category with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, suggesting a low physical demand. The rhythm increases slightly but remains low-impact, suitable for deconditioned users, primarily fitting a Light effort level with a slight lean into Moderate due to rhythm pacing.",
