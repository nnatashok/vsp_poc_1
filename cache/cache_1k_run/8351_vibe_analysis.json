  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is best described with 'The Firestarter' vibe due to the emphasis on 'high intensity intervals' and a duration of 21 minutes, suggesting a short and explosive format consistent with this vibe. The choice of music from energetic pop and global hits also supports this classification, enhancing the electrifying experience. 'The Competitor' vibe is also relevant, given the focus on rhythm and the high intensity level, which likely creates a competitive, leaderboard-driven energy typical of HIIT and rowing workouts. Finally, 'The Meditative Grind' is considered with a lower score as the rowing element and repetitive nature hint at an aspect of endurance and zone focus, albeit less prominent in this context. Overall, the high intensity and music-driven format heavily influence the vibe classification, making the primary vibe 'The Firestarter.'"
