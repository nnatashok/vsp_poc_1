  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a short duration of just over 10 minutes, limiting the overall intensity and energy output, aligning with a Light to Moderate effort level. The circuit style may involve continuous movement but given the non-intense music and moderately paced rhythm, a high energy expenditure like in Challenging levels is unlikely. Short length and circuit type support moderate exertion, allowing it to fit those with limited endurance.",
