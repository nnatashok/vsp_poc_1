  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Finding Balance Row' workout embodies a blend of 'Flow & Rhythm,' 'Outdoor & Adventure,' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits. The focus on 'balancing life on and off the water' and 'steady 6-minute pieces' suggests a rhythmic and flowing experience, aligning well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.7). The outdoor setting on the water strongly supports the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, with the visual confirming the natural environment, meriting a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe workout type 'breathe' and the low intensity level (1 out of 3) contribute to a 'Soothing & Restorative' classification, emphasizing relaxation and gentle exercise, scoring 0.6 in this category. The playlist of acoustic and mellow pop tracks suggests a calming and pleasant auditory backdrop, enhancing the restorative aspect.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the lack of high intensity and strict structure cues. Overall, the outdoor setting and gentle pace predominately define the workout's spirit."
