  "categoriesExplanation": "The title 'Post-Row Yoga Restore' and description explicitly indicate that the main focus of the workout is yoga, particularly for recovery and relaxation purposes. The words 'soothing,' 'Yoga Restore session,' and 'gentle stretches and restorative poses' strongly suggest Yoga as the primary activity. Hence, Yoga is given a high score of 0.9. Additionally, the emphasis on 'gentle stretches' and 'restorative poses' aligns with activities typical of Stretching, justifying its inclusion with a score of 0.7. This is further supported by the 'On The Mat' tag, indicating a mat-based activity. The lack of intense physical activity excludes categories like HIIT or Body weight. The overall high confidence level of 0.85 is due to the explicit mention of post-row recovery and yoga-based exercises."
