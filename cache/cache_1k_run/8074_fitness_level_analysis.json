  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, classified under the 'row' category, follows a pyramid structure which involves increasing intensity and rhythm. While generally rowing is beginner-friendly, the pyramid format introduces a level of complexity as users must adjust to changing intensities, making it suitable for those at an intermediate skill level. The requirement for rhythm adds a coordination element but remains accessible to beginners due to the nature of rowing.",
