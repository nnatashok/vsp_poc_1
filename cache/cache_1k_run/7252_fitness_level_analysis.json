  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'row' and 'drive' categories, which Hydrow rules dictate can only be Beginner or Intermediate for technique difficulty. 'Drive' workouts generally imply a focus on rhythm and intensity rather than complex movements, aligning with an Intermediate level. This is supported by the description mentioning rhythm shifts and max-effort intervals, suggesting the need for some coordination and body awareness, thus aligning with Intermediate technique.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features max-effort intervals and is categorized under 'drive' with an intensity level of 3 out of 3. The 21-minute duration paired with the high rhythm (34+ strokes per minute) and intense music selections imply a high-energy expenditure. This suggests an Extreme effort difficulty, especially with the focus on max effort, but may also be challenging for less fit users.",
