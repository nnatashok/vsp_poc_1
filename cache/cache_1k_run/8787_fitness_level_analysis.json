  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves rowing, which is generally classified between Beginner and Intermediate for technique difficulty. The 'Drive' type suggests a more dynamic use of the rowing machine, slightly elevating the technical challenge. Given the format of intervals and the 'drive' emphasis, this could require some nuanced skill, which aligns with Intermediate techniques. However, it remains accessible to motivated beginners with basic rowing form knowledge, hence scores for both Beginner (0.6) and Intermediate (0.8) levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity is marked 3 out of 3, indicating high energy demand. The duration of 16 minutes with intense interval formats (2-minute intervals followed by 60-second blasters) implies significant physical exertion, primarily for those less conditioned. Therefore, it aligns with Challenging and borders on Extreme effort, given the continuous high rhythm of up to 28 strokes per minute and minimal rest periods between blasters.",
