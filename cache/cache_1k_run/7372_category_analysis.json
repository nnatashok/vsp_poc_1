  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Bodyweight Strength,' clearly indicating that the primary focus is on strength exercises without additional weights, fitting well into the 'Body weight' category with a high score of 0.9. The description mentions moving from one lower body exercise to another, which further supports this classification. \n\nThe mention of being 'On The Mat' suggests the workout takes place on a mat with body-focused movements, giving 'Mat' a score of 0.7 as it aligns with general floor exercises that could include a variety of moves, possibly influenced by the title and description categorizations. \n\nThe optional mention of 'Yoga blocks' introduces a slight element of Yoga, hinting at yoga-inspired movements or modifications, hence a lower score of 0.3 for 'Yoga.' However, it's not explicitly a yoga session thanks to the stronger indicators of body weight strength training. \n\nThe music genre and playlist, consisting of high-energy dance and global hits, align with a workout aimed to keep the heart rate up, supporting the dynamic nature of bodyweight exercises. The absence of detailed elements typical to other potential categories like HIIT or Pilates confirms a focused classification on bodyweight exercises."
