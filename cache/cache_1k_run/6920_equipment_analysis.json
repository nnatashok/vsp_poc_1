  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout 'Yoga Align for the Spine' is categorized under 'On The Mat' which strongly indicates that a mat is essential. This is further supported by the image showing participants on mats. The workout is designed to release tension in the back and lengthen the spine, typically requiring a comfortable surface to perform various yoga poses. The metadata does not mention any other equipment, and the focus on stability and stillness aligns with mat-based exercises, justifying a high confidence score for the inclusion of a mat."
