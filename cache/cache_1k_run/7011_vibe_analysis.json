  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Standing Posture Align' is primarily categorized as 'align' suggesting a focus on posture and form, which aligns with 'The Zen Flow' that emphasizes grounding and intentional movement. The snowy mountains setting and outdoor environment support the 'Nature Flow' vibe as it involves connection with nature. The 'Groove Session' vibe is supported by the playful and upbeat music playlist featuring songs like 'Hips Don\u2019t Lie' and 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody,' adding a fun, expressive element. Although music genre and radio stations are chill or downtempo, the excitement from specific songs justifies 'Groove Session' inclusion with lower confidence. Overall, 'Standing Posture Align' integrates mindful flow with a lively twist, hence these vibe selections."
