However, because this is a 'row' workout, the Technique Difficulty must align to either Beginner or Intermediate. The absence of complex technical instructions and the HIIT format suggests mostly straightforward rowing, hence aligning more closely with Beginner and Intermediate Technique Difficulty levels.",
