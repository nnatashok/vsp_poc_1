The 'high intensity intervals' and max rhythm of 28, combined with workout intensity level 3 out of 3, imply this workout is physically demanding. The 21-minute duration also supports a 'Challenging' to 'Extreme' effort level, tailored for those accustomed to exertion. However, given the target audience, 'Challenging' is the primary classification since 'Extreme' might deter less motivated users.",
