  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is clearly categorized as a 'restore' session intended to help users 'wind down' and 'settle for sleep,' which are strong indicators of the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The use of terms like 'wind down' and 'settles you for sleep' aligns perfectly with the relaxing and recovery-focused nature of this spirit, warranting a score of 1.0. The music genres 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' further support a calming atmosphere.\n\nThe image shows a setting by a river with open space and natural elements, which aligns with the Outdoor & Adventure spirit, though this is less emphasized in the description. Hence, it is assigned a score of 0.7 due to the outdoor setting visible in the image. There is no indication of intensity, athleticism, or structured training, ruling out other spirits."
