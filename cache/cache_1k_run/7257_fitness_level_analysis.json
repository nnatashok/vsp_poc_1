Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration of 5:53 minutes, combined with the classification as a 'warm-up', indicates low energy demands. While the segment of 'building in rhythm' may introduce slight increases in intensity, the overall design as a warm-up suggests minimal energy expenditure, aligning it primarily with a Light effort difficulty and marginally with Moderate due to the interval format.",
