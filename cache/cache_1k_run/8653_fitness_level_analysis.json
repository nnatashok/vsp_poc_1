  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is just under 6 minutes and is intended as a 'cool down', focusing on low energy expenditure with chill music that suggests a relaxed intensity. The low rhythm of 22 implies minimal demand on cardiovascular and muscular systems. The design of this session to follow a hard workout further illustrates its purpose as a recovery activity, fitting squarely within the 'Light' effort difficulty category due to the very low physical demand.",
