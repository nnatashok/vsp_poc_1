  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 15-minute duration, combined with the 'flow' type and 'Chill' music genre, suggests a session that is unlikely to be highly intense, focusing instead on fluid movement and steady breathing. The absence of high-intensity cues in the metadata aligns with a light effort difficulty, suitable for beginners who may still be developing their fitness and endurance.",
