  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Power to Rhythm Row' is recorded on the Charles River, instantly suggesting an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The picturesque natural setting significantly aligns with exploration and environmental engagement, thus earning a high score of 0.9 in this category. The description indicates a transition between 'high power to high rhythms,' paired with a 'HIIT' format and maximum intensity level (3), which strongly supports the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit with a score of 0.8. The presence of quick transitions and focus on rhythm also introduces elements of 'Flow & Rhythm,' earning a score of 0.7, as the workout heavily utilizes music-driven pacing, evidenced by the rock and global hits serving to enhance coordination and movement dynamics. Despite these robust classifications, more explicit mentions of structured techniques or sports-specific drills are absent, leading to the exclusion of 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Sport & Agility' spirits."
