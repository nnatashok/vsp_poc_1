  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Yoga' based on several strong indicators in the metadata. The workout name 'Power Yoga Flow' and the description mentioning a 'faster paced power flow' directly indicate a yoga practice, specifically a dynamic style of yoga that might incorporate more vigorous movements. The mention of 'Yoga blocks recommended' suggests that this is indeed a yoga workout reflecting a potential need for yoga props. Additionally, the category 'On The Mat' supports the classification, indicating a floor-based practice commonly associated with yoga. Although the playlist includes vibrant and chill music, which could suit various workout types, it does not detract from the strong indicators of a yoga session. Given these clear signals, particularly the workout title and description, a high score is awarded for the Yoga category, with no significant evidence for other categories. Thus, this classification is made with high confidence."
