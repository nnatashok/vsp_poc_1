  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit assigned is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.9 due to the focus on 'bringing down your heart rate' and the explicit labeling as a 'cool down.' The gradual reduction of intensity is characteristic of a restorative approach. The use of an instructor named \"Mac\" suggests a guiding, calming presence, enhancing the soothing nature.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is included with a score of 0.6 because the workout's 'Reverse Climb' format suggests a rhythmic, controlled descent in intensity, and the presence of music aligns with rhythmic coordination.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is considered with a score of 0.5 despite limited explicit evidence because the rowing takes place in a natural setting, as shown in the image. The backdrop of water and boats connects the session to natural elements, which can provide an adventurous feel, though the primary focus remains on cooling down."
