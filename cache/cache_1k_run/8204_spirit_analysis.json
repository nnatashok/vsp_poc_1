  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout predominantly exemplifies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, evident from the HIIT format and the targeted high rhythms (28-34 strokes per minute), scoring 0.9. Additionally, the workout is set to a high-energy hip-hop playlist, further boosting its intensity. The classification of level 3 out of 3 in workout intensity supports this categorization.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also notable, meriting a score of 0.7. This is supported by the rhythmic element of the session, as participants are instructed to reach specific stroke rhythms, harmonizing speed and movement with music. This highlights the synchronization aspect typically seen in 'Flow & Rhythm' workouts.\n\nThe image of rowing on a river qualifies the workout for an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, scoring 0.7. The natural setting introduces environmental elements that align with exploration and adventure, even if the primary focus is intensity.\n\nOther spirits were considered but excluded as there are no indicators of restorative, structured, or sport-specific training elements."
