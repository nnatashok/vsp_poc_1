  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This 5-minute 'Spicy Warm-Up' involves short interval sprints prompted by simple cues, suggesting low energy expenditure typical of light effort difficulty. The inclusion of brief sprints every time a specific word is called out can up the effort slightly, implying a small touch into the moderate range. However, the primary classification remains 'Light' due to the workout's short duration and its categorization as a warm-up, suggesting minimal physical demand.",
