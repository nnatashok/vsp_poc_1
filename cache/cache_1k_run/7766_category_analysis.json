  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Stretching' due to the focus on 'shoulder mobility' and 'opening up the shoulders and upper body,' which suggests flexibility and range of motion exercises, common in stretching routines. The description does not imply intensity, complexity, or strength training, aligning well with 'Stretching' activities. The 'On The Mat' tag supports the inclusion of the 'Mat' category, indicating that exercises are likely performed on the floor without significant equipment. The absence of equipment and the short duration further support these classifications. Other categories like 'Yoga' or 'Pilates' were not chosen due to the lack of mindfulness, breathing work, or core-specific exercises typically associated with those workouts. The classification confidence is high due to strong indicators in the title and description, but moderate for 'Mat' due to the less explicit detailing of exercises performed."
