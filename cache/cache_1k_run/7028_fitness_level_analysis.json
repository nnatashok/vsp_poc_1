Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is 10 minutes and 15 seconds, indicating a relatively brief session that generally places it in the Light effort bracket. The inclusion of upbeat music genres such as Dance and Global Hits might suggest a more dynamic pace, providing some indication for Moderate effort if higher intensity movements are employed. However, given the focus on core strength and no indication of high intensity or extended periods, Light to Moderate effort seems reasonable.",
