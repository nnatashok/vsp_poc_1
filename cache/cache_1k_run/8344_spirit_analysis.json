  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Bodyweight Strength' led by Peter focuses on strengthening legs and abs using bodyweight exercises, fitting into the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit due to the nature of strength training, which typically follows a methodical routine. The description 'ignite your legs and abs' suggests a planned approach to targeted muscle groups, supporting this categorization with a score of 0.7.\n\nAdditionally, the visual evidence shows that the session takes place outdoors beside a city skyline, classifying it strongly within 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.8. The outdoor setting adds a dynamic element of exploration and environmental challenge, enhancing the workout's adventurous character.\n\nThe music playlist, featuring energetic tracks from artists like Snoop Dogg and DMX, adds vibrancy, but does not heavily influence the spirit classification beyond potentially enhancing the outdoor adventurous mood."
