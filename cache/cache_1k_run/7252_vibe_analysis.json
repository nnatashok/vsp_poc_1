  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Shifting Gears Row' seems to embody several vibes based on the metadata. The description mentions 'max effort intervals' with a 'shift in rhythm,' indicating a dynamic and high-intensity experience, aligning well with 'The Adrenaline Rush.' This is further supported by the hard-hitting rock music playlist (e.g., Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach), which typically accompanies intense workouts. The interval format and max rhythm of 34+ enhance this vibe further, leading to a score of 0.7.\n\nThe 'Meditative Grind' vibe is also applicable, as rowing typically involves repetitive and rhythmic motion, especially over a duration of 21 minutes. This aligns with endurance and zone-in qualities, justifying a score of 0.6.\n\nFinally, the presence of 'Rock Mid-intensity' and 'Global Hits' genres suggests an uplifting experience, although less intense than 'The Adrenaline Rush.' Thus, 'The Endorphin Wave' is also relevant, though less prominent, earning a 0.5 score."
