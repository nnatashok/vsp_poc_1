  "vibesExplanation": "The \"Travel Tips HIIT Row\" is a high-intensity interval workout, indicated by \"high intensity 1-minute intervals\" and \"intensity level: 3 out of 3,\" strongly suggesting \"The Warrior Workout\" vibe due to its challenging and sweat-dripping nature. The use of dance and global hits music, including songs like 'Good Life' and 'Push The Feeling On,' aligns with \"The Nightclub Workout,\" offering a lively and euphoric atmosphere, reflected in a 0.7 score. The workout's association with steady intervals and consistent rhythm may relate to \"The Endorphin Wave,\" indicating sustained energy and feel-good movement, though less prominently. The absence of instructor cues or complex choreography contributes to some uncertainty in classification, reflected in a moderate confidence level of 0.75. Overall, the combination of intense physical challenge, upbeat music, and rhythmic rowing suggests these vibes."
