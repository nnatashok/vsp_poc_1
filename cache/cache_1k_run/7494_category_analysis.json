  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Whole Body Circuit' and is described as focusing on the lower body and core. It takes place on the mat, suggesting a variety of bodyweight exercises or movements that don't require additional equipment. The duration is 20 minutes and 34 seconds which is typical for a circuit workout aimed at strength training. While the workout type explicitly states 'strength', there are no mentions of weights or resistance equipment, indicating an emphasis on bodyweight or mat-based exercises. The inclusion of energetic songs from genres like dance and global hits suggests a higher intensity workout. Therefore, 'Mat' is assigned a score of 0.7 due to its strong presence as indicated by the workout taking place 'on the mat.' 'Bodyweight' is scored at 0.6 since the workout focuses on strength without specified equipment, indicating bodyweight exercises. Other categories like 'Stretching' or 'Yoga' are excluded as the workout is explicitly strength-oriented and energetic, and no mentions of stretching or relaxation are provided."
