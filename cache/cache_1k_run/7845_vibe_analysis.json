  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'Sweat', involving intervals that build endurance and consistency, suggesting a meditative yet consistent effort common in 'The Meditative Grind'. The use of rhythm and endurance through intervals at a steady pace supports this classification, giving it a score of 0.7. Secondly, the 'Endorphin Wave' is considered as the workout maintains a steady build with intermediate intensity, aligning with elevated energy and steady progression, thus scoring 0.6. Lastly, 'The Groove Session' receives a lower score of 0.3 due to the rhythmic and repetitive style of the intervals, although the absence of dance elements and music genre specifics limits confidence in this classification. Lack of music genre specifics and limited information on mood descriptors place the overall vibe confidence at 0.7."
