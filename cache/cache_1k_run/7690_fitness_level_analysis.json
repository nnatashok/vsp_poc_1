  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized primarily as 'row' under 'Drive', which typically requires a higher understanding of rowing techniques than basic rowing sessions. Given the 'Drive' category and the 'HIIT' format, the technique difficulty aligns with intermediate, as it demands maintaining good form during variable intensity phases and requires more coordination than beginner level.",
