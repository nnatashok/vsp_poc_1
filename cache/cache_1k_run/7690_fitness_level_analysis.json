  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type \"Drive\" typically indicates a high level of technique sophistication needed, often providing an \"Advanced\" categorization. However, since the exercise category is 'row', the technique difficulty is best classified between Beginner and Intermediate. The structured intervals and focus on speed and power suggest a moderate level of technique sensitivity, tipping towards Intermediate but not necessarily advanced due to the rowing categorial constraint.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features 90\", 60\", and 30\" HIIT intervals, indicating significant physical intensity. Combined with the descriptor 'Drive' and an intensity of 3 out of 3, this suggests a very demanding session with high energy output. The playlist's energetic tracks further hint at supporting sustained high-effort rowing. This classifies the effort difficulty as Challenging, but on the cusp of Extreme due to the high-intensity focus.",
