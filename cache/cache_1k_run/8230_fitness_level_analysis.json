Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 30 minutes suggests a moderate to significant effort, especially considering it involves continuous bodyweight exercises to elevate heart rate. The strength focus implies exercises that require sustained effort engaging multiple muscle groups, aligning more with Moderate effort. The phrase 'elevate your heart rate' hints at a workout that might border on Challenging, but without more specific information about intensity or rest intervals, it leans towards Moderate but could be somewhat Challenging for less fit users.",
