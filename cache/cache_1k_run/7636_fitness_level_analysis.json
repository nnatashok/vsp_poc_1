  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given that this is a row workout, the technique difficulty is typically categorized as Beginner or Intermediate. The description mentions sprint intervals, which could suggest a slightly higher level of coordination, but the main action\u2014rowing\u2014remains consistent with Beginner or Intermediate technique. The user fitness level requirement being Intermediate suggests a slightly more complex utilization of rowing mechanics than a typical Beginner workout, possibly involving rhythm or pace variations, aligning with the provided metadata and Hydrow's rules.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves 16 minutes of interval rowing at a max rhythm of 26, which is moderately demanding. While the interval nature demands bursts of effort, it's not at the highest intensity level (2 out of 3). The intense sprint pace suggests some challenge for an unfit user, but not to the extent of being classified as Extreme. Hence, it leans towards a Moderate overall effort with some elements being Challenging due to the sprint pace.",
