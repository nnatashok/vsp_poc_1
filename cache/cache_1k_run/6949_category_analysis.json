  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Whole Body Pilates' and the description clearly indicate a Pilates session, confirming that 'Pilates' is the primary category. The mention of 'move through this whole body workout with Christie and Dani as the tide comes in at Mother's Beach' likely refers to the Pilates exercises being performed in a serene environment, aligning with the core and body alignment principles of Pilates, justifying a score of 1.0 for this category. The mention of 'On The Mat' in the category tag implies that the exercises are conducted on an exercise mat, supporting the assignment of 'Mat' as a secondary category with a score of 0.7, as it correctly categorizes the workout setting and method without conflicting with Pilates principles. The music genre and playlist provide ambiance but do not directly influence the workout type classifications. Other categories were excluded due to the strong and explicit indicators for Pilates and Mat."
