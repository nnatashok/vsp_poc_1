The post-row context and focus on unwinding reflect a low impact and low intensity, aligning with Light effort difficulty (score 0.7). However, pilates may include maintaining prolonged stabilizing positions, potentially requiring moderate energy expenditure, which accounts for a secondary Moderate level (score 0.3).",
