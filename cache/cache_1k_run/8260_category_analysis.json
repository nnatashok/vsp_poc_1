  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Pilates' with a score of 0.95 due to the clear mention of 'Core Pilates' in the workout name and a description indicating a core-focused Pilates session. The explicit reference to Pilates as the workout type further supports this categorization. \n\nThe secondary category is 'Mat', scored at 0.65, as the workout is described as being 'On The Mat' and involves exercises typical of mat-based routines, focusing on core engagement without the necessity of additional equipment. The keywords 'core-focused' and 'ignite your abs and obliques' suggest exercises performed on a mat.\n\nOther categories like 'Body weight' or 'Stretching' were considered but excluded as the primary focus on Pilates and core-specific exercises were more explicitly indicated. The lack of equipment and focus on mat exercises also diminished the relevance of other potential categories. The confidence level is high due to clear and specific indications of the workout type in the provided metadata."
