  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily rowing-based, which involves basic movement patterns requiring minimal coordination. The metadata indicates a 'row' category under the Hydrow platform, suggesting a maximum Technique Difficulty of 'Intermediate.' Since no complex movements or high coordination exercises are listed, a 'Beginner' level is more appropriate, but considering the 'Intermediate' fitness requirement stated by the user, a low score for 'Intermediate' is added.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is relatively short at 11 minutes and 17 seconds but uses an interval format ('1' on, 1' off'), indicating bursts of higher intensity activity with short rest. With a workout intensity of 2 out of 3, this suggests moderate energy expenditure. The rhythm maxing at 28 and the 'sweat' workout type imply some challenge, but not extreme. Therefore, 'Moderate' is appropriate with a contribution from 'Challenging' due to interval nature and intensity level.",
