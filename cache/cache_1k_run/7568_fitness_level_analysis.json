  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category with a sweat workout type, which aligns with Hydrow's specific guideline to consider Technique Difficulty as Beginner or Intermediate. The rhythm is set at a manageable 18, typically requiring less advanced technique, aligning with Beginner difficulty (score: 0.6). However, the description mentions 'big power at low speeds', indicating a slightly more complex rowing technique, justifying a partial inclusion for Intermediate (score: 0.4). The confidence is high based on Hydrow's rules.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 21 minutes and max rhythm 18, this workout suggests moderate to challenging effort, particularly due to the power focus at low cadence. The workout intensity indicator of 2 out of 3 supports this as moderately intense. The 'sweat' type suggests a solid calorie-burning session, hence Moderate effort (score: 0.6) is most suitable but the 'big power' aspect suggests some users might find it Challenging (score: 0.4). The confidence is high as these cues consistently suggest a green to amber effort level.",
