  "categoriesConfidence": 0.9,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The title 'Instructional: Handle Movement' and the description focusing on 'bring efficiency to your stroke with Mac while focusing on handle movement' strongly suggest this is an indoor rowing workout. The mention of 'stroke' is a clear indicator of rowing, as this term is frequently associated with this activity. The category list includes 'warm-up' and 'row,' with 'row' further pointing towards rowing exercises. Although the metadata labels this as a warm-up, this does not change its core focus as a rowing instructional session. The score of 0.8 is assigned due to very clear explicit hints pointing towards indoor rowing, and the categories confidence is high at 0.9 given the strong evidence. Other categories were excluded due to lack of explicit cues for activities like Stretching or Yoga."
