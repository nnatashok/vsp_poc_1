  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Steady Cool-Down' and involves rowing, as indicated by phrases like 'row steadily' in the description, and is explicitly tagged with 'row.' This makes 'Indoor rowing' the most relevant category. The exercise is designed to gradually bring down heart rate, indicating a less intense, steady rowing session, rather than a high-intensity activity. The use of a rowing machine is strongly implied, reinforcing the categorization. While it includes elements of a cool-down, the session does not fit into categories like 'Stretching,' 'Yoga,' or 'Meditation' due to the clear rowing emphasis. The confidence level is high (0.9) due to multiple explicit indicators from the metadata confirming the rowing aspect."
