This is a 'breathe' type workout with a focus on cardio and stories, indicating a less technical emphasis, aligning with Beginner. Furthermore, the workout intensity level is 1 out of 3, and the User Fitness Level Requirement is set to Beginner. Given these factors, Beginner is the primary classification, with a slight potential for Intermediate due to the rowing element.",
