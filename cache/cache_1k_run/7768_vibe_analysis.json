  "vibesExplanation": "The workout vibe for 'Let Go and Row' can be classified primarily as 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.7. This is derived from the description's emphasis on 'breathe, observe, and then act,' suggesting a focused, repetitive endurance-like experience typical for rowing workouts lasting over 20 minutes. The interval format further supports this vibe as it requires sustained attention and repetition.\n\nThe 'Nightclub Workout' vibe scores 0.6 due to the playlist's inclusion of dance and upbeat tracks, such as 'Get It Poppin'' and 'Riva (Restart The Game),' aligning with a nightclub-like energetic and musical experience.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' scores 0.65, given the duration and intensity level (3 out of 3), which indicates a high-energy, feel-good experience. The Radio Stations Played ('Dance high, Global Hits') suggests a continuous rhythmic and uplifting musical backdrop conducive to endorphin release.\n\nOverall, these vibes capture the workout's combination of endurance, musical energy, and the potential for a transformative rowing session."
