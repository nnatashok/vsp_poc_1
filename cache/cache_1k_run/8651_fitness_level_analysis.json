  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which typically involves repetitive rhythmic rowing that does not require advanced technical skill. The interval format suggests some variations in intensity, but the primary rowing motion remains straightforward for users familiar with rowing. As per Hydrow's rules, this aligns with a Beginner to Intermediate level technique difficulty, especially since rowing is the primary component.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of 16 minutes, which is not excessively long, but the interval format indicates varying effort levels, adding a layer of challenge. The intensity level is specified as 2 out of 3, which suggests a considerable physical demand. Consequently, the effort difficulty aligns between Moderate and Challenging, given the mix of interval training which elevates the intensity.",
