  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive', which according to Hydrow-specific rules, categorizes Technique Difficulty as Advanced due to the requirement for a good sense of rhythm and pacing, especially at peak rhythms of 32. However, 'row' category typically aligns with Beginner to Intermediate. Given the Fitness Level Requirements, techniques may involve advanced pacing techniques, but rowing remains fundamentally less complex than multi-component workouts, justifying both Intermediate and Advanced consideration.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 16 minutes and the high rhythm intensity of a max rhythm of 32 suggest a physically demanding workout, especially for those who are not highly conditioned. The description emphasizes maximizing efforts within short bursts ('one-minute efforts'), suggesting a high effort intensity despite the short duration. Thus, it aligns with a Challenging effort level given its significant physical demands and elevated drive challenge.",
