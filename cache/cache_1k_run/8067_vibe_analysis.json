  "vibesExplanation": "The workout '4-Minute Intervals Row' features two 4-minute intervals with varying rhythms, suggesting a steady, repetitive nature typical of 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, supporting focus and endurance over a moderate duration. The use of rock and global hits contributes to a steady, uplifting experience, aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave,' which emphasizes feel-good, sustained energy. Classic rock tracks like 'Lookin' Out My Back Door' and 'More Than A Feeling' add an element of rhythm and drive, leading to 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicates a workout that is engaging but not extremely intense, supporting these conclusions. The chosen vibes are based on the rhythmic and repetitive nature, music style, and moderate intensity."
