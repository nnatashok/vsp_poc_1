Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's focus on mobility suggests low energy expenditure and low physical demand. Its short duration of around 11 minutes and the lack of intense descriptions align it with a Light effort. The workout is described as a complement to a rowing session (\"ideal for after any row\"), reinforcing its supportive, low-intensity nature, meant for recovery rather than primary exertion, which supports the rating of Light for effort difficulty.",
