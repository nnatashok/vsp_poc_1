  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a short duration of just over 10 minutes and a focus on pilates, which generally involves controlled, lower-intensity exercises, the workout is likely to require a Light to Moderate effort level. The lack of intensity cues such as high-paced or strenuous activities, combined with gentle core strengthening and stretching, suggests that energy expenditure would be quite low, typical for deconditioned users. While it is tailored to keep the effort manageable, the inclusion of core 'burn' might add a moderate challenge for beginners.",
