  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "At just over 10 minutes, this workout is short, which typically implies a lighter effort difficulty. Pilates emphasizes controlled, precise movements rather than high intensity, aligning with a Light to Moderate effort difficulty. The music style and 'Core Burn' label suggest some engaging activity, but not overly taxing due to its short duration and Pilates focus. Thus, a Light effort aligns well, with a Moderate level considered due to the core focus which can pose slight challenges for very deconditioned users.",
