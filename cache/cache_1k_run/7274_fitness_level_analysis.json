  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of 30 minutes and includes a steady-paced classical pilates structure, which often involves continuous movement and poses maintaining core tension. This implies a moderate level of effort due to sustained activity with possible short pauses between exercises. The use of motivating, upbeat music with dance and global hits may enhance energy expenditure slightly, justifying a moderate emphasis (0.7) on effort difficulty with some challenging aspects (0.4) for those less conditioned.",
