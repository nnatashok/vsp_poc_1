  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to the focus on relaxation and tension release in the description. The use of gentle stretching and optional yoga blocks further supports this classification, emphasizing relaxation and stress reduction. Additionally, the playlist featuring mellow and calming tracks like 'Kiss The Rain' by Yiruma and 'Blonde' by Roger Eno reinforces this calming and restorative atmosphere, justifying a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant but to a lesser extent. The workout is filmed outdoors with a scenic backdrop, as indicated by the image provided, which ties in with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' category. However, the primary focus remains on restoration rather than adventure, resulting in a score of 0.5. The music and gentle nature of the workout do not strongly support a high-adventure classification, thus preventing a higher score."
