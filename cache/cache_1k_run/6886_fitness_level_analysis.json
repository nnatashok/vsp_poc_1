Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is very short, under six minutes, and it is primarily characterized as a 'warm-up'. This inherently points towards a lower effort difficulty. While the progression from very light to max effort indicates some increase in exertion, the brevity of the session and the primary 'warm-up' designation suggest that it cannot be very demanding overall. Hence, it predominantly fits in the Light category, with some aspects that slightly lean towards Moderate due to intensity variations mentioned.",
