  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.95,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as Light due to the nature of a 'cool down' session, which traditionally requires minimal physical exertion. The short duration of 5 minutes and 37 seconds further supports low effort intensity. The steady format implies consistent low-impact movements aimed at relaxation rather than exertion. Such sessions focus on recovery and are not physically demanding, thus suitable for all fitness levels.",
