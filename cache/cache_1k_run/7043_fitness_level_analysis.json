  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This is a 10-minute warm-up aimed at priming the body for a rowing race, suggesting low intensity suited for warm-up rather than exhaustive exertion. The short duration and categorization under 'mobility' indicate a light energy expenditure, ideal for beginners. The dynamic nature could slightly increase the intensity, giving a less prominent score for 'Moderate'. The playlist with upbeat songs might encourage a more engaging pace, but is not enough to shift it beyond 'Light'.",
