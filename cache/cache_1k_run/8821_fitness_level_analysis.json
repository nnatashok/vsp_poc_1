Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session lasts about 21 minutes with structured EMOM intervals, promoting moderate continuous intensity. Incorporating dumbbells increases energy expenditure but remains controlled. The workout employs a 1-minute work interval and includes a rhythm cap at 24, which allows consistent effort but doesn't encourage extreme intensity. While challenging for deconditioned users due to interval style and resistance, it largely stays in the Moderate range for effort difficulty due to its shorter duration and pacing.",
