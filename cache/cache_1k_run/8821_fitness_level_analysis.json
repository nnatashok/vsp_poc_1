Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's 20-minute duration with elements of an EMOM format and the use of dumbbells indicate a routine that is likely to elevate heart rate and demand reasonable effort, particularly for less conditioned individuals. High rhythm and the instructor's description of a 'fast-paced, spicy style' suggest a higher effort difficulty, but not excessively so. Moderate (0.6) effort is appropriate due to the structured intervals, with a Challenging (0.4) score for the additional intensity provided by minimal rest periods and dumbbell resistance.",
