  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit assigned is 'Soothing & Restorative,' with a high score of 0.8. This classification is based on several factors: the workout title 'Slow It Down Cool-Down' and description phrases like 'Take a breath' and 'slow down your rhythm,' which explicitly indicate a focus on relaxation and recovery rather than intensity or high-energy exertion. Additionally, the sunset setting implied in 'at sunset' contributes to a calming and restorative atmosphere.\n\nThe secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm,' is given a score of 0.6 due to the mention of 'rhythm' in both the title and description. This suggests an emphasis on a smooth and continuous movement pace, integrating music-driven elements. The 'Max rhythm: 22' further supports this by outlining a tempo-controlled session, although not as dominantly as the restorative elements.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility,' are excluded due to a lack of indicators related to high intensity or sports-specificity. Despite the presence of an Olympian coach, the context here is clearly set on cool-down and relaxation."
