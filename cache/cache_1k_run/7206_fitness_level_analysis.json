Given that it's a rowing workout, the technique difficulty cannot exceed Intermediate. The expected rhythm and format elements (pyramid) suggest some coordination and endurance are beneficial, justifying a strong Beginner score and a moderate Intermediate score.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is approximately 11 minutes and 28 seconds, structured in 4-minute intervals. The 'sweat' category and an intensity level classified as '2 out of 3' suggest a significant cardiovascular effort, aligning with Moderate effort, while the short duration prevents a full Challenging classification. The pyramid format may increase intensity perception slightly, but overall the energy expenditure is likely to be moderate for most users.",
