  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'The Zen Flow' due to its location by the water and mountains in Norway, implying a calming, nature-connected vibe. The description 'Power Flow' suggests a yoga-based session focused on intentional movement, aligning well with a breath-centered and unhurried nature of this vibe, earning a strong score of 0.9. 'The Meditative Grind' is also applicable, as the term 'flow' and a duration of 21 minutes suggest consistent movement and repetition, common in meditative and endurance activities, fitting a moderate score of 0.7. 'The Groove Session' scores 0.5 as the music playlist includes chill and downtempo tracks, which supports a fluid and expressive session. The absence of high-intensity descriptors or competitive elements rules out more intense or adrenaline-focused vibes."
