  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Chest Opening Align', and explicitly mentions a yoga practice with intention to 'open up your chest', which is a strong indicator of a Yoga routine focused on improving flexibility and alignment. The mention of 'yoga align' further reinforces this classification, pointing towards yoga movements aimed at chest opening. The optional use of 'yoga blocks' aligns with traditional yoga practice which often includes props. The playlist's chill, downtempo selection suggests a relaxed, meditative vibe common in yoga classes. Given these factors, 'Yoga' is the principal category with a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe term 'opening up your chest' also suggests a degree of stretching, as chest opener exercises are typically included in flexibility training regimes to increase range of motion in the upper body. Thus, 'Stretching' was included as a secondary category but with a lower score of 0.4, because there was a stronger emphasis on yoga as a structured practice rather than purely flexibility work."
