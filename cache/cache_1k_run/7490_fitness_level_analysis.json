Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration of 5 minutes and 46 seconds, along with 'warm-up' descriptors, suggests the physical demand is minimal, strongly aligning with Light effort (0.9). The purpose is to incrementally increase rhythm and effort, slightly hinting at a low-moderate challenge, giving a minimal score for Moderate (0.3). The use of 'warm-up' in the category reinforces a light-effort expectation, promoting conservative classification as Light.",
