  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"The Reboot Workout\" due to its focus on posture, cool-down nature, and the relaxing aspect of the rowing session. The title \"Decompress Cool-Down\" and description phrases like \"relax into your stroke\" strongly suggest a focus on deep stretching and low-stress movement, fitting the Reboot Workout vibe. The music stations \"Rock low\" and \"Global Hits\" may not strongly influence the vibe but support a relaxing atmosphere. The \"Zen Flow\" vibe is also considered due to the meditative and breath-centered quality implied by the phrase \"relax into your stroke together,\" and the intentional focus on posture, aligning with the grounding and unhurried nature of Zen Flow workouts."
