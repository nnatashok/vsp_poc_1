  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout focuses on perfecting posture, which aligns well with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit due to its instructional and methodical approach to body positioning and technique, scoring 0.7. The phrases 'practice sitting tall' and 'Instructional' suggest a disciplined focus on form. Given the calm nature of working on posture with a low max rhythm of 20 and as a warm-up, it also aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, scoring 0.6. The description emphasizes a relaxed and restorative practice with elements aimed at prioritizing posture without intense exertion. The image and description, mentioning the 'Boston skyline,' indicate a natural, outdoor setting, suggesting elements of 'Outdoor & Adventure,' scoring 0.5. This is supported further by the visual presence of the skyline which implies a connection with the outdoor environment. The absence of high-energy tags or emphasis on speed excludes 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' from consideration."
