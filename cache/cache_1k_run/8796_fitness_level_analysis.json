  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Beginner Bodyweight Circuit' with a focus on whole body exercises performed off the Hydrow and 90-second intervals on Hydrow. Since the workout includes rowing ('Hydrow' segment), the technique difficulty can correspond to either Beginner or Intermediate levels. The circuit's bodyweight nature and the workout name suggest a simpler, straightforward execution, justifying a strong alignment with Beginner (score: 0.8). However, the EMOM format does require maintaining pace, justifying a moderate score for Intermediate (0.4).",

The workout duration is approximately 21 minutes, not overly taxing but could become moderately challenging due to repeated intervals. The use of terms like 'spicy style' hints at slightly increased effort, aligning strongly with Moderate (score: 0.7) and partially with Challenging (score: 0.3) in terms of energy expenditure, especially for beginners.",
