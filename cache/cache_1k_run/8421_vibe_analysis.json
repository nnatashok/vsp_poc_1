  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Flow' features a core-focused flow, suggesting a meditative and controlled exercise, aligning it with 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.7 due to its core emphasis and flow nature. The recommendation of a yoga block and the term 'flow' support this vibe. The music playlist, featuring chill and downtempo tracks, leans towards 'The Zen Flow,' scoring 0.65, emphasizing a grounding, intentional practice. Additionally, 'The Groove Session' is a fit with a score of 0.5, indicated by the song choices that add a fun, fluid quality to the session. The lack of intense, rapid movements rules out more vigorous vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout.'"
