  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'row', which typically indicates either Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty. The description emphasizes building a cardio base with low rhythms, suggesting simpler rowing techniques more accessible to beginners. Given the 'breathe' type and standard row category, the movements are likely straightforward, aligning strongly with Beginner level. Intermediate score reflects potential challenges in maintaining form over duration for less experienced users, justifying a slight overlap into Intermediate level.",
