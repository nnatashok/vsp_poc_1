  "spiritsExplanation": "The selected spirits for this workout are 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined'. The title 'Master the Movement Row' suggests a focus on coordinated movement, aligning well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The description further emphasizes rhythmical movement and proper technique, reinforced by the max rhythm tag of 26, indicating a structured pace that supports this classification. The presence of instructors and the emphasis on climbing steadily implies progressive instruction, adding an element of 'Structured & Disciplined'. The format 'Climb' suggests a gradual increase in effort with technique precision, supporting this classification. The workout intensity is low ('1 out of 3') and targeted towards beginners, indicating a methodical approach over high exertion. Hence, 'High-Energy & Intense' was not a fit. The absence of nature-related elements in the metadata rules out 'Outdoor & Adventure'. The content's focus on technique over recovery excludes 'Soothing & Restorative'. Thus, these choices align well with a focus on rhythmic and structured practice, each with scores reflecting their relevance to the described session."
