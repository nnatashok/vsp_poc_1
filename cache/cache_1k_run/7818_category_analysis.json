  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'Indoor rowing' due to the explicit mention of 'row at a rhythm 22' in the workout description and the consistent focus on rowing exercises in conjunction with breathing elements. The title 'Steady Fundamentals Row' strongly indicates rowing as the central activity. The format described as steady with a rhythm and low intensity supports a rowing session, particularly at a comfortable pace, which aligns with a fundamental or introductory rowing workout. The mention of breathing as part of the workout ('Workout Type: breathe') provides additional context for pacing and rhythm but does not pivot the classification away from rowing. Although breathing is a component, the predominant feature is the rowing exercise, making 'Indoor rowing' the most appropriate category with high confidence."
