  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Travel Questions Row' suggests a gradual build-up in rhythm and intensity, typical of 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, as it involves rowing, a repetitive, endurance-focused activity. The max rhythm reaching only 26 strokes per minute and an intensity level of 1 out of 3 indicates a moderate and controlled session rather than high-intensity bursts, justifying a score of 0.7 for 'The Meditative Grind.' The inclusion of mainstream, easy-listening pop music supports an 'Endorphin Wave' vibe, as such music is often uplifting and helps in maintaining steady energy, fitting leisurely, endurance activities. The score of 0.6 reflects this alignment. Lastly, the social, interactive elements of getting to know the instructors align with 'The Groove Session,' promoting fun and immersion, though it's not the primary focus, giving it a slightly lower score of 0.5."
