  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Whole Body Circuit\" suggests an intensive routine given the mention of a total body focus with intervals, typical of high-intensity circuit training. The use of dumbbells and the EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute) format further supports the classification of 'High-Energy & Intense' as it implies a fast-paced workout designed to maximize effort. This earns a strong score of 0.75.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is relevant due to the EMOM format, which requires adherence to a set schedule and structured progression through exercises, thus scoring a 0.7. The description and structure suggest methodical training rather than freestyle or fluid pacing.\n\nThe category \"On The Mat\" and setting, while indoors, do not suggest 'Outdoor & Adventure.' No elements of relaxation indicate 'Soothing & Restorative.' Music stations imply energy but not enough for 'Flow & Rhythm.' Thus, these spirits are excluded."
