  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Signature Flow' with a 45-minute duration suggests a focus on fluid and continuous movements. The description mentioning 'Owen's cues' and 'signature flow' implies a guided, intentional practice. The flow type and on-the-mat category indicate a likely connection to yoga or a similar discipline.\n\nThe music genre, featuring chill, downtempo tracks and artists like RY X, Billie Eilish, and Max Richter, supports a calming, immersive environment consistent with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The absence of fast-paced, high-energy music further suggests a focus on mindfulness and breath-centered movement.\n\n'Groove Session' is relevant due to the expressive nature of flow workouts, enhanced by the remixed, rhythmic music tracks that could create a mindful rhythm during the workout. \n\nFinally, elements of 'The Meditative Grind' are present due to the focus on repetition and duration, allowing for a meditative state through ongoing, flowing movements.\n\nThe confidence is high due to the alignment of the workout type, music selection, and title with these vibes."
