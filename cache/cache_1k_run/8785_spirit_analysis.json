  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a high confidence (score of 0.8) due to the mention of rowing 'through the rain' and the image showing the sessions conducted outdoors on a river. The 'Cross Training Row' and 'steady format' further imply an outdoor exploratory element.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant with a moderate confidence (score of 0.6) because of the workout's description emphasizing proper technique and a 'breathe' category, indicating a focus on mindfulness and relaxation rather than intensity. The music selection, including artists like 'Jamiroquai' and 'The Decemberists,' supports a calming, reflective atmosphere.\n\nThe use of a low workout intensity (1 out of 3) and the 'steady' rhythm align with gentle, restorative qualities. High-Energy & Intense was not chosen due to the low intensity and slower rhythm design of the workout."
