  "categoriesExplanation": "The metadata for the workout titled \"Guided Row: Find Your Stride\" indicates that it is performed on a rowing machine. The description mentions \"vocally guided journey\" and categories related to \"row.\" The format specifies \"steady,\" and the maximum rhythm of 22 strokes per minute suggests a controlled rowing pace. These details strongly point to an indoor rowing workout. The workout type and category listed as \"Journey\" relates to the style of the rowing session, enhancing the rowing experience rather than altering its fundamental nature. The rock mid-intensity music aligns with an endurance-focused workout pace, common in rowing sessions. Therefore, 'Indoor rowing' is assigned with a high confidence score of 0.9, reflecting the strong presence of rowing-specific terms."
