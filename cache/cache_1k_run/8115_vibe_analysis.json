  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily a stretching session focused on loosening up after rowing, which aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' due to its repetitive and focused nature. The inclusion of music genres like 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' adds a beat-driven component, but the core activity is stretching, so it remains meditative. The setting along \"the shores of Norway\" and the stretching focus suggest a calming and refreshing vibe, supporting 'The Reboot Workout' theme, which aims for a total-body refresh and relaxation. The lack of specified intense or high-energy elements reduces the suitability for more active categories."
