  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and 'breathe', indicating a focus on rowing with controlled breathing. Rowing is generally considered a full-body workout that involves rhythmic and repetitive movements, contributing to a potential rating of Beginner. However, the pyramid format introduces variability in the intervals and rhythm (max rhythm 26), suggesting a slight increase in complexity, justifying the Intermediate level as well. Given the User Fitness Level Requirements are Beginner, the primary focus is on straightforward rowing movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is 21 minutes, and while it is a cardio-based row, the description and intensity rating (level 1 out of 3) suggest that it's designed to be approachable for less fit users. The pyramid format with increasing rhythm adds a moderate degree of effort, but overall, the activity likely remains accessible for most beginners. The use of popular music with a 'breathe' workout type further implies a controlled, less intense session.",
