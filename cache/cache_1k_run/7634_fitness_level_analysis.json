  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under the 'row' category. According to the Hydrow-specific rule, rowing workouts have a default technique difficulty of either Beginner or Intermediate. Given that this workout is titled 'Step Pyramid Row' with focus on intervals rather than complex technique, and it aligns with a 'grade 1 intensity' out of 3, its movements are likely to be simpler favoring the Beginner level. However, the dynamic rhythm changes introduced may indicate some minor adjustments required, thus a slight consideration for Intermediate. Hence, an 80% alignment with Beginner with minor complexity noted for Intermediate at 20%.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This workout's duration is 21 minutes with a pyramid format, often involving intervals starting easy and building up. The workout's assigned intensity level is 1 out of 3, suggesting a lower end of intensity and energy expenditure, consistent with Light effort difficulty. However, the increase in rhythm to a max of 26 and the pyramid structure, which can be slightly demanding, align partially with a Moderate level, but with the strong Light positioning at 70%, especially for a deconditioned user.",
