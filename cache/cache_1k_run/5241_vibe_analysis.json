  "vibesExplanation": "This workout video, titled 'Fix Your Posture,' is focused on mobility and aims to improve posture through a quick session. The words 'mobilize' and 'improve your posture' strongly suggest a restorative and gentle approach, aligning well with 'The Reboot Workout,' which is characterized by deep stretching and low stress. The very short duration of 5 minutes and 36 seconds also indicates a quick, refreshing session rather than an intense workout.\n\nAdditionally, the radio stations played like 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits,' along with tracks like 'When The Bassline Drops' and 'Never Too Much,' imply a rhythmic and possibly calming vibe, supporting the inclusion of 'The Zen Flow' as it involves a grounding, intentional experience.\n\nThe lack of specified equipment and the 'on the mat' category further reinforce a focused, surface-based flow. Overall, the vibes chosen reflect the restorative and calming nature of the workout, with a high confidence level due to explicit indicators in the metadata."
