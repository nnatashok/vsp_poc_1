  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type categorization as 'row' automatically places the technique difficulty at either 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate' per Hydrow-specific guidelines. Given the lack of any complex instructions or specialized movements mentioned, this workout likely focuses on maintaining rowing basics, which aligns strongly with 'Beginner' technique difficulty. The inclusion of intervals may add slight complexity, thus 'Intermediate' is included, but less prominently.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of about 16 minutes with an intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggests a moderately intense workout. Intervals could mean bursts of higher intensity effort interspersed with rest, pushing it towards moderate. The 'sweat' category and emphasis on pace maintenance suggest a moderately demanding effort, with some potential for challenge during high-intensity intervals.",
