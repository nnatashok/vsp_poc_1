  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Kids' Table Row' workout is categorized under 'row', which inherently limits the technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate levels per Hydrow's rules. The metadata describes it as a Thanksgiving-themed interval session with a max rhythm of 32. The interval format implies a need for some coordination but does not suggest complex movement patterns beyond rowing basics. Therefore, we assign a Beginner score of 0.6 and an Intermediate score of 0.7 due to the structured intervals, aligning with the intermediate user requirement.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 21:24 with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, which indicates a session that involves a fair amount of effort. The 'sweat' workout type suggests moderate energy expenditure, suitable for less fit users, while intervals naturally elevate effort. Thus, we assign a Moderate level with a score of 0.7, recognizing the energy demand, and a Challenging score of 0.5, due to the sustained core engagement and marginally higher intensity for novices.",
