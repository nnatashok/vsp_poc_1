  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which typically implies either Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty due to its straightforward motion of rowing, which involves some coordination but is generally uncomplicated. The format is 'sweat' and involves interval training, suggesting intermediate characteristics, but the exercise remains simple because it's rowing. The dedicated rowing category limits the movements' complexity. Confidence is high given the straightforward nature of rowing workouts and its alignment with the assigned fitness level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is approximately 21 minutes with an intensity level of 2 out of 3. This, combined with an interval structure, suggests a moderate to challenging effort difficulty. The use of a rhythm max of 32 indicates potential bursts of increased pace. Music selections like pop and high-energy genres support a moderately intense workout suitable for engaging but not overly exertive activity. Confidence is high due to clear duration and intensity cues.",
