  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', which typically involves straightforward rowing techniques. This aligns with the 'Beginner' technique difficulty level. The presence of intervals suggests a small potential for variability, slightly leaning towards 'Intermediate'. However, as per the Hydrow-specific rule for rowing, 'Intermediate' can be considered but given the beginner fitness level requirement and the category, 'Beginner' is more emphasized.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of 4-minute and 30-second intervals over a 31-minute duration, promoting endurance and cardio development, which surpasses a 'Light' level. An intensity level of 1 out of 3, while not overly demanding, indicates the session requires continuous effort that fits a 'Moderate' effort difficulty. The classification leans towards 'Moderate' but acknowledges some 'Challenging' elements due to the interval format that requires sustained engagement.",
