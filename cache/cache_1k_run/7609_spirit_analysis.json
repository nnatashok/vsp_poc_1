  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under \"High-Energy & Intense\" with a score of 0.9. The description emphasizes sprint pace during intervals and max effort at the finish, indicating a fast-paced and highly exertive session. The playlist features rock songs with high energy, further supporting this classification.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is also present with a score of 0.8, as the image shows the workout occurring on a river, incorporating natural elements into the session. This setup naturally aligns with exploration and environmental challenges typical of outdoor workouts.\n\n\"Structured & Disciplined\" is scored at 0.6 due to the workout's interval format and maximum rhythm specification (32 strokes per minute), suggesting methodical training and adherence to precise performance metrics.\n\nThe \"Soothing & Restorative\" and \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirits were excluded due to the high intensity and structured nature of the session, which do not prioritize relaxation or continuous, smooth movement. \"Sport & Agility\" was also not chosen, as there are no explicit mentions of agility or sports-specific skills."
