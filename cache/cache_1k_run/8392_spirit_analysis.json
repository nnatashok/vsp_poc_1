  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Standing Dynamic Mobility,' with a focus on warming up without kneeling or lying down, suggests a gentle, rhythmic session that aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The use of pop and global hits music, like 'I Believe' by the Jonas Brothers, likely encourages smooth and continuous movement patterns, justifying a score of 0.7 for 'Flow & Rhythm.'\n\nThe description emphasizes warming up, a restorative aspect, which fits the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This is reinforced by the gentle nature implied by the avoidance of knee and back exercises, earning it a score of 0.6.\n\nThe workout is also conducted outdoors, on a platform by the water with a city skyline, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The natural setting adds an element of exploration, supporting a score of 0.5.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structurally & Disciplined' are excluded due to the emphasis on a gentle, warming approach rather than intensity or methodical structure."
