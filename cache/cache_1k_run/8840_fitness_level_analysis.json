  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'cool-down' lasting less than six minutes. Cool-downs are usually designed to lower heart rates rather than elevate them and generally feature low intensity to help the body transition to rest. With music being non-intense ('Country, Global Hits') and no indication of high-energy expenditure or sustained effort, this aligns with a Light effort difficulty. The short duration further supports this level of effort classification with high confidence.",
