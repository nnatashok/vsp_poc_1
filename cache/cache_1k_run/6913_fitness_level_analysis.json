  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' in a rowing context suggests intermediate difficulty due to the emphasis on technique and power application, as supported by the advanced level requirement in the metadata. The HIIT format typically includes complex timing and pacing rather than movement technique complexity, setting it firmly as Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity level is rated 3 out of 3, indicating a highly demanding session. The 17-minute duration with high-intensity intervals (HIIT) suggests a demanding workout. The format likely involves short rest periods, consistent with a 'challenging' to 'extreme' effort level, and supported by the 'Drive' category known for advanced rowing workouts.",
