  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 10:41, indicating a relatively short session. Resistance band training requires moderate effort, as it involves sustained muscle engagement, particularly given the focus on 'corrective movements'. Although the workout is only around 10 minutes long, suggesting low energy expenditure, the requirement of maintaining proper form for posture and engagement throughout gives it light to moderate effort difficulty. Thus, it aligns primarily at Light but crosses slightly into Moderate.",
