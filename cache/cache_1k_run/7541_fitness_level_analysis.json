  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of approximately 10 minutes suggests a relatively brief session, reducing overall exertion demands. Resistance band exercises are generally low to medium intensity, with energy expenditure depending on the resistance applied. Thus, it aligns well with a 'Moderate' level, with a minor 'Challenging' aspect for unconditioned users.",
