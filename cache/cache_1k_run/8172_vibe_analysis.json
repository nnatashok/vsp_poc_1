  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.75. This is due to the rowing focus, a steady, rhythmic exercise often associated with a meditative, repetitive flow. The description includes a focus on getting to know Aisyah while rowing, suggesting a calm, engaging experience rather than an intense high-energy session.\n\nThe endorphin-boosting musical choice, including upbeat pop tracks from artists like Sia and Ti\u00ebsto, adds elements of 'The Endorphin Wave' with a score of 0.6. These songs can create an energized, feel-good atmosphere, aligning with steady rowing.\n\nA bit of 'The Zen Flow' vibe is present, with a score of 0.4, as the 'breathe' workout type and the scenic outdoor setting contribute to a grounding, breath-centered approach. The intensity level is low (1 out of 3), which correlates with a more relaxed and calming vibe rather than a vigorous workout."
