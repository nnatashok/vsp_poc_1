  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout falls under the 'row' category, inherently limiting the technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The description \"build confidence stroke by stroke\" implies a focus on fundamental skill development, suggesting simpler movements aligned with the Beginner level. The use of intervals at lower rhythms and a max rhythm of 26 supports a somewhat manageable technique, with a slight Intermediate consideration but primarily fitting the Beginner category.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 21 minutes and 29 seconds, with the 'breathe' type and an intensity level of 1 out of 3 indicating low exertion. Given the format specifies lower rhythm intervals, the effort is likely minimal, suitable for complete beginners, aligning strongly with Light effort difficulty. The intervals may introduce a slight Moderate challenge, but overall it's tailored for low energy expenditure.",
