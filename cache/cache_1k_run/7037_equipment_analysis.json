  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'On The Mat,' which strongly suggests that a mat is needed for this stretching routine. The focus on stretching hip flexors and adductors typically involves positions that benefit from a cushioned surface, likely a mat, to provide comfort and stability. Given this is a post-row stretch, it aligns with activities commonly performed on a mat, justifying a high confidence level of 0.9 for the requirement of a mat. No other equipment is explicitly mentioned or suggested in the metadata."
