  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the category 'row,' indicating that a rowing machine is essential. The workout name 'Every Stroke Matters Row' and the description emphasizing power, endurance, and speed further suggest the focus is on rowing, which typically requires a rowing machine. The metadata lacks any alternative equipment suggestions, reinforcing that the primary equipment needed is indeed a rowing machine, with very high confidence (1.0). The image also depicts rowing activity, supporting this interpretation."
