  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the on-water rowing setting, which helps leverage natural terrain and environmental challenges, scoring a high 0.8 for this attribute. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is evident from the pacing max rhythm of 30, dance, and global hits music intended to create a smooth, continuous flow, which aligns with a score of 0.7. Although the workout is described as a warm-up, it follows an 'interval' format, indicating a structured approach, leading to a score of 0.6 in the 'Structured & Disciplined' category. The brief nature and the warm-up designation create some ambiguity but help ensure the workout remains focused without the intensity needed to classify it as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility.' The primary focus is on preparing the body with a rhythmic and controlled approach, suitable for warm-ups."
