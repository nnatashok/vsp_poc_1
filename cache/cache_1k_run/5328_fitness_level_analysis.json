  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as 'drive', which according to Hydrow's specific rule should be classified under the 'Advanced' technique category. However, given it is a rowing workout, the highest possible classification is 'Intermediate'. The HIIT format suggests a need for some coordination and familiarity with rowing technique but not overly complex movements. Thus, 'Intermediate' is suitable for this category.",
