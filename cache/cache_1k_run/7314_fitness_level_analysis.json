  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row,' which limits technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate levels. The format 'Climb' suggests a progression in effort rather than complexity, aligning with general rowing form which remains simple. Thus, 'Beginner' technique with a score of 0.85 is dominant due to the straightforward nature of rowing. There's a moderate case for 'Intermediate' due to interval structure, but core movements remain simple.",
