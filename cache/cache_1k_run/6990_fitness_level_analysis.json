  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive', which typically implies a focus on more advanced rowing technique with higher intensity, aligning strongly with Intermediate to Advanced technique requirements. Row workouts generally fall under Beginner to Intermediate technique level, but the 'Drive' tag indicates a more skillful and technically challenging session. The intervals featuring high rhythms demand moderate precision, coordination, and technique, fitting the Intermediate to Advanced category.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Effort difficulty is high due to the workout's intensity level indicated as 3 out of 3, and the fact that this is an interval-based session which normally increases intensity. The session features short, high-rhythm bursts which are demanding, supported by motivational and fast-paced music, making it extremely demanding. For less fit users, this would require significant exertion, hence the score of 0.85 for Extreme effort.",
