  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Instructional: Perfect Your Posture' emphasizes posture improvement, which suggests a focus on body alignment and foundational exercises rather than intensive activity. The description mentions 'sitting tall', typically associated with exercises targeting core strength and posture, often found in Mat workouts. The playlist includes pop songs which could complement a relaxed yet focused session, hinting at stretching or balance routines. The metadata specifies 'warm-up' which is often lower intensity and can include stretching or gentle rowing. Despite being labeled as 'row' in the category, the absence of explicit rowing machine details and the instructional aspect lead to classifying it partly as 'Indoor rowing' minimally. Overall, 'Mat' seems most fitting due to the instructional nature focused on posture and core engagement, 'Stretching' is included for the posture focus, and 'Indoor rowing' considered lightly due to potential rowing context. Confidence is moderate due to limited explicit indicators."
