  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a short duration of 10:49 and emphasis on alignment and tension release, the workout is likely low intensity. The music selection contributes to a setting that suggests relaxation rather than strenuous activity. Hence, it requires minimal energy expenditure, aligning most strongly with 'Light', though some engagement could place it weakly in 'Moderate'.",
