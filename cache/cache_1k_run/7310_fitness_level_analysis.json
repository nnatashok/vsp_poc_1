  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "At 10 minutes and 49 seconds, this workout is short and likely not demanding in terms of physical exertion. The 'align' type typically involves flexibility and relaxation exercises rather than intense physical activity, further suggested by the calm and downtempo music choice. Given the post-row recovery focus, energy expenditure should be low, aligning well with beginner-level effort requirements.",
