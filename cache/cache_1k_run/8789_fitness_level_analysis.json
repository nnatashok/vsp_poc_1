  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' which typically suggests simple movements. The beginner-friendly description and low-intensity level (1 out of 3) reinforces the minimal complexity, suitable for those new to rowing. The maximum rhythm of 24 further supports a steady and manageable pace, aligning with beginner levels. Minor inference to intermediate arises due to the endurance-building aspect, though primary cues favor beginner alignment.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of approximately 21 minutes and the low intensity level (1 out of 3) suggest low physical demand. Described as a 'breathe' session aiming to build endurance with consistent effort, it indicates lower energy expenditure common in light workouts. The pyramid format could slightly increase effort but not beyond light for beginners. Therefore, the effort difficulty is primarily light with a weak potential for moderate intensity due to pyramid structure.",
