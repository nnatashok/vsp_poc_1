  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically denotes simpler technique requirements. The use of 'shift up in rhythm' might introduce a bit of complexity but is still within the boundaries of possible variations for a rowing workout. The absence of complex moves such as compound lifts or advanced coordination exercises in the description aligns closely with beginner-level technique. However, the gradual rhythm increase suggests some coordination skills typical for an intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 16 minutes and an 'intensity level' of 2 out of 3, the workout promises to be somewhat physically demanding without reaching the highest exertion level. The 'sweat' category typically involves increased cardio and muscular work, while the climbing rhythm to a max of 28 suggests constant physical engagement. As it is a 'fast run pace,' moderately fit individuals might find it challenging, aligning with moderate effort difficulty, but there are elements of a more challenging workout due to intensity cues.",
