  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically classifies the technique difficulty as either Beginner or Intermediate. With a format of 'Climb' and a focus on rhythm increasing each minute, it suggests that maintaining proper form at higher stroke rates might require some coordination, thus aligning strongly with 'Intermediate'. Even with this in mind, the fundamental rowing movement remains relatively simple for those familiar with rowing basics, so there is also moderate alignment with 'Beginner'.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as a 'sweat' type with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicating significant physical effort. The duration of 16:31 minutes, combined with a focus on gradually increasing rhythm to a max of 28, implies that the workout requires a fair amount of sustained energy expenditure. While not overly long, the increase in rhythm and intensity makes it challenging for deconditioned users. Therefore, it strongly aligns with 'Moderate' effort and also aligns moderately with 'Challenging'.",
