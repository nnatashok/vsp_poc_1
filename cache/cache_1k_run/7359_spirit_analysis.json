  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's title 'Steady State Row' and description emphasize a 'steady' pacing with rhythms 22 and 24, indicating a continuous and smooth exercise pattern, which aligns well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The use of rock and roll music further enhances the rhythmic flow. The workout's characterization as 'steady' and the low-intensity level support this classification, receiving a strong score of 0.75.\n\nThe outdoor rowing setting shown in the image, with natural surroundings and a river, clearly fits the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The presence of real-world rowing in this environment, along with the classification as a 'breathe' session in the 'Category,' complements this spirit, justifying a slightly stronger score of 0.8.\n\nThe structured and soothing elements are less prominent due to the moderate tempo and the external environment. Hence, other spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are not emphasized here."
