  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'The Masterclass Workout' and 'The Groove Session' based on the following evidence:\n\n1. **The Masterclass Workout (Score: 0.8):** The advanced level and focus on Pilates suggest a technique-driven, focused, and skill-building session. The description emphasizes a more challenging pace suitable for experienced practitioners, aligning well with the precision and mastery elements of this vibe.\n\n2. **The Groove Session (Score: 0.7):** The playlist features upbeat and popular music tracks such as 'Big Energy' by Latto and 'About Damn Time' by Lizzo, suggesting a fun, fluid, and expressive environment. Despite being a Pilates workout, the music adds a lively and engaging dimension, fitting the Groove Session vibe.\n\nThe absence of a specified music genre initially, and the use of a variety of mainstream pop songs, indicate elements of musical enjoyment and rhythm, supporting the chosen vibes. The fast-paced nature also contributes to the Groove Session element, while the advanced Pilates aspect is primarily responsible for the strong Masterclass identification."
