  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Human Body Facts Row' seems to embody a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the smooth, continuous nature implied by the 'Max rhythm: 30' and the music playlist featuring artists known for dynamic and rhythmic tracks (e.g., Gorgon City, Disclosure). The use of songs categorized as 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' further suggests a rhythm-driven experience.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is strongly indicated by the image showing rowing on a river, which, combined with the intervals and on-water setting, reflects nature-based exploration. This setting enhances the adventurous and explorative quality of the workout.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit was considered but not selected, as the intensity level is moderate (2 out of 3), which suggests a balanced effort rather than constant high intensity. The creative sharing of human body facts could contribute to maintaining mental engagement, fitting well within a 'Flow & Rhythm' or exploratory 'Outdoor & Adventure' session."
