  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the categories 'Breathe' and 'row' with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, suggesting a focus on relaxation and smooth rowing rather than complex movements. Rowing activities, within this platform, are generally categorized as either Beginner or Intermediate in terms of technique difficulty due to the simple, repetitive nature of rowing motions. The absence of any technical instructions or complex movement descriptions supports a predominant Beginner classification with 0.8 confidence, though the 'Climb' format may introduce slight complexity justifying a minor consideration for Intermediate.",
