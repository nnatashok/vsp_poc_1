  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized by a quick and efficient Pilates session focusing on the core, suggesting a technique-driven, focused approach typical of 'The Masterclass Workout' (Score: 0.7). The description emphasizes 'ignite your core,' aligning with skill-building and technique refinement. The music playlist, featuring hip hop and global hits, infuses an element of fun and rhythm, adding a layer of 'The Groove Session' (Score: 0.5), which is about flow and enjoyment. The short duration of 5 minutes and 40 seconds also emphasizes a quick, focused session, rather than a longer, endurance-based vibe. While 'The Groove Session' doesn't fully match the core focus, there's enough rhythmic influence to consider it a secondary vibe. The confidence is moderately high at 0.75 due to clear indicators from the workout type and music."
