  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Masterclass Workout' due to the focus on 'classical pilates', indicating a technique-driven, skill-building session (score 0.7). Pilates is often technique-focused, and the use of the term 'classical' further emphasizes this. The 'Zen Flow' vibe is also relevant, as pilates typically involves grounding and intentional movement, aligning with the calm nature suggested by the setting in 'beautiful view of Tuscany' (score 0.6). The outdoor setting in Tuscany contributes to the 'Nature Flow' vibe, highlighting breath-centered, full-body outdoor rhythm (score 0.5). The playlist, while not clearly defining the vibe, suggests a lack of intense or upbeat music, which aligns more with these calming, technique-driven vibes."
