  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which restricts the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate levels. The core activity, rowing, involves repetitive, low-complexity movements that primarily require maintaining a consistent stroke form. Given the workout intensity level of 2 out of 3 and a focus on varying rhythms, there is an element of coordination involved, slightly edging towards the Intermediate level. However, overall, the movement complexity remains low, justifying a high score for Beginner.",
