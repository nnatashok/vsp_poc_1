  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The user's fitness level requirement is Intermediate, indicating that the Technique Difficulty should align. Given the workout type is 'row', this aligns with either Beginner or Intermediate. The workout description includes moderate complexity elements like controlling rhythm and adjusting power, supporting a Beginner to Intermediate rating. However, considering the 11-minute duration and rhythm control aspects, the alignment skews slightly towards Beginner with a moderate Intermediate component due to rhythm variation.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, tagged as 'sweat' and 'Power' with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicates a moderate energy exertion rather than light. The short duration (11 minutes and 19 seconds) prevents it from being highly demanding physically, lending to a Moderate classification. The effort required to maintain control over rhythm variation can elevate energy expenditure slightly beyond Light but does not reach Challenging or Extreme due to the brevity of the workout.",
