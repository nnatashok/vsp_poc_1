  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is categorized as 'row', and the description emphasizes a gentle climb with rhythm, which suggests simple rowing techniques focused on maintaining a pace rather than complex movements. 'Row' as a category typically involves repetitive, low-complexity motions, consistent with a Beginner technique level. The additional mention of rhythm may suggest a slight need for coordination, but not enough to significantly increase the difficulty to Intermediate. Therefore, Beginner is assessed with a score of 0.95, with some alignment towards Intermediate with a score of 0.05.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 21 minutes, which suggests a relatively brief session. The intensity level is 1 out of 3, indicating that this session is not designed to be highly strenuous. The format, 'Interval', suggests varied intensity but within a rhythmic and gentle setting as described. This matches well with a 'Light' effort difficulty, as it aligns with low energy expenditure expectations suitable for beginners. However, the nature of the interval format could introduce slight moderate efforts, which adds a small presence of 'Moderate' at 0.1.",
