  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which means by Hydrow-specific rules, the Technique Difficulty defaults to be either Beginner or Intermediate. The use of simple rhythms (20 and 24) and emphasis on breathing and relaxation indicates simplicity suitable for beginners. Therefore, I have assigned a high score to Beginner, with a slight acknowledgment that maintaining rhythm might require some coordination, giving Intermediate a low score.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'breathe' format with an intensity level of 1 out of 3. The interval format with a duration of 31 minutes can be somewhat challenging, but given the relaxed nature focusing on breathing, it leans towards Low to Moderate energy expenditure. Hence, I have allocated the scores with more weight on the Light difficulty with some consideration for Moderate.",
