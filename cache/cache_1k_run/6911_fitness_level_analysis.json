  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is only 5 minutes and 40 seconds long, indicating low duration. Pilates generally focuses on controlled, low-impact movements, which often results in a lower energy expenditure and is less intense compared to other workouts like HIIT or circuit training. The short duration and its positioning as 'perfect for after any row' further reduce intensity, indicating it is designed for a low-energy use, restorative session.",
