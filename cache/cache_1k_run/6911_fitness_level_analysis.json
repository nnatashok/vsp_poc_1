  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "At just 5 minutes and 40 seconds long, this Pilates workout is brief, contributing to a low energy expenditure. The non-intense nature of Pilates paired with the short duration makes the workout 'Light' in Effort Difficulty. However, some moderate level edge is warranted due to the muscle focus, albeit minimal. Therefore, the primary alignment is 'Light'.",
