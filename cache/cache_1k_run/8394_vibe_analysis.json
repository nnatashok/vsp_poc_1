  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is designated as 'align' and focuses specifically on movement and strength in the feet and ankles, suggesting a slow, intentional practice suited for The Zen Flow vibe. This is further supported by the description of overlooking the Boston Harbor, which contributes to a calming and grounding environment. The music played is categorized as 'chill low' and 'cool/downtempo,' reinforcing a relaxing and breath-centered experience. Hence, The Zen Flow is a strong match with a score of 0.8. \n\nAdditionally, since the workout is meant to enhance mobility and strength in specific areas (feet and ankles) for a short duration, it aligns with The Reboot Workout vibe, emphasizing low stress and total-body refreshment, earning a score of 0.7. Other potential vibes such as The Meditative Grind or The Groove Session were considered but didn't quite fit due to the specific focus on body parts and the calming music choice."
