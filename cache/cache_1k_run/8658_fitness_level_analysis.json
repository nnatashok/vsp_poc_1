  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is classified as 'drive,' which according to Hydrow's specific rules should be considered Advanced due to its technical rowing elements and coordination requirements. The 'HIIT' format and 'Drive' category further support a higher classification on the technique difficulty scale, as they suggest complex rowing tasks that require good body awareness and coordination. This content is not classified under the simple rowing categories, confirming its advanced nature.",
