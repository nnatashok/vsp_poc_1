  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Bodyweight Strength' and described as targeting core and lower body with a series of exercises, indicating it's likely bodyweight-focused. The category \"On The Mat\" strongly implies the use of a mat. Additionally, the image shows individuals using mats, further supporting the need for this equipment. Since mats are specifically suited for on-the-floor exercises and provide comfort and support, a very high confidence score of 0.9 is given for mats being required equipment."
