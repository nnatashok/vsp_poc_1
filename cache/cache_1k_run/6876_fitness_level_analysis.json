  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is rowing-based, classified as 'breathe', which indicates a focus on rhythm and breathing. The technique for rowing typically doesn't exceed intermediate difficulty. The interval format might require some coordination, but given the 'breathe' type and explicit 'beginner' user fitness level requirement, it suggests a low complexity. Thus, it strongly aligns with Beginner and moderately with Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is relatively short at 11 minutes and 33 seconds, and with an intensity level rated 1 out of 3, it indicates a light to moderately demanding physical requirement. The 'breathe' format suggests controlled effort, suitable for less demanding intensity, hence a stronger alignment with Light and moderate with Moderate.",
