  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is over 20 minutes with a circuit format, featuring exercises both on and off the Hydrow. The EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute) format implies continuous activity with minimal rest, increasing cardiovascular and muscular demand. This, along with the instructor's high-energy CrossFit background, suggests significant physical effort. The variety of exercises and use of dumbbells indicates a substantial energy expenditure, pushing effort difficulty to moderate while also being challenging, especially for beginners or those with lower fitness levels.",
