  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is just under 21 minutes and it involves a 'faster paced power flow', suggesting a consistent activity level throughout, introducing moderate cardio and strength work. While yoga typically doesn't involve high energy expenditure, the flowing style and pace elevate it above light effort. Chill and downtempo music may somewhat dampen perceived intensity, fitting it best into a Moderate effort level enclave, suitable for somewhat deconditioned individuals.",
