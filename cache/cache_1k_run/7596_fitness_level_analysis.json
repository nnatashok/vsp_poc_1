  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which allows for only Beginner or Intermediate levels of technique difficulty. Given the description of the intervals being at a 'steady pace', and the simplicity typically associated with rowing, it aligns with a Beginner level. The absence of complex movements or high coordination demands in the description supports this classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a workout duration of just over 21 minutes and an intensity level marked as 1 out of 3, this workout is primarily suited for Light effort difficulty. The session consists of multiple short intervals which might introduce a moderate component. However, given the steady pace and the breathe type focusing on a more relaxed effort, it aligns more strongly with Light, but Moderate is possible for slightly deconditioned users.",
