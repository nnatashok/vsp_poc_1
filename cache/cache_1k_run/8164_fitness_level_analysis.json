  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the short duration (15 minutes and 45 seconds), the energy expenditure for this workout is expected to be moderate. The use of mini bands can increase resistance, hence increasing the effort required without making it overly intense. The music choice, aligned with genres like Dance and Global Hits, implies a steady, motivating rhythm, which further complements a moderate pace rather than an intense one. Therefore, the workout is likely between Light to Moderate effort, leaning more towards Moderate due to the inclusion of resistance bands and the focus on strength, even if lower body-focused and short in duration.",
