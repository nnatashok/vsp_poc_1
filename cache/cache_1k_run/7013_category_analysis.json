  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary evidence strongly indicates an 'Indoor rowing' classification for this workout. The workout name 'Face Your Fears Row' and description explicitly mention rowing ('as Aisyah leads you through intervals climbing in rhythm'), suggesting the use of a rowing machine. The mention of 'intervals' and 'rhythm' combined with a workout formatted as 'sweat' and the category 'row' confirm it is a rowing-specific session. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 further supports this as a vigorous but manageable indoor rowing workout. Therefore, 'Indoor rowing' receives a score of 0.9 due to its central presence as the defining feature. Other categories like 'HIIT' or 'Mat' are excluded due to lack of evidence related to non-rowing exercises."
