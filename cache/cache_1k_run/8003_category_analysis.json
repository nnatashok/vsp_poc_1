  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is titled 'Beginner Flow,' which typically refers to a type of yoga practice. The description explicitly mentions 'yoga flow,' which strongly indicates that the workout is a Yoga session. The category tags also include 'On The Mat,' which is consistent with mat-based Yoga sessions. The description suggests a flow that builds heat, characteristic of a dynamic Yoga session suitable for all levels. The absence of specific mention of stretching, meditation, or other activities outside of Yoga strengthens the classification. Therefore, Yoga is chosen with a high confidence score of 0.8 due to the clear and explicit indicators in the title and description."
