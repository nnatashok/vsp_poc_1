  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row,' which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. Although it's a cool-down focusing on technique, the presence of the 'row' category suggests that the rowing machine is central to the workout, warranting a very high confidence level (1.0). The description does not mention any other specific equipment, and the cool-down setting likely follows the primary rowing workout, reinforcing the need for a rowing machine."
