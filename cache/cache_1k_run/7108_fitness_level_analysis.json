  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is only 10 minutes and 52 seconds long, classified as a warm-up with an emphasis on mental and physical preparation. This indicates a focus on lighter exertion to raise the heart rate without significant fatigue. Although it mentions 'quick and powerful strokes', the very short duration and warm-up context suggest light to moderate physical demand, suitable for beginners yet slightly challenging.",
