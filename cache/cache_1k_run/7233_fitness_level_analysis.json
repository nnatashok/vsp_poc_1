  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a stretch session post-rowing, specifically targeting hips and glutes which are generally low-intensity and suitable for recovery purposes. The short duration of 5 minutes and 41 seconds also indicates a very light physical demand, with no evidence of intense or prolonged activity. Thus, the effort difficulty remains light, making it accessible for less fit users.",
