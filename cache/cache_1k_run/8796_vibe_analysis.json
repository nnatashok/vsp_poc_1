  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is assigned as 'The Foundation Builder' due to its focus on bodyweight exercises for beginners, emphasizing starting at an appropriate level and progressively strengthening weak points. The mention of 'Beginner whole body focus' and the format intended for those working on foundational fitness supports this categorization, earning it a score of 0.7. \n\n'Progression Quest' is chosen due to the structured, incremental approach represented by the 90-second intervals and EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute) format. This methodical training approach is indicative of a progressive improvement goal, given a score of 0.6.\n\n'The Disciplined Grind' is also relevant, considering the Marine veteran's coaching style, which suggests a rigorous and focused workout experience. This influence provides a disciplined, no-excuses atmosphere that aligns with the 'Disciplined Grind', scored at 0.5 due to its implied but not overtly emphasized characteristics in the metadata.\n\nThe energetic coaching style and EMOM format slightly suggest 'The Warrior Workout', but this isn't chosen due to the beginner-friendly nature, which tempers the intensity closer to foundational and progression-focused aspects."
