  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout 'Walk the Plank Row' is categorized under 'row,' which aligns with Hydrow's rowing workout rule. This limits the Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The emphasis on 'Drive harrrrrd' suggests a focus on rhythm and leg drive, skills that beginners can grasp with some practice. Since no complex movements are indicated, the classification predominantly aligns with Beginner (90% confidence), with a slight consideration for Intermediate due to the interval format.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 21 minutes and 38 seconds and the interval format suggest a higher effort expenditure compared to continuous rowing. The workout intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicates it's suited for participants with some fitness background but not excessive exertion. The use of terms like 'Drive harrrrrd' and a max rhythm of 30 supports a moderate difficulty classification (75% confidence). Given the interval format, there's also a slight alignment with Challenging (25% score), indicating periods requiring more effort.",
