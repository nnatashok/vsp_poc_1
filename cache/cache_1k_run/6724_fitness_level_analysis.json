  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short 5-minute 47-second warm-up with intervals at a lowered rhythm (max rhythm 24), typically resulting in a Light effort. The format 'Reverse Climb' might hint at brief moments requiring a bit more engagement, justifying a minor inclusion of Moderate effort. However, the short duration and purpose as a warm-up suggest primarily Light effort demands.",
