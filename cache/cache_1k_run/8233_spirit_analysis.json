  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Family Connection Row' is primarily classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.9 due to its rowing setting, which is clearly depicted in the image as being outdoors on a river. This aligns strongly with the spirit that leverages natural terrain and environmental elements.\n\nAdditionally, the workout has a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.75. The keywords 'discover your foundations of speed and power' and 'various rhythms' suggest a methodical approach to achieving specific fitness outcomes, supported by the structure of interval training. The format of 'intervals' and the inclusion in categories such as 'standard row' further emphasize this disciplined training aspect.\n\nAlthough the workout is listed under the 'sweat' category with a max rhythm of 34, the overall intensity level of 2 out of 3 and the intervals approach indicate a more structured than purely high-energy session, thus directing the primary classification more towards discipline and outdoor engagement."
