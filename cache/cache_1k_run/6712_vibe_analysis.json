  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily identified as 'Core Pilates,' which is technique-focused and aims to strengthen the core, aligning well with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe. The use of specific instructors from Lucerne suggests a potentially skill-focused session. This is supported by pilates being a methodical exercise form. The duration of around 11 minutes suggests a focused and efficient session rather than an intense one, thus fitting 'The Reboot Workout' to some extent due to its likely refreshing and restorative nature. The moderate hip-hop and global hits playlist adds an unusual dynamic to the typically calming pilates, indicating possible motivation rather than relaxation. This slightly fits 'The Reboot Workout,' providing a refreshing twist."
