  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Drive', which according to Hydrow-specific rules, should be considered Advanced in technique difficulty. The workout emphasizes high-intensity intervals and focuses on achieving proper form with splits, implying a need for good rowing technique. While rowing itself may often be Beginner to Intermediate, the 'Drive' categorization and focus on specific performance metrics (split) elevate the technique difficulty to Advanced.",

The 'intensity level: 3 out of 3' suggests extreme effort is required. The workout's short duration of 11:19 with high-intensity intervals further supports the high-effort classification, as it suggests little rest and high energy expenditure throughout the session.",
