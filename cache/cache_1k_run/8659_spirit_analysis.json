  "spiritsExplanation": "The title, 'Hamstring Stretch,' and the description focusing on flexibility suggest a primary emphasis on relaxation and recovery. The use of phrases like 'simple, hamstring stretches' and 'resistance band, strap, or towel required' indicates the session is gentle and aimed at improving body flexibility, which are characteristics aligned with a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. Therefore, this spirit is scored at 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, the image provided shows the workout being conducted outdoors with a cityscape view, suggesting an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. While the workout is primarily focused on stretching, the setting adds an outdoor element, enhancing the connection with nature. This spirit is scored at 0.7 because the outdoor setting is secondary to the stretching focus.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the lack of intensity and performance-based elements, which are not evident in the metadata or image."
