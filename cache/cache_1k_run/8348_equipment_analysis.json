  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'High Energy HIIT Row' and has a category designation that includes 'row,' which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. The phrase '45-second intervals' along with the HIIT format indicates a structured rowing exercise that typically requires a rowing machine for indoor workouts. Additionally, the image provided shows an outdoor rowing scenario, but the mention of rowing in the context most likely requires an indoor rowing machine for viewers to follow in a similar manner. Therefore, the confidence score for needing a rowing machine is very high at 0.9."
