  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit due to its focus on specific exercises targeting the abductors and adductors, indicating a methodical and progressive approach to strength training. This aligns with the category 'On The Mat' which often implies disciplined floor exercises. The use of the phrase 'strengthen your abductors and adductors' in the description supports this classification.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is applicable due to the visual evidence of an outdoor setting in a snowy environment, providing an adventurous and environmental element to the workout. The celebratory St. Patrick's Day theme adds a unique twist to the typical outdoor settings, supporting the adventurous aspect. The user is performing the workout in nature, enhancing this spirit classification. \n\nWhile the location suggests potential for 'Soothing & Restorative', the primary focus on structured strength exercises reduces this option's relevance."
