  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is relatively short at about 21 minutes with a focus on flowing yoga poses, described as 'Gently move your body'. This suggests low intensity and low energy consumption, which aligns with a light effort difficulty. The presence of continuous flow can hint at slight moderate effort, but without high energy expenditure or intense movement, the primary classification remains light.",
