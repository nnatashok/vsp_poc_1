  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of approximately 21 minutes and the description of 'gently move your body' suggest a light to moderate energy expenditure. The chill and downtempo music further points towards a relaxed pace, typical for gentle yoga flows. Consequently, the effort difficulty is primarily Light, with a moderate consideration for some Moderate elements based on potential longer hold durations in poses.",
