  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout title \"Climbing Intervals Row\" and the description specifying \"intervals on the Charles River\" clearly indicate an \"Indoor rowing\" workout. The naming of specific intervals, rhythm, and format as \"Climb\" aligns with structured interval rowing sessions. The workout's intensity level is 2 out of 3, suggesting substantial activity, consistent with interval rowing's high-intensity demands. Despite not explicitly mentioning a rowing machine, the context and references to \"Sweat, standard, row\" categorically link this to rowing workouts. Other potential categories such as \"HIIT\" could have been considered due to the interval nature but are excluded due to the clear emphasis on rowing. The very high confidence stems from the explicit language and context supporting an indoor rowing focus."
