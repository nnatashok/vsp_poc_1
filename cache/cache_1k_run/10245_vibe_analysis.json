  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified for this workout is \"The Competitor,\" with a score of 0.9, indicating a very strong match. This is supported by the workout's focus on mimicking a 5,000-meter race and the use of max pressure intervals to enhance strategy and performance, which aligns closely with competitive, race-oriented training. Additionally, the mention of visualizations and strategic sharpening reflects the competitive nature of the session. The secondary vibe is \"The Endorphin Wave,\" scoring 0.7, supported by the workout's format of building endurance through powerful and rhythmic strokes, designed to invoke an elevated, feel-good energy typical of endurance sessions aimed at achieving peak performance. Lastly, \"The Meditative Grind\" scores 0.6 due to the repetitive, endurance-building nature of the high-rhythm start and interval structure, encouraging focus and momentum through sustained effort. The absence of specific music genre information but with pop and global hits radio hints toward a broader, engaging experience rather than a specific nightclub vibe."
