  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Yoga For Runners' and the category 'On The Mat' indicates that a mat is essential. Additionally, the image shows participants using mats, confirming their necessity. There are blocks visible in the image, which suggests they are used to aid in positioning or support during the yoga session. Thus, both the mat and blocks are identified with very high confidence."
