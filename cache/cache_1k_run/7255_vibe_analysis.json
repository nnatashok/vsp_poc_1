  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled \"Technique Cool-Down\" is clearly focused on reinforcing technique while cooling down, as evident in the title and description. This points towards \"The Masterclass Workout\" due to its emphasis on skill-building and technique refinement, scoring a 0.7. The metadata indicating a cool-down phase and the use of downtempo, jazz, and blues music aligns well with \"The Reboot Workout,\" scoring 0.8, as it suggests a relaxed pace and recovery focus. The calming nature of cool-downs and the music style also fits \"The Zen Flow\" vibe as it suggests a grounding and breath-centered experience, earning it a 0.6 score. The absence of high-intensity or competition elements excludes vibes like \"The Competitor\" or \"The Warrior Workout.\" The high confidence level of 0.85 is due to specific indicators in the title and music style corresponding with the assigned vibes."
