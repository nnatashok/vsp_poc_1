  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified with high confidence as 'Indoor rowing' and 'Stretching'. The title 'Pause Drills Cool-Down' and description 'Take easy strokes with Mac while you reinforce good technique during pause drills' strongly suggest it's an indoor rowing workout focused on technique and cool-down, evidenced by the terminology 'strokes' commonly associated with rowing. The described intensity as 'max rhythm: 20' supports that it's a light rowing session rather than a high-intensity or competitive one. The 'cool down' in the title and description also justifies a secondary 'Stretching' category, indicating a focus on slower, technique-focused, and potentially flexibility-improving movements typical of a cool-down session. The absence of high-intensity tags or descriptions and the presence of relaxing pop music further align with a cool-down vibe."
