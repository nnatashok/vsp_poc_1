  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily focused on releasing tension and improving flexibility, which aligns closely with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The simple stretching exercises for the back, as stated in the metadata, emphasize recovery and relaxation, justifying a high score of 0.9 for this spirit. The description contains phrases like 'release tension,' 'gain flexibility,' and 'simple stretches,' which are indicative of this classification.\n\nAdditionally, the workout takes place outdoors, as evidenced by the image showing instructors on mats near a river. This setting suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, although the workout's primary focus isn't on exploration or environmental challenges. Therefore, 'Outdoor & Adventure' receives a supporting score of 0.6.\n\nMusic being pop and global hits plays a minor role but does not strongly influence the spirit classification, focusing primarily on relaxation rather than high energy or structured discipline."
