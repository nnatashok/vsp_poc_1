  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'On The Mat,' which indicates the necessity of a mat for performing the exercises comfortably and safely on the floor. This is further supported by the workout description focusing on core exercises, typically performed on a mat to provide cushioning and support. The high confidence is also backed by the accompanying image where a mat is clearly visible and being used during the workout. The presence of a mat is central to the workout's designation and content."
