  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Lower Body Circuit' features a structured circuit format that includes dumbbell exercises and intervals, aligning it with a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to the mention of feeling the burn and the involvement of intervals, indicative of a more vigorous workout (score: 0.7). The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is relevant due to the circuit-based approach, which suggests a methodical organization and progression through exercises (score: 0.6). Additionally, the mention of a max rhythm and use of music like Pop mid and Global Hits hint at elements of 'Flow & Rhythm', suggesting a connection to pacing and coordination during the session (score: 0.5). The absence of outdoor or sports-specific elements excludes spirits like 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Sport & Agility' from consideration."
