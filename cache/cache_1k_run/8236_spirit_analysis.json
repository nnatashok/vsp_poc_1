  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'The Kids' Table Row' is conducted on the Charles River, as indicated by the description mentioning 'Thanksgiving-themed workout on the Charles.' This outdoor setting strongly suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.9). The activity takes place in nature, leveraging the natural environment for the rowing session.\n\nThe mention of 'Intervals' and 'Max rhythm: 32' suggests an element of pacing and coordination, which aligns with a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.6). The playlist consisting of upbeat pop and hits like 'Love Shack' and 'Burning Love' supports a rhythmic and engaging atmosphere within the workout, enhancing the mind-body connection.\n\nThe intensity level '2 out of 3' and format 'sweat' indicate moderate intensity, but combined with the rowing on a river, it doesn't fully embody the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, which is why this is not selected. The absence of extremely competitive or detailed instructions excludes 'Structured & Disciplined.'"
