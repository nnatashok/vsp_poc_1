  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as a 'steady state row' with rhythms between 20 to 22, which are not considered technically challenging for rowing. This is supported by the workout category 'breathe', indicating a focus on steady, less aggressive rowing. Given these factors and the classification rules for 'row' workouts, this aligns strongly with a Beginner technique difficulty, with some possibility of being Intermediate due to the rhythm.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 11:21 at a 'steady state' rowing with classifications like breathe and an intensity level of '1 out of 3'. These factors suggest low energy expenditure and effort. The rhythm and pace implied by the workout description further reinforce this being appropriate for a Light effort level, with some alignment towards Moderate due to the continuous nature of rowing.",
