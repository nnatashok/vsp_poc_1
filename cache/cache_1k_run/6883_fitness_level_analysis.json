  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The Technique Difficulty for this workout is primarily Intermediate due to the nature of rowing exercises, which, as per Hydrow-specific rules, generally fall under Beginner or Intermediate. The use of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) introduces a component that may require slightly more skill and body control, hence a smaller score is given to Advanced.",

The workout includes 30, 45, and 60-second intervals at a max rhythm of 32, which suggests high cardiovascular demand. The duration of 11:31 suggests a compact but rigorous session, indicative of Challenging, potentially bordering on Extreme for less fit users, especially given the intensity level of 3 out of 3.",
