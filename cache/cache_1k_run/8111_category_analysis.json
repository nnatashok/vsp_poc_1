  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'HIIT Pyramid Row' which strongly suggests both an indoor rowing component and a High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) format. The description mentions 'high-intensity intervals at high rhythms' further confirming the HIIT classification. The use of the term 'row' and the fact that the workout involves 'dodging icebergs' points towards a rowing activity, likely performed on a rowing machine. The playlist with energetic and motivating songs, alongside the described maximum rhythm of 34, supports this categorization as it aligns with typical HIIT and rowing music to maintain intensity. The 'drive' and intensity level '3 out of 3' additionally corroborate the high-intensity nature of the workout, typical for HIIT. Alternative categories like 'Elliptical' or 'Mat' were excluded as there is no indication of elliptical equipment or mat-based exercises."
