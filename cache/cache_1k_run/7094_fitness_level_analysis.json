Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is very short, at only 1 minute and 42 seconds, which typically limits the physical demand and thus falls into the 'Light' effort difficulty category. Pilates generally provides a low-impact workout, and the specific focus on 'back extension' implies a controlled pace with a focus on form over intensity. Given the short duration and the 'keep moving for the minute' phrasing, there is a very light intensity implied with just a slight possibility of being moderately challenging due to the tempo of the exercises.",
