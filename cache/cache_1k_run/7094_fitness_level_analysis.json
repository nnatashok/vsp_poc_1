  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is very brief (1 minute 42 seconds), minimizing the overall physical demand. The term 'Keep moving for the minute' implies constant but not necessarily high-intensity movement, indicating it\u2019s accessible to users even with lower fitness levels. Pilates exercises typically focus on strength rather than cardio, which aligns with Light effort difficulty (score 0.8). However, given the challenge aspect, it might still engage muscles, so there is moderate alignment with Moderate effort difficulty (score 0.5).",
