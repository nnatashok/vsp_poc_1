  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as \"High-Energy & Intense\" with a score of 0.9 due to the metadata indicating a high-intensity session. Terms like \"race off at high rhythms\" and \"accumulate maximum meters\" suggest a focus on speed and endurance at a maximum rhythm of 34, which aligns with intense and vigorous efforts. The intensity level of 3 out of 3 further supports this spirit.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is assigned a score of 0.7, as the visual data shows rowing taking place on a river with natural surroundings, fitting the theme of environmental challenge and exploration.\n\nFinally, \"Flow & Rhythm\" receives a score of 0.5. While the primary focus is intensity, the mention of \"high rhythms\" and the music list, featuring energetic and rhythmic pop songs, suggest elements of a coordinated, music-driven experience.\n\nOther spirits like \"Soothing & Restorative\" and \"Structured & Disciplined\" are excluded due to lack of recovery focus and explicit training protocols. \"Sport & Agility\" is also less relevant in this context."
