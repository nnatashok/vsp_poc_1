  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'row', which defaults the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. 'Endurance Intervals Row' suggests straightforward rowing patterns with rhythmic changes, aligning well with a Beginner rating. However, the 'Interval' format, with climbing intervals and a max rhythm of 28, introduces a moderate level of complexity, supporting an Intermediate rating. Therefore, both Beginner and Intermediate levels are applicable, with a stronger lean towards Beginner due to the simplicity of rowing movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout description characterizes the intensity level as 2 out of 3, aligning with Moderate to Challenging effort. The 16-minute duration of 'Endurance Intervals Row' and inclusion of interval training imply a steady energy demand. Rock and global hits apps might increase tempo perception, marginally raising intensity. Climbing intervals require effort but likely sustainability for Intermediate-level users, affirming both Moderate and Challenging designations, with greater emphasis on Moderate.",
