  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'row' category with interval format, suggesting some complexity, but as it's rowing-focused, the technique remains within 'Beginner' to 'Intermediate'. The max rhythm of 28 hints at higher coordination, aligning with 'Intermediate'. However, given the rowing-specific technique simplification, both Beginner (0.8) and Intermediate (0.7) are fitting scores.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The interval format (climbing intervals over 16 minutes) requires sustained effort, and with a max rhythm of 28, this suggests significant engagement and energy expenditure, leading to a 'Challenging' (0.7) classification. However, the stated effort level of 2 out of 3 supports a 'Moderate' effort as well, resulting in a combined score assessment. The short duration (16:15) tempers the total exertion level, justifying both ratings.",
