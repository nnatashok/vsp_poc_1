Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 21 minutes and the label 'power flow' indicate medium intensity, suitable for moderate effort. The workout aims to energize, potentially incorporating dynamic movements that raise heart rates to a manageable degree. The playlist with 'Chill mid' and 'Cool/Downtempo' music further supports a sustained yet moderate effort level, so Moderate effort difficulty is rated at 0.8 due to the dynamic nature implied by 'power flow.'",
