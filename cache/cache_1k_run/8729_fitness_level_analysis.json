  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically involves movements that are either Beginner or Intermediate in nature. The term 'pyramids' suggests some variation in intensity or speed, but the overall activity remains rowing-focused and does not require complex movements. Therefore, the technique difficulty aligns strongly with the Beginner level (score: 0.8) due to the simple, repetitive nature of rowing movements, with a slight consideration for Intermediate (score: 0.2) due to potential coordination needed with changes in rhythm during pyramids.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is 21:15, which is relatively short, and the intensity level is listed as 1 out of 3, suggesting a focus on being more gentle and less demanding. As a 'breathe' workout, it emphasizes endurance at a manageable pace rather than high intensity. Therefore, the effort difficulty is primarily Light (score: 0.8), suitable for beginners and those of low fitness, with a slight possibility of being Moderate (score: 0.2) due to varying rhythm in pyramid sets which might increase the overall demand slightly.",
