  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type specified is 'breathe', which typically indicates a focus on steady, controlled rowing, suitable for beginners. The metadata categorizes the workout as 'row', and based on Hydrow guidelines, this aligns with a Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty. The format 'pyramid' may introduce minor additional complexity due to varying intensity but remains within the Beginner scope given the overall classification and lack of complex movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 21 minutes, this workout offers manageable length for beginners, and a 'breathe' workout is generally low in physical intensity, indicated further by a max rhythm of 26. The intensity level is marked as 1 out of 3, implying light to moderate effort. The music genre choice and instructor absence support a more relaxed, self-paced approach, suitable for users requiring gentle cardiovascular activity, thus favoring a Light effort classification, though potentially shifting into Moderate at points due to the 'pyramid' structure.",
