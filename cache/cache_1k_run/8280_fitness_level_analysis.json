Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This cool-down session lasting under 6 minutes inherently indicates a low-energy expenditure, especially being a cool down. The focus is on technique rather than intensity, and the low max rhythm (18) further supports this classification. Thus, the Effort Difficulty is appropriately classified as 'Light'.",
