  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is under 6 minutes and is designated as a 'cool down', indicating very low energy expenditure. The maximum rhythm is only 18, further supporting the low-intensity classification. These factors strongly align with a Light effort difficulty, with some minor consideration for Moderate due to the potential for slight exertion in maintaining technical form in rowing.",
