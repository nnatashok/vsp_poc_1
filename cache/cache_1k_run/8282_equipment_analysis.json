  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Post-Row Pilates,' which indicates a Pilates session following a rowing activity. The description mentions building strength and stretching, which are typical Pilates components often performed on a mat. Additionally, the 'Category: On The Mat' explicitly suggests that a mat is necessary for this workout. The image further supports this, showing an individual performing exercises on a mat. Given this information, the confidence score for needing a mat is very high at 0.9. No other equipment is mentioned or implied."
