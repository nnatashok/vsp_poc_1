  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's name and description emphasize high-intensity intervals ('Focus on your split as you move through high-intensity intervals'), suggesting an energetic and intense session, which is corroborated by its format (HIIT), intensity level (3 out of 3), and high-tempo music (Dance high, Global Hits). These elements strongly support a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit (score: 0.9). \n\nAdditionally, the image accompanying the metadata shows rowing in a natural outdoor setting, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.7), emphasizing exploration and engagement with nature. \n\nThe rhythmic music and focus on split times indirectly hint at a performance-oriented approach, but the primary emphasis remains on intensity and outdoor elements, thus excluding spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structure & Discipline' from consideration."
