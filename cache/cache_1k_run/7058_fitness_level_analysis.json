  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Although short in duration (1 minute 43 seconds), the workout's 'Power' format and max rhythm of 32 indicate a high-intensity, all-out effort session. The intensity level marked as 3 out of 3 supports a classification of extreme effort difficulty, particularly given the expected physical demand and focus on lowest split times, making it highly demanding even in a brief time frame.",
