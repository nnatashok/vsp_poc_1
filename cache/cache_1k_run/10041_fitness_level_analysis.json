  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout category 'row' indicates that the technique difficulty can only be 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate'. The description mentions \"stroke-based intervals\", which is a core aspect of rowing but not overly complex. Additionally, no specialized technique or advanced movements are highlighted. Therefore, the primary technique difficulty aligns with 'Beginner' (score: 0.8) due to simplicity in rowing form, with some elements of 'Intermediate' (score: 0.5) due to the interval nature requiring rhythm adjustments.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short at 11 minutes and 20 seconds, but the max rhythm of 30 and the interval-based format both contribute to a higher intensity that supports an effort difficulty of at least 'Moderate' (score: 0.7). The 'sweat' workout type and intensity level 2 out of 3 suggests a higher physical demand, thus providing partial alignment with 'Challenging' (score: 0.4).",
