The workout occurs on the Charles River, implying a calming, repetitive visual environment. These characteristics argue for a moderate match to \"The Meditative Grind.\" \n\nThe use of pop music and global hits from the playlist suggests an elevated energy that contributes to a feel-good, steady build, fitting \"The Endorphin Wave\" vibe. The 11-minute duration and medium intensity level further support a consistent yet elevated experience.
