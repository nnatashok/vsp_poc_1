  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' typically suggests advanced technique due to its requirement for strong rowing mechanics and control, but since it aligns with the 'row' category, Technique Difficulty defaults to Intermediate with some aspects that could be viewed as Advanced given the high rhythm intervals. This leads to a strong indication of Intermediate with some alignment toward Advanced complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The interval nature of the workout with high rhythms of 28 and 30 and the 'drive' type suggests a very demanding effort level. The short duration is offset by the high intensity indicated by maximum music rhythms and a workout intensity level of 3 out of 3, pointing toward a Challenging to Extreme effort level. This is well beyond what deconditioned users can handle, confirming a strong to very strong alignment with Challenging, and moderate to strong alignment with Extreme.",
