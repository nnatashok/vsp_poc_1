  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which restricts the technique difficulty classification to Beginner or Intermediate. The 'sweat' category with a maximum rhythm of 30 and 'Climb' format suggests a higher intensity but not significantly complex movements. The use of rowing techniques places it within Beginner to Intermediate on Technique Difficulty. A slightly higher score for Beginner is assigned because this does not require advanced rowing techniques or precision beyond a general rowing form.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 16.5 minutes long with an 'intensity level' of 2 out of 3. It involves rowing in rhythm during three and four-minute intervals that resemble steadily paced but demanding climbs. Such aspects align well with Moderate effort difficulty while extending some capacity into the Challenging domain due to HIIT-like intervals, even though the duration leans towards Moderate.",
