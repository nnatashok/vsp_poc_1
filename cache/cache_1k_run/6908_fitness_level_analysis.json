  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is approximately 10 minutes, which is relatively short and involves stretching. Both factors indicate low physical demand. There are no indications of high-intensity or energy-expending activities. Therefore, the effort difficulty is classified as 'Light' with a very strong alignment (score 0.95). There's a minimal possibility for 'Moderate' level due to the potential of sustained holds during stretches, but any such possibility is very weak (score 0.05).",
