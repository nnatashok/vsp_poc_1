  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.75, supported by the image of rowing on water outdoors, which indicates a nature-based setting. The rhythmic increase in rowing pace every minute ('Shift up in rhythm each minute') aligns well with a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, scoring 0.7, due to its emphasis on smooth, coordinated movements and integration with pop music. Finally, 'High-Energy & Intense' is also relevant, though to a slightly lesser extent at 0.6, due to the workout's interval format and 'sweat' category, which suggests a significant effort level, despite the intensity being moderate (level 2 out of 3). Other spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are less applicable due to the workout's dynamic, less methodical, non-restorative nature."
