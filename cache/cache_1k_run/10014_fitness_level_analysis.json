Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 20-minute duration with dumbbell exercises and a focus on lower body circuits hints at a low-to-medium energy expenditure. The interval nature in a circuit format typically requires continuous effort but is usually modulated for broader accessibility. The max rhythm of 26 indicates a moderate pace, suggesting moderate effort difficulty suitable for someone beyond a complete beginner but manageable for most users with a low fitness level.",
