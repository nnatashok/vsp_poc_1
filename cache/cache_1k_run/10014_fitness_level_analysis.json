Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 20 minutes and the description indicating 'feel the burn,' the workout appears to fall between Moderate and Challenging levels of effort difficulty. The inclusion of intervals suggests an increased intensity likely making it more challenging than a simple steady-state workout. However, the overall duration and the format (circuit training with intervals) suggest it is not as extreme as intense circuit training or heavy weightlifting, generating energy expenditure that fits between Moderate and Challenging.",
