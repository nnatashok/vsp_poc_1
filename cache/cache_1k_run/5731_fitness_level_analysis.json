Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of approximately 16 minutes and the session being described as a 'Core Flow' focusing on core engagement, the workout likely involves continuous movement typical of flow sequences, possibly challenging at a moderate intensity. The playlist suggests a relaxed, chill tempo, which aligns with yoga practices that maintain steady breath and moderate exertion. The classification suggests efforts between light to moderate, owing to its short duration and the likely absence of high-intensity elements typical of other more demanding workouts. Users in lesser shape might find it demanding due to sustained core activation, hence a slight challenging aspect.",
