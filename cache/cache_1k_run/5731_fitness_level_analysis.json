  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is under 16 minutes, focusing on core engagement, suggesting a mild intensity level typical of yoga flows. The 'chill' and 'downtempo' music correlates with lower intensity levels. The short duration and the relaxation aspect strongly indicate a Light effort level, making it accessible, while the Moderate level accounts for consistent engagement over the session.",
