  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata indicates a category of 'row,' making the use of a rowing machine very likely. Additionally, the format is labeled as 'Power,' and the wave references 'rhythms 28 thru 32 at maximum pace,' which is typical for rowing workouts where pace and rhythm are key. The image provided features rowing equipment, further supporting this requirement. Given these details, the confidence level for needing a rowing machine is very high."
