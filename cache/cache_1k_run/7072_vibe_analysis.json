  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe classification was primarily driven by the 'Cardio Boost Row' workout's focus on sustained rhythm and breath-centered rowing, captured by phrases like 'row at a rhythm 22.' This repetition and endurance aspect, combined with a moderate pace (rhythm 22), fits well with 'The Meditative Grind,' capturing a zone-in, focused energy (score: 0.7). Additionally, the interval format and use of engaging pop tracks suggest an elevated, feel-good experience, aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave' (score: 0.6). The rhythmic music further enhances this vibe. The low intensity level (1 out of 3) and the pop music genre exclude high-intensity vibes like 'The Warrior Workout.' Overall, the workout emphasizes steady, rhythmic rowing with a mood-boosting playlist for a balanced, enjoyable session."
