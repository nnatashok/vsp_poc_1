  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Post-Row Stretch,' and the description mentions stepping off your Hydrow, which is a type of rowing machine. This implies that a rowing machine is involved in the workout process, particularly preceding the stretching routine. Therefore, a 'Rowing machine' is likely required, warranting a confidence score of 0.8. The category 'On The Mat' and the image showing the participant seated on a mat suggest that a 'Mat' is necessary for performing the stretches comfortably. Consequently, the confidence score for a 'Mat' is 0.9."
