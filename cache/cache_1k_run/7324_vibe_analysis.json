  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Masterclass Workout' due to its focus on technique, skill, and stability building indicated by the description 'Build hip and core stability with Christie and James in this beginner friendly pilates'. Pilates is known for technique-driven and focused exercises, justifying a high score of 0.8.\n\n'Zen Flow' is also relevant as the workout likely involves breath-centric, intentional movement, common in Pilates. The absence of high intensity also suggests a more grounding and unhurried experience, warranting a score of 0.6.\n\nThe inclusion of music by R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL and 'Dance mid, Global Hits' stations suggests a rhythmic, beat-driven backdrop which aligns with 'The Groove Session'. This contributes a mild score of 0.4 as it adds a layer of expressive movement without taking over the focus.\n\nOverall, there's high confidence (0.85) in these vibes due to explicit indicators in the description and typical Pilates characteristics. Other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded due to the workout's gentle nature and lack of intensity."
