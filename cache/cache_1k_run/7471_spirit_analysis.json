  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Upper Body Strength\" with a focus on \"beginner friendly bodyweight exercises\" suggests a \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit, scoring 0.7. This score is supported by the specificity of building strength and the categorization as a 'standard' on-the-mat workout, indicating a methodical approach. \n\nAdditionally, the use of \"Indie Alternative\" and \"Global Hits\" music might add a \"Flow & Rhythm\" element, scoring 0.3, as the music could encourage a smooth and engaging session while performing the exercises. \n\nThe absence of equipment and the short duration further imply a simple and straightforward routine typical of disciplined, structured workouts. Other spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Outdoor & Adventure\" were excluded due to the lack of high-intensity indicators or outdoor elements."
