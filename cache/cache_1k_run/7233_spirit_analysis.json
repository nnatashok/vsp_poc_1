  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout named 'Post-Row Stretch' is explicitly designed as a recovery session lasting around five minutes, which aligns perfectly with a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. Its focus on stretching, recommendation for yoga blocks, and emphasis on hip and glute relaxation strongly suggest a restorative purpose, justifying a high score of 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nThe choice of music genres, such as 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits,' along with an artist like Bonobo known for ambient and rhythmic tracks, suggests some elements of flow might be present, contributing to a secondary 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. However, given the session's emphasis on stretching rather than movement patterns, this spirit is less pronounced, reflected in a lower score of 0.4.\n\nThe environment and nature of the session do not suggest other spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Structured & Disciplined,' 'Sport & Agility,' or 'Outdoor & Adventure,' hence they are excluded."
