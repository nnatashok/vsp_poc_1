  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Advanced HIIT Row' and falls under the categories 'Drive, standard, row', strongly suggesting the use of a rowing machine. The term 'HIIT Row' and reference to 'max rhythm' at '32' indicates that the central aspect of the workout is based on rowing, likely indoors, which typically involves a rowing machine. Additionally, the 'Type: drive' further points to dynamic and rhythmic rowing workouts. Therefore, the requirement of a rowing machine is almost certain with very high confidence (1.0). The attached image shows outdoor water rowing, but for indoor settings, a rowing machine would be the equivalent equipment."
