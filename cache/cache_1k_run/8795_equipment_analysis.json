  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description indicates a focus on the upper body and mentions '90-second intervals on Hydrow.' 'Hydrow' is a specific brand of rowing machine, which suggests that a rowing machine is required for this workout, leading to a high confidence score of 0.8 for the Rowing machine.\n\nThe available metadata explicitly lists 'dumbbells' in the 'Equipment' field, resulting in a very high confidence score of 1.0 for Dumbbells as they are explicitly part of the workout.\n\nThe categories 'On The Mat' and 'standard,on-the-mat' imply that some exercises are performed on the floor, suggesting the use of a Mat, although it's not explicitly mentioned. This results in a moderate confidence score of 0.65 for the Mat. This decision is based on typical practices in workouts categorized as 'on the mat,' which often involve exercises that are more comfortable on cushioned surfaces.\n\nNo other equipment is suggested by the metadata, and the specific focus on upper body and rowing confirms the necessity of the equipment listed."
