  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Teammate Energy Row' is characterized by two primary spirits: 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Outdoor & Adventure.' The 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is evident due to the format of 'interval' training and the category 'sweat,' which suggests a focus on intensity and exertion (score: 0.7). The description hints at a motivational and energetic environment with the phrase 'Feel the energy working out with both Buffy and James,' supporting this spirit. The music choice, including tracks like 'Moves Like Jagger,' further indicates a lively atmosphere.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is strongly supported by the image showing rowing on a river and the collaborative, adventurous nature of outdoor rowing. The presence of the actual rowing scene in a natural setting significantly contributes to this classification (score: 0.8). This spirit is further reinforced by the workout being categorized under 'standard row,' indicating an outdoor rowing activity.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Flow & Rhythm' spirits are less applicable here as the focus is more on the intensity and outdoor elements rather than methodical techniques or smooth movement patterns."
