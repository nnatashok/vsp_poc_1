  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is categorized as 'row' and 'breathe', which generally involves a steady and rhythmic style of rowing. Rowing, by its nature, doesn't require complex movements beyond basic coordination and form. The steady format and the low-intensity level (1 out of 3) suggest it is approachable for beginners. The 'steady' format implies a consistent, controlled pace which aligns with beginner capabilities, especially given the absence of high technical challenges. Thus, the technique difficulty is most closely aligned with 'Beginner' with a possibility of 'Intermediate' for those who might struggle with maintaining form over time.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is approximately 31 minutes, and it is a 'steady' row, indicating a prolonged exercise at a consistent pace but lower intensity, supported by the workout intensity level marked as 1 out of 3. The classification under 'breathe' suggests a focus on endurance at a relaxed pace rather than high energy output. The inclusion of motivational 90s music further indicates a casual, enjoyable workout. Although the duration slightly suggests 'Moderate' difficulty, the focus on breath and rhythm puts it solidly under 'Light' effort for most users.",
