  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'row', which typically aligns technique difficulty with either Beginner or Intermediate levels. Given the focus on 'steady' rowing and an intensity level of 1 out of 3, it leans more towards Beginner. There are no complex rowing techniques or coordination-heavy instructions mentioned. Thus, I assess a strong alignment with Beginner (0.8) and some with Intermediate (0.4) for technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity is rated 1 out of 3, indicating a low effort demand, suitable for Light difficulty. The 31-minute duration and steady rowing might pose a slight challenge to those with very low fitness, suggesting a moderate alignment with Light (0.8) and some with Moderate (0.5) due to sustained activity duration.",
