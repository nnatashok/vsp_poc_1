  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is relatively short at 11:23 minutes and is rated with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, indicating it is designed to be low effort. The 'breathe' workout type further suggests a focus on gentle, steady activity without intense bursts, aligning closely with a 'Light' effort difficulty. The use of a max rhythm of 26 in a beginner setting supports a Light effort difficulty classification with slight Moderate considerations due to rhythm changes.",
