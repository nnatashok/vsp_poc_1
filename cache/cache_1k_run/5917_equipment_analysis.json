  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Core Burn Express' and classified under the 'On The Mat' category, indicating activities performed on a mat. The workout type is specified as 'pilates,' which typically requires a mat for floor exercises and comfort, especially for core strengthening routines. The description does not mention any other equipment, and the image confirms the use of a mat. Therefore, I identify a 'Mat' with very high confidence. No other equipment is indicated in the title, description, or image."
