  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 5 minutes and 38 seconds, suggesting minimal effort difficulty, aligning primarily with Light intensity. The focus on Pilates-specific post-row recovery means movements are likely gentle and not energy-intensive. However, engaging in glute activation can introduce a low to moderate effort aspect, depending on intensity, justifying a slight score elevation for Moderate.",
