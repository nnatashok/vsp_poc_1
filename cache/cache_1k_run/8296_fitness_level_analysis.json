  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of just 5 minutes and 40 seconds and categorized as stretching, this workout is low-intensity. Stretching inherently has low energy expenditure and promotes relaxation, further emphasized by the use of yoga blocks (which often indicate modifications for ease). Therefore, it aligns strongly with a Light effort difficulty. The music genre being dance doesn't intrinsically increase the effort level within such a short and easy session.",
