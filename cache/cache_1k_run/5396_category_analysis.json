The workout name 'Team Endurance Row' clearly states that it is a rowing workout. The description further emphasizes it as an 'endurance row,' indicating a focus on indoor rowing activities. The mention of 'Format: Climb' suggests a structured rowing intensity akin to rowing machine workouts. The workout type 'breathe' suggests maintaining a consistent pace, which aligns with the endurance aspect typical of rowing sessions. Additionally, the intensity level is set at 1 out of 3, indicating a low-moderate intensity typical for endurance rowing. The presence of music genres like dance and global hits supports a dynamic and engaging rhythm, often associated with longer-duration rowing workouts. The absence of an instructor further emphasizes the self-paced nature, suitable for a rowing machine workout."
