  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is short in duration (6 minutes) and is categorized as a warm-up, suggesting low energy expenditure. While the bursts of speed may offer some moderate exertion, the primary focus appears to be on technique improvements rather than vigorous activity, aligning well with the Light level (score 1.0). The 'bursts of half-slide strokes' could slightly increase intensity, moderately fitting the Moderate level (score 0.4). Overall, the brief duration and purpose aim for gentle engagement.",
