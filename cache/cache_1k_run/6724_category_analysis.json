  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Indoor rowing' with high confidence, as indicated by the strong reference to 'learn to maintain power at lower rhythms' and the '1-minute intervals lowering in rhythm,' which are specific to rowing workouts. The metadata also uses the term 'row' in the category section. The mention of 'Reverse Climb' further supports rowing activities rather than other workout forms. Despite the 'warm-up' label, the structured intervals and rhythm focus are characteristic of rowing exercises. The lack of explicit mention of any other workout type or equipment also supports this classification."
