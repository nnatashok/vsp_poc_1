  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"Soothing & Restorative\" with a score of 0.8 due to the keywords \"slowing down\" and \"creating space for yourself\" in the title and description, which suggest a focus on relaxation and calmness. The intensity level is 1 out of 3, further supporting a gentle focus. The oldies playlist with soul/funk tunes complements a soothing atmosphere.\n\n\"Outdoor & Adventure\" is relevant with a score of 0.7, as the image indicates the session takes place on a river, fitting the natural, exploratory aspect of outdoor workouts.\n\n\"Flow & Rhythm\" also applies with a score of 0.6. The use of music-driven pacing from the oldies playlist and the term \"breathe\" suggest an emphasis on rhythmic movement and mind-body connection.\n\nOther spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Sport & Agility\" are excluded due to lack of intensity and performance-focused indicators. \"Structured & Disciplined\" is irrelevant here due to the absence of methodical progression cues."
