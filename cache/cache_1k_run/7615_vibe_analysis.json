  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe of 'Connection Cool-Down' is predominantly 'The Meditative Grind' due to its focus on steady, rhythmic rowing at a low pace, which encourages repetitive, meditative movement. The steady format and low rhythm (max 20) further reinforce a meditative experience, allowing participants to zone in. This vibe is supported by the mention of 'staying connected through your body each stroke,' which calls for mindfulness and attention to form. The use of Indie Alternative and Global Hits music, including songs like 'Steal My Sunshine' and 'Down Under,' adds a light, relaxed mood that complements a meditative vibe, contributing to a score of 0.7 for this vibe.\n\nThe 'Reboot Workout' vibe is also relevant, given the workout's classification as a cool-down, which implies a focus on gentle movement and recovery. The short duration (5 minutes 40 seconds) and the indie playlist can help create a refreshing and light-hearted environment, aligning with the vibe of a total-body refresh, thus receiving a score of 0.6. \n\nOther vibes like 'The Zen Flow' were considered due to the breath-centered aspect but were excluded as the workout lacks explicit emphasis on slow, intentional movements and is more rhythmic in nature."
