  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is a warm-up and very short with a duration of 5:42, indicating low energy expenditure, aligning strongly with a Light effort level. The inclusion of rhythmic changes every 30 seconds may add a touch of dynamism, slightly supporting a Moderate effort rating. However, overall, the short duration and warm-up nature suggest a primary classification as Light.",
