  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Pick Drill Cool-Down' focusing on technique with Aisyah. The category includes 'row', which suggests it is a rowing-related activity. The image also depicts an individual on a rowing boat, further implying that rowing is central to the exercise. Thus, a 'Rowing machine' is essential with very high confidence (0.9) as it is integral for performing the drill effectively, especially within an indoor or controlled environment, aligning with the metadata."
