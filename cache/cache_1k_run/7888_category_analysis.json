  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Yoga' with a score of 0.9, supported by several key pieces of metadata. The workout name 'Power Flow' and the term 'flow' in the workout type strongly suggest a dynamic form of yoga, likely Vinyasa or Power Yoga, which involves flowing from one pose to another. The description mentions 'yoga blocks optional,' further confirming this category as yoga flows often incorporate props like blocks. The scenic location in Vallavik, Norway, while relevant to ambiance, does not sway the category choice. The secondary category is 'Mat' with a score of 0.7, because the description and tags ('On The Mat') indicate the workout is performed on an exercise mat, typical for yoga sessions. The playlist, featuring chill and downtempo music, complements a yoga session atmosphere but doesn't add significant weight to other categories. No indicators suggest any other category fit, especially since no high-intensity or equipment-based activities are mentioned. Overall, the indicators strongly support yoga and mat-based exercise classification."
