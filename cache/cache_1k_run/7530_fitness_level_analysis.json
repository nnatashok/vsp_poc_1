  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily a rowing session, categorized under 'Sweat', with a focus on rhythm and intensity. Given the workout type is 'row', technique difficulty is constrained to either 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate'. The description suggests increasing rhythm which may require some coordination, aligning with 'Intermediate'. However, it remains largely accessible due to its standard categorization, resulting in a strong alignment with 'Beginner'.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout spans 21 minutes and is formatted as an interval 'sweat' session, suggesting increased intensity with tempo changes. The intensity level given is 2 out of 3, indicating a medium-to-high effort level. Given the interval nature and consistent 5-minute rhythm increases, it leans towards 'Challenging' but remains primarily 'Moderate' for users with lower fitness levels, hence a stronger alignment with 'Moderate'.",
