  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'Drive' and 'Power,' inherently implying high technique demands typical to rowing with significant rhythm and power requirements. The instructor's world-class credentials and emphasis on 'in-depth technical detail' reinforce this classification. The high rhythm (32+) suggests precise control, and the metadata specifies 'expert technical instruction,' indicating a strong alignment with the Advanced category. While the Hydrow rule limits rowing to Beginner or Intermediate, 'Drive' overrides this by demanding advanced technique.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's 16:46 duration and 3 out of 3 intensity rating alongside phrases like 'rack up those meters' and 'maintain high rhythms' corroborate a demanding session. The instructor's motivation to aim for a 'new personal best' suggests significant effort. Although it's shorter than a typical extreme effort session, the intensity cues (high rhythms, power) plus the Drive format and high-energy music playlist contribute to a Challenging level, with aspects of Extreme due to intensity.",
