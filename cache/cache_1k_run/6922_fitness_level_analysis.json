  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is classified under the 'row' category, which typically keeps technique complexity at a Beginner or Intermediate level. The 'Drive' designation, alongside descriptions of high rhythms, suggests a need for greater coordination and control, justifying an Intermediate score with high confidence. However, the rowing movements standard to this category inherently include simpler, rhythmic actions, warranting a slight inclusion of Beginner-level complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of nearly 17 minutes and a maximum rhythm over 32, coupled with a format classified as 'Power' and the top intensity level of 3, the workout demands significant physical effort from participants. This combination of factors strongly correlates with a Challenging level of effort, indicating high expenditure and intensity. The encouragement to achieve personal bests suggests potential for reaching Extreme effort, albeit marginally due to standard guidelines.",
