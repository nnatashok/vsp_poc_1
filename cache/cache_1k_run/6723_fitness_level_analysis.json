  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout categorization as 'Drive' under Hydrow's platform rules suggests a higher level of technical complexity within the rowing focus, typically classified as Advanced. However, the metadata lacks specific indicators of complex maneuvers beyond interval rowing paced at high intensity. Hence, aligning both Beginner and Intermediate levels fits the rowing movement requirement since 'row' defaults to those levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is over 21 minutes with 15\" to 45\" intervals, and a maximal rhythm of 36 suggests high intensity. Intensity marked as 3 out of 3 and HIIT format indicate significant effort, aligning with Challenging. The structured intervals and high rhythm push towards Extreme for low fitness users, meriting lower alignment there.",
