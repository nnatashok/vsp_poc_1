  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is focused on rowing, which typically involves basic to intermediate rowing techniques with minimal coordination needed, especially given the category is 'row'. However, the presence of the 'climb' format suggests a moderate complexity increase due to potential changes in rhythm and intensity. Therefore, the technique difficulty is classified as both Beginner and Intermediate with equal moderate confidence.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of over 30 minutes with a max rhythm of 30, suggesting a moderately sustained effort level. The 'sweat' type indicates medium intensity, aligning with moderate effort. The intensity rating of 2 out of 3 further supports a classification primarily at Moderate. Given the duration and rhythm, a Challenging level could apply for less conditioned users.",
