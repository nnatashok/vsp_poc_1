Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 20-minute duration combined with an emphasis on elevated heart rate points to a workout of moderate intensity, suitable for moderately conditioned individuals. The 'strength' focus suggests some muscular fatigue, slightly increasing effort. Consequently, it aligns well with 'Moderate' due to sustained activity over 20 minutes. However, for deconditioned users, the continuous focus without heavy rests may verge on 'Challenging,' suggesting a smaller alignment here.",
