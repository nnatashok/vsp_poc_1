  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Flow + Restore' indicates a program centered on smooth, continuous movements ('flow') with a focus on grounding and restorative poses. This aligns strongly with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, which is characterized by intentional and breath-centered practice. The use of the word 'restore' and the emphasis on grounding provide strong indicators. The playlist with chill, downtempo tracks like those by R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL and Maggie Rogers supports this relaxed, mindful vibe.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Reboot Workout' vibe is applicable due to the restorative component aimed at refreshing the body and mind, enhancing the rejuvenating nature of the session. Both vibes establish a strong connection to relaxation and mindfulness, absent of high intensity or competitive elements, justifying the high confidence level of 0.95 in this classification."
