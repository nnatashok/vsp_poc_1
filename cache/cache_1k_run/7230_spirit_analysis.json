  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Post-Row Align' is primarily described as a relaxing alignment session intended for recovery and relaxation, suggesting a strong 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. Keywords like 'recover,' 'relaxing,' and the use of yoga blocks indicate a focus on gentle and restorative movements. The music playlist, featuring chill and downtempo tracks, supports a calming atmosphere, reinforcing this classification with a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe session takes place outdoors, as evidenced by the image and the placement within the 'On The Mat' category, which is often associated with outdoor settings. This gives additional weight to an 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification, albeit with a lower score of 0.7, due to the primary focus on soothing recovery rather than exploration or adventure. The scenic outdoor environment contributes to an adventurous and explorative aspect, though it remains secondary to the restorative aim of the workout.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to the clear emphasis on recovery and the lack of high-intensity, structured, or sport-specific elements in the metadata."
