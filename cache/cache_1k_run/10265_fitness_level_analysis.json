  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as a 'drive' type, which typically includes high-intensity interval rowing workouts. This format inherently suggests a technique difficulty around the Intermediate level due to the coordination required for maintaining high stroke rates and adjusting between 30 to 28 S/M. However, the emphasis on pushing limits and mimicking a race adds complexity, warranting a slight alignment with Advanced techniques due to needing practiced skill in rowing form to avoid injury during such intense efforts.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is short at 8:38 minutes, but with an emphasis on high intensity (especially being labeled 3 out of 3 for intensity) and interval format, it demands significant cardiovascular and muscular effort. The 2,000-meter race simulation with high stroke rates (up to 34 S/M) suggests a challenging effort for the average user, bordering on extreme for deconditioned participants. While the effort is very demanding, the short duration limits overall energy expenditure, justifying a Challenging primary rating with an Extreme secondary consideration.",
