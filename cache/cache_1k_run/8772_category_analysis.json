  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Surprise Rhythm Row' and described as involving intervals with a rhythm, along with a maximum rhythm of 34, indicates it is an 'Indoor rowing' workout. The use of terms such as 'intervals,' 'drive,' and 'standard,row' in the category section strongly points to a rowing machine workout. Additionally, the format is explicitly mentioned as HIIT, which justifies classifying it under the 'HIIT' category as well. The music from Dance high and Global Hits aligns with high-intensity sessions typical of HIIT workouts. Given the metadata and description, 'Indoor rowing' receives a high score of 0.8 due to clear evidence supporting this category as the primary activity, while 'HIIT' has a score of 0.6 reflecting its strong presence but as a secondary characteristic of the workout."
