  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Pilates' involves pilates, typically characterized by fluidity and a core focus, aligning well with 'The Groove Session' vibe. The explicit lyrics in the music and featured tracks like 'High And Low' by Empire Of The Sun, suggest a rhythmic and engaging session, supportive of the Groove Session vibe (score 0.7). The scenic location on the cliffs of Achill Island provides a serene element, indicating 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to the repetitive and focused nature of pilates (score 0.6). Additionally, the breathtaking outdoor setting suggests elements of 'The Zen Flow,' with its grounding and intentional qualities (score 0.5). Overall, the explicit music alongside pilates blends both a fun and meditative experience."
