  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Bodyweight Circuit' implies a high level of intensity due to the use of the circuit format, which often involves a quick pace and minimal rest between exercises, aligning with the High-Energy & Intense spirit (0.75). The use of AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) further signifies an intense and high-effort nature. \n\nFlow & Rhythm (0.6) is suggested by the description indicating that the workout is suitable 'for all levels' and the presence of music, which can establish a rhythmic pace, encouraging continuous movement and coordination. The radio stations, such as Country and Global Hits, albeit unspecified, could indicate a broad appeal facilitating rhythm and flow during the session.\n\nStructured & Disciplined (0.55) is considered due to the methodical nature of circuit training and the AMRAP format, which requires adherence to a structured approach and promotes discipline through self-pacing and progression. \n\nThe \u2018On The Mat\u2019 category and absence of nature-based indicators reduce the likelihood of an Outdoor & Adventure spirit. Hence, it was not selected."
