  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'drive' which, according to Hydrow's specific classification, indicates an Advanced technique level. The use of high-intensity intervals (HIIT) and max rhythm of 32 also suggests a need for good coordination and body awareness, supporting an Advanced classification of 0.8. However, given it's row-based, it may accommodate Intermediate users, albeit at a lower score.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The metadata indicates an intense workout: 'high intensity intervals', a 'drive' workout type, and an intensity level of 3 out of 3. The duration of 21 minutes is short, but the HIIT format with no rest intervals leads to high physical demand. With a max rhythm of 32, the energy expenditure will be significant, justifying an Extreme effort level with a 0.9 score.",
