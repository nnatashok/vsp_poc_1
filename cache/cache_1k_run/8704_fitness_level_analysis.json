  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout classification as a 'drive' in the rowing category limits the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate by definition, aligning with the Hydrow-specific rules. The description indicates high-intensity intervals, suggesting a moderately complex execution requiring good coordination and form, justifying the Intermediate classification. ",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of approximately 31 minutes and an intensity level of 3 out of 3 indicate significant physical demand. The interval format with high-intensity cues further increases energy expenditure. This fits solidly into the Challenging range with some indicators of Extreme effort for less conditioned users. Additionally, a max rhythm of 30 aligns it with considerably high energy output, suggesting substantial physical exertion.",
