Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short at 10:41 minutes. This duration, paired with the 'strength' focus, suggests low to moderate effort difficulty. Users might engage in low to medium intensity exercises, implying light energy expenditure for beginners or moderate for slightly more fit individuals. No intense peak efforts or prolonged duration that would challenge the cardiovascular system intensely are indicated.",
