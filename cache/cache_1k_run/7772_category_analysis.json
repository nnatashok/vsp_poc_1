  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout 'Peppy HIIT Row' is strongly categorized as HIIT due to explicit mentions in both the title and description. The presence of '30-second and 60-second intervals' is typical of high-intensity interval training, directly correlating to the HIIT category. Additionally, the description suggests an energetic and intensive session, further supported by the use of the phrase 'bring some energy' and a 'workout intensity level' of 3 out of 3. The format specified as 'HIIT' in the metadata solidifies this categorization. While rowing appears to be involved, the focus on intervals and intensity justifies the primary classification as HIIT. There are no compelling indications for other categories such as 'Indoor rowing', as the central theme revolves around the interval training format."
