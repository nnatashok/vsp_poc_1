  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Glacier Facts Row' has a duration of 16 minutes and 30 seconds, focusing on climbing in rhythm, which aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The repeated rowing action combined with intervals suggests steady and focused effort. The outdoor theme and Alaskan scenery resonate with 'The Nature Flow,' emphasizing a connection to nature. The music playlist, featuring pop hits by Lady Gaga, Sia, and P!NK, adds an energized backdrop, suggesting 'The Endorphin Wave' as another fitting vibe, with an elevated energy and feel-good atmosphere. The workout intensity level of 2 out of 3 and the sweat category further support these vibes. There's moderate confidence due to explicit rhythm indications and music influences."
