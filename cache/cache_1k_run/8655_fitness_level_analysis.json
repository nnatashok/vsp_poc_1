  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a short duration of 5 minutes and 50 seconds, classified as a 'cool down', this workout is designed to be low intensity. The focus on control and pausing confirms a relaxed pace intended for calming the body post-exercise, rather than stimulating high energy output. This aligns strongly with a Light effort difficulty, emphasizing relaxation and gentle movement suitable for recovery rather than exertion.",
