  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Yoga' with a score of 0.9. This determination is based on the workout name 'Yoga for Sleep' which explicitly mentions 'Yoga'. The description supports this by highlighting a body and mind focus, characteristic of yoga routines. The mention of 'restore' aligns with restorative yoga practices that are calm and meditative.\n\n'Meditation' is given a secondary category with a score of 0.6 because the description emphasizes 'winding down your thoughts', suggesting a focus on relaxation and mental preparation for sleep, which is typical of meditation practices. The music genres 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' further suggest a calming atmosphere conducive to meditation.\n\nThe category 'Mat' was considered due to the mention of 'On The Mat', but given the specific reference to yoga, this was not pursued further as the primary categories better capture the workout's essence."
