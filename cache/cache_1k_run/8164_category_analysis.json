  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout aims at strengthening the lower body using mini bands, which typically involves exercises performed on the floor with a mat. The title 'Lower Body Strength with Bands' clearly indicates a strength focus with minimal equipment, aligning with the 'Mat' category. The description reinforces this by specifying 'build strength in your lower body,' suggesting exercises like squats or lunges on a mat. Furthermore, the categorization 'On The Mat' directly supports placing this in the 'Mat' category. While no specific equipment other than mini bands is noted, the workout's strength aspect naturally lends itself to the 'Body weight' category, as body weight and resistance bands are used to provide resistance. The playlist, high tempo music usually used for energetic but not necessarily high-intensity exercises, supports the classification. Combined, these elements justify a strong presence of 'Mat' and a notable component of 'Body weight' with high confidence."
