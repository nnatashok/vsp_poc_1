  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Finding Peace Row' primarily aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, reflected in the title and description. Phrases like 'Finding Peace' and 'breathe' suggest a focus on relaxation and gentle effort, reinforced by the low intensity level of 1 out of 3. The use of songs that are more introspective and calming further supports this classification, giving it a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is notable due to the mention of a 'pyramid' format, which indicates a methodical approach with predetermined effort levels. The use of specific 'Max rhythm' in the metadata also reflects a planned structure, warranting a score of 0.7.\n\nFinally, the session shows elements of 'Flow & Rhythm' with its endurance-building nature and smooth, continuous pacing at a consistent rhythm, indicated by the max 24 rhythm and the choice of music, earning a score of 0.6.\n\nThe classification does not strongly suggest a High-Energy, Sport & Agility, or Outdoor & Adventure spirit due to the workout's calming nature and structured indoor setting."
