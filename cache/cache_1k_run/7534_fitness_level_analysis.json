  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', which typically aligns with techniques ranging from Beginner to Intermediate. The exercise description mentions 'climbing efforts' which may require moderate synchronization and rhythm control, suggestive of Intermediate complexity. However, rowing generally involves basic to moderate complexity, thus a Beginner difficulty is strongly present. With intermediate elements in the climbing format, Intermediate also holds some alignment.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The pace is set by two 3-minute climbing efforts and a final 1-minute high-intensity burst, suggesting a sustained moderate effort with a brief challenging spike. The total duration is relatively short (11 minutes), pointing to Moderate effort difficulty according to Hydrow's scoring. The intensity level is marked as '2 out of 3', aligning with Moderate but allowing for some aspects of Challenging due to the final all-out effort.",
