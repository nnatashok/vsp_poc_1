  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of about 20 minutes combined with a focus on strength exercises implies a moderate to challenging effort level for users with lower fitness levels. The intensity of strength-based circuits may demand significant effort, especially given the continuous nature suggested by the playlist. However, without specifics on exercise intensity, we lean towards Moderate as the primary classification, with potential for being Challenging for some users.",
