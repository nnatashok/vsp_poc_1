The max rhythm reaching only 26 strokes per minute and an intensity level of 1 out of 3 indicates a moderate and controlled session rather than high-intensity bursts, justifying a score of 0.7 for 'The Meditative Grind.' The inclusion of mainstream, easy-listening pop music supports an 'Endorphin Wave' vibe, as such music is often uplifting and helps in maintaining steady energy, fitting leisurely, endurance activities. The score of 0.6 reflects this alignment. Lastly, the social, interactive elements of getting to know the instructors align with 'The Groove Session,' promoting fun and immersion, though it's not the primary focus, giving it a slightly lower score of 0.5.""}}"

The workout's name, 'Finding Peace Row', suggests a focus on rhythm and consistency, characteristic of endurance-building sessions. The description emphasizes working at a consistent effort level in a low-intensity format with an emphasis on 'breathe', aligning well with the repetitive and meditative nature of rowing. The playlist with songs from the 90s featuring well-known ballads and classics further supports this vibe, as these tracks tend to provide a steady, calming influence ideal for a meditative workout.\n\n'The Zen Flow' is also identified as a secondary vibe due to the workout\u2019s low intensity and the focus on breathing, which is indicated by the category 'Breathe' and the low-intensity level noted as 1 out of 3. The workout\u2019s Pyramid format suggests fluid transitions, aligning with the calm, grounding nature of Zen routines. However, 'The Meditative Grind' is more applicable due to the endurance focus and less explicit detail on mindful pace changes, resulting in a slightly lower score for 'The Zen Flow'. Overall, confidence is high due to clear indicators in the metadata.""}}"
