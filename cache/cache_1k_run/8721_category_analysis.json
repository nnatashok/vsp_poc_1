  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout named 'Post-Row Mobility' strongly indicates a focus on mobility exercises after a rowing session, specifically mentioning 'Stretch out your body after your row.' This directly aligns with the category of Stretching, which involves exercises to improve flexibility and range of motion. The workout type is labeled as 'mobility,' further reinforcing the focus on stretching techniques rather than more intensive activities. This is supported by the genre of music played, which is conducive to a calming, stretch-friendly environment. The metadata categorizes the workout as 'On The Mat,' indicating that the exercises are performed on a mat, without the need for specialized equipment, which aligns with floor exercises typically categorized under Mat workouts. The combination of these elements\u2014focused stretching and mat usage\u2014clearly justify the assignment of Stretching (score: 0.9) as the primary category and Mat (score: 0.7) as a secondary category."
