  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'Yoga' with a very high confidence of 0.95 based on several compelling pieces of evidence from the metadata. The title 'Power Yoga Flow' directly suggests a yoga-based workout focusing on power yoga, a more vigorous approach to traditional yoga practices. The description further confirms this as it mentions the activity as a 'power yoga flow' which typically combines vinyasa flow and allows for vigorous postures. Additionally, the mention of 'Yoga blocks recommended' solidifies the yoga classification as blocks are commonly used in yoga for modification and support. The playlist featuring chill and downtempo music aligns with the calming yet engaging nature of a yoga session. Categories such as 'Stretching' or 'Mat' were considered but dismissed because the specific focus on 'Power Yoga' was evident. Hence, 'Yoga' is assigned a score of 0.9 to reflect its strong centrality to the workout."
