  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is best classified under \"Indoor rowing\" due to several strong indicators in the metadata. The description mentions accumulating maximum meters at high rhythms, which is characteristic of an indoor rowing workout, especially when combined with the term 'race'. The use of the word 'drive' in both the workout type and category tags ('Drive,standard,row') further suggests rowing, as 'drive' is a term often associated with the rowing stroke. The mention of 'max rhythm' and 'power' format supports high-intensity rowing efforts. With a high workout intensity level of 3 out of 3, the workout aligns well with an intense rowing session. The non-specific equipment field also implies using a rowing machine since no other equipment is mentioned."
