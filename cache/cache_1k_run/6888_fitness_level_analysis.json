  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The 'row' category dictates that Technique Difficulty must be at most 'Intermediate'. Given that this workout involves rowing with rhythmic shifting and is marked for 'Beginner' fitness level, most users would likely see it as basic. The format is 'Interval', which requires minor adjustments but does not typically advance beyond a basic coordination challenge. Thus, Beginner level as the strongest fit, with a nod to Intermediate difficulty due to rhythm shifts.",
