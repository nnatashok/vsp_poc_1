  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Rejuvenation Row' which hints at a refreshing and possibly rhythmic experience. The mention of 'intervals' and the workout being part of the 'sweat' category indicates a certain level of intensity, however, since the intensity is described as 2 out of 3, it is not at the highest energetic level. Therefore, a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is present, but only mildly, hence a score of 0.4. The description emphasizes 'move your body and enjoy the journey,' which, along with music elements like Hip Hop/R&B Mid and Global Hits, suggests a strong 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a score of 0.7. The inclusion of 'short intervals' and the background of the instructor as an Olympian implies a 'Structured & Disciplined' component, given the technical nature of rowing and the structured intervals, scoring 0.6. Overall, the workout is driven by rhythm but with structured intervals, marking both 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' as significant spirits, with 'High-Energy & Intense' being less pronounced due to the moderate intensity level."
