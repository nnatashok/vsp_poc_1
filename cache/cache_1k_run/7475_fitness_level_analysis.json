  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as a rowing-based routine (category: row). According to Hydrow's workout type rule, rowing can be rated at either Beginner or Intermediate. Given that this specific workout is labeled as a 'Drive' session, which typically implies a heightened level of technique due to more complex rowing sequences, an Intermediate technique difficulty classification is justified with strong confidence. The metadata does not highlight any expert-level rowing techniques; this supports Intermediate over Beginner.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The metadata emphasizes high intensity intervals and specifies a maximum rhythm of 30, indicating a high-energy HIIT workout. The duration of about 16 minutes aligns with typical HIIT protocols that focus on high workload in short timeframes. The workout intensity is rated 3 out of 3, suggesting extreme physical demand. Therefore, Extreme is a strong classification fit with high confidence due to the intense nature and rhythm pace. However, recognizing varied individual capacities, a Challenging classification was also considered.",
