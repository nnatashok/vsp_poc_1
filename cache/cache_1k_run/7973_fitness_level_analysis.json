Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is relatively short at 16 minutes and is labeled as a 'flow' session, synonymous with gentle, continuous movement which aligns with 'Light' effort. The calming music genre also suggests low physical exertion. Some mild challenges might arise due to the yoga component, slightly aligning with 'Moderate'. Thus, 'Light' effort is scored at 0.9, and 'Moderate' at 0.3.",
