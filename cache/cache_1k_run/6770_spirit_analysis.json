  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.8. This is supported by the focus on building foundational skills in classical pilates, which emphasizes smooth, controlled movements and mind-body coordination. The inclusion of pop music like Ed Sheeran's and other rhythmic songs suggests a flowing session with continuous movement patterns. \n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.7. The image shows the workout is conducted in a scenic outdoor setting by water, which fits the environmental and exploration aspects of this spirit. This setting adds an element of adventure to the otherwise structured pilates session.\n\n'Disciplined & Structured' was considered due to the foundational skill-building described, but was not chosen as the primary spirit because the description lacks emphasis on technical precision or progressive protocol."
