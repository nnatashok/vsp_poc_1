Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is short, only 5 minutes and 51 seconds, and categorized as a warm-up focusing on technique with pauses, indicating low energy expenditure. These factors strongly align with the Light effort difficulty level, making it suitable for users focused on basic skill acquisition rather than physical exertion. There is a minimal alignment with Moderate due to the intentional breakdown of movements, which may require slightly more attention and energy than static exercises, but not enough to warrant a higher score at Moderate.",
