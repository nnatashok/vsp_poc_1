  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is named 'Power Flow,' indicating a focus on smooth, continuous movement patterns, which aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The description states that the session involves moving through a 'power flow' with an optional use of yoga blocks, which corroborates this classification by emphasizing movement and coordination. The categorization as 'On The Mat' and the music playlist, featuring chill and downtempo tracks, further emphasize a rhythmic, flowing experience, justifying a strong score of 0.9.\n\nThe description also mentions a scenic location 'overlooking the water and mountains in Vallavik, Norway.' This natural outdoor setting aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Although it\u2019s an on-the-mat session, the presence of natural elements and the mention of the outdoor setting support a score of 0.8 for this spirit. Overall, the flow-centered description and location provide high confidence for this dual classification."
