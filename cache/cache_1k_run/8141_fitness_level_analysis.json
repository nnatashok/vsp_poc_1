Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The cool-down is short at 5 minutes and 39 seconds with a 'steady' format, typically indicating low-intensity. The description focuses on relaxation and reflection without mentioning any challenging exertion. While the pacing is steady, it does not appear to demand significant physical effort, thus aligning strongly with Light effort difficulty. The possibility of moderate effort due to maintaining rhythm and slight rowing effort is acknowledged but considered weaker.",
