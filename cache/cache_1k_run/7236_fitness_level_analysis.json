  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is a row with the specific format type 'Drive', which typically corresponds to a higher technique level according to Hydrow-specific rules. The metadata indicates a high rhythm and intense power focus, suggesting that correct form is crucial, thus potentially placing it above a Beginner level. The inclusion of 'Drive' often implies Intermediate complexity, but given the context and the advanced user requirement, it also leans towards Advanced.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity level is 3 out of 3, which indicates it is highly demanding. While the duration is short (1 minute, 45 seconds), the requirement of max effort rowing with a high rhythm substantially increases the effort needed. The power row and Drive format indicate significant energy expenditure in a short time span, classifying it between Challenging and Extreme effort.",
