  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This is a 10-minute foam rolling session, predominantly for warm-up or recovery, suggesting very low energy expenditure. This aligns closely with the 'Light' classification, as the session is neither intense nor lengthy. The lack of vigorous movement supports a Light intensity with a small possibility of being moderately challenging for those with very low fitness levels.",
