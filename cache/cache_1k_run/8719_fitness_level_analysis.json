  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "At 10 minutes and 43 seconds, this workout is relatively short in duration, contributing to a lower energy expenditure. While incorporating a rowing interval and circuit format suggests moderate exertion, the brevity of the session and equipment usage keep it aligned with Moderate effort difficulty. Thus, Moderate receives a stronger emphasis than Light due to the presence of both dumbbell exercises and rowing.",
