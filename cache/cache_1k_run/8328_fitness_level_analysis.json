  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a short duration (5 minutes 38 seconds), which typically correlates with a lower energy expenditure, especially given its classification as a warm-up. Additionally, warm-ups generally focus on preparing the body through low-intensity activities. These details suggest a Light Effort Difficulty, strongly supported by the brief and preparatory nature of the workout (0.9), while the rhythm component moderately contributes to a slightly challenging pace, justifying a weaker association with Moderate Effort Difficulty (0.4).",
