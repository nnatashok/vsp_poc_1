  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 10-minute duration with a focus on dynamic mobility exercises suggests a low energy expenditure, suitable for thorough warm-up, indicating a 'Light' effort difficulty. This aligns with the Beginner and Intermediate fitness levels. The nature of a 'mobility' workout implies gentle, sustained movement rather than high-intensity exercise, supporting a light classification with some moderate aspects due to the warm-up nature possibly raising heart rates slightly for some users.",
