  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Total Body Circuit' workout features a high-energy 20-minute routine, which suits 'The Warrior Workout' vibe due to the dynamic style and intense exercises like AMRAP blocks with banded side squats and uneven push-ups, scoring a 0.7. The Circuit format itself and exercises like walkout planks and glute bridges add elements of unpredictability and continued challenge, aligning with 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe, scoring a 0.6. The music is primarily 00s Hip Hop and Global Hits, which provides a strong rhythm and dynamic beat, suggesting a 'Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, scoring 0.5. The confidence level is 0.75, based on the structured intensity of the workout and musical accompaniment, though there is some ambiguity without explicit musical description."
