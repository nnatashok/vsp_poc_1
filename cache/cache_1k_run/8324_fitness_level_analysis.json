Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 20 minutes long, a typical duration for moderate intensity. This indicates a sustained effort, possibly incorporating continuous movements that elevate heart rate but remain manageable for less fit users. The energetic music playlist implies a brisk pace, further suggesting moderate effort. The emphasis on 'bodyweight strength' suggests some taxing elements, justifying a slight challenging classification, especially as no rest periods are mentioned.",
