  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 20-minute EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute) circuit, which involves both dumbbells and rowing intervals. The presence of 90-second rowing intervals suggests a steady effort, and the use of dumbbells increases energy expenditure, leading to a Challenging level for users with low fitness. The shorter duration of just over 20 minutes makes it less daunting but still beyond Light effort, thus moderately fitting the Moderate effort classification.",
