Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This workout's effort difficulty is primarily driven by its 20-minute circuit format, EMOM structure, and inclusion of both Hydrow intervals and dumbbell exercises. Although it's under 30 minutes, the workout features intervals with dumbbells and rowing, enhancing its intensity. The EMOM style with 90-second intervals increases overall exertion, making it moderately demanding (0.7). The additional element of resistance training suggests a secondary 'Challenging' level (0.3) for deconditioned users.",
