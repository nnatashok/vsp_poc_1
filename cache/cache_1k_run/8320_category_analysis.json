  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as high-intensity intervals, which directly aligns with the 'HIIT' category, making it a strong match. The mention of 'racing the Royal Canadian Henley' further supports HIIT, as it implies a focus on competitive, high-effort rowing. The format is specifically stated as 'HIIT', contributing to a very high confidence (score: 0.85) for this category.\n\nAdditionally, the workout name 'Prepare for Race Day Row', along with tags such as 'row' and 'drive', clearly indicate that it involves rowing on a machine or ergometer. This supports a high confidence for 'Indoor rowing' (score: 0.8), as the setting is consistent with indoor rowing workouts focused on racing preparation.\n\nOther categories like 'Weight workout', 'Elliptical', or 'Pilates' are excluded because no evidence from the metadata suggests elements other than those typical of HIIT and rowing workouts."
