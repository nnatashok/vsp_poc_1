  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Steady Cool-Down' is explicitly described as a 'cool down' session, indicating a focus on recovery and relaxation, which aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe (score: 0.8). The emphasis on steady rowing at low rhythms further supports this classification, as it suggests gentle, restorative movement. The description also mentions a 'steady rhythm,' enhancing the case for 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, characterized by repetitive and calming exercise (score: 0.7).\n\nThe use of low beat pop tracks like 'Roll To Me' and 'All For You' further implies a soothing and relaxed session, supporting 'The Zen Flow' vibe (score: 0.6), which includes gentle and breath-centered activities. The duration and lack of intense activity reduce the likelihood of other high-intensity vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.' The overall descriptors indicate a low-intensity, rhythmical, and calming workout, fitting these selected vibes well."
