  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of approximately 20 minutes of continuous lower body exercises indicates a sustained moderate effort level, particularly suitable for beginners to intermediates looking to improve cardiovascular and muscular endurance. The lack of specified rest intervals and use of bodyweight suggests a light-to-moderate energy demand, aligning with a moderate effort classification. The rapid transition between exercises in a bodyweight context can elevate this to challenging for deconditioned users.",
