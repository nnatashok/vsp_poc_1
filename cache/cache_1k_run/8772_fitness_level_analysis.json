  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'drive' type, which according to Hydrow rules is categorized as Advanced due to its technical demands. Although rowing workouts are usually lower in technique difficulty, the 'drive' categorization elevates this to Advanced indicating a need for solid rowing technique and experience with complex, high-intensity intervals. However, there is a moderate alignment with Intermediate due to the inherent nature of rowing not being overly complex for those familiar with basic techniques.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is a HIIT format with a high maximum rhythm of 34 strokes per minute, sustaining a high-intensity effort, with an intensity level rated as 3 out of 3. The short duration of 11:25 minutes suggests high effort is condensed into a brief period, typical of Extreme effort difficulty. Strong indicators suggest significant energy expenditure and cardiovascular demand, with some overlap to Challenging due to workout length.",
