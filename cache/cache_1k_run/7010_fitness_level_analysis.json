Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short, just over 11 minutes, which suggests a lower energy expenditure overall. However, the description of a 'brisk flow' with upbeat music indicates a pace that could increase the intensity level to a degree that feels moderate to challenging, particularly if rest periods are minimized and poses are transitioned quickly. This supports a Moderate difficulty classification with some aspects being Challenging, especially for less fit users.",
