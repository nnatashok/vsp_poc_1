  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort level of this yoga workout is predicted to be moderate to challenging based on its short duration of 11 minutes partnered with a description of a 'brisk flow.' This suggests a moderate pace and continuity, which can be demanding for beginners or those not accustomed to sustained activity. However, since it's not explicitly intense or prolonged, it does not reach the extreme category.",
