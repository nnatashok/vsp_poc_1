  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' demands a higher coordination level, influenced by its high-intensity interval format (HIIT), which requires maintaining proper rowing form under fatigue. Olympian Aquil's involvement as an instructor implies complex coaching, increasing technical demands. Despite the 'row' category typically suggesting a 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate' difficulty, the 'Drive' subcategory warrants an 'Advanced' classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's short but intense duration (11:25 minutes) with high-intensity intervals of 30 and 60 seconds signals a 'Challenging' effort level. Intensity level 3 out of 3 confirms maximum exertion within this timeframe, aligning with 'Challenging.' 'Drive' also implies peak output levels, reinforcing a need for significant stamina and effort.",
