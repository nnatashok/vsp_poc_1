  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is just over 10 minutes long and involves stretching and mobility exercises which are generally low intensity and designed for recovery, aligning well with a 'Light' effort difficulty classification. The focus on recovery indicates minimal energy expenditure. However, given Pete's background and the potential optional use of a resistance band, some users might experience a 'Moderate' effort if they choose to incorporate the band into their session, although this would not be characteristic of the primary goal of the session.",
