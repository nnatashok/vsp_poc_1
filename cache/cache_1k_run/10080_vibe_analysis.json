  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video 'One Stroke at a Time Row' with Mac Evans is best classified as 'The Zen Flow' with a high confidence level. The description emphasizes focusing on being present with a slow rhythm cap that encourages mindfulness and breath-centered movement, which aligns well with 'The Zen Flow'. Additionally, the workout type 'breathe', and the fact that it's a beginner level with low intensity, further supports this classification, leading to a score of 0.9 for 'The Zen Flow'. \n\nThe 'Meditative Grind' vibe is also a strong candidate, as the repetition of rowing and the instructor's focus on team energy and support suggest a meditative experience, knocking a score of 0.8. \n\nFinally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is somewhat applicable due to the rhythmic, steady flow of rowing and positive, supportive team energy provided by the instructor, earning it a 0.7. The lack of intense or explosive elements ruled out vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter'. Overall, all vibes chosen reflect the calm, present-focused atmosphere of the workout."
