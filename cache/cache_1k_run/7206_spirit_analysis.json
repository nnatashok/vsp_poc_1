  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Earth Day Row' workout is primarily classified as \"Outdoor & Adventure\" with a score of 1.0, given that the rowing session is conducted outdoors on water, which is a central element of this spirit. The title \"Earth Day\" also suggests a connection with nature, strengthening this classification. The second spirit \"High-Energy & Intense\" is assigned a score of 0.7, inferred from the workout involving '4-minute intervals' and a max rhythm of 28 strokes per minute, indicating a vigorous and intense session. The intensity level (2 out of 3) and the 'sweat' category further underline the high-energy aspect. The Dance and Global Hits music used adds to the energetic feel. Other spirits such as \"Flow & Rhythm\" could be considered due to the rhythm component, but the explicit focus on intensity and outdoor setting makes the chosen spirits more suitable."
