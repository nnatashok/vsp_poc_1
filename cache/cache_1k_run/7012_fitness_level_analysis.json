  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as a 'steady row', indicating a consistent, moderate pace. Hydrow's guidelines specify that rowing workouts can only be Beginner or Intermediate in Technique Difficulty. Given the emphasis on a steady rhythm and Mike's focus on community, it suggests a simple, beginner-friendly approach. Thus, Beginner scores highly, while there is mild relevance for Intermediate due to the paced structure.",
