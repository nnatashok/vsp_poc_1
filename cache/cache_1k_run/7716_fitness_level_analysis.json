  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and 'drive,' where rowing movements typically align with Beginner to Intermediate technical difficulty. However, the 'drive' tag often indicates a higher complexity, justified by the fact that it requires the user to exert 'max pressure' during intervals. Hence, a higher score towards Intermediate is given, but partial overlap with Beginner remains due to the rowing category's fundamental movement structure.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The HIIT nature and 'drive' classification of the workout, combined with an 'intensity level: 3 out of 3,' suggests significant physical demands, aligning with a Challenging to Extreme effort level. The presence of 1-minute high exertion intervals, juxtaposed with short recovery, drives the effort difficulty towards Extreme, but the manageable duration (11 minutes) tempers it slightly, creating a strong Challenging score with partial overlap into Extreme.",
