  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video, titled 'Technique Cool-Down', explicitly indicates rowing-related activities through terms like 'body over', 'stroke', and 'cool down', signaling that this is an indoor rowing session, hence the primary classification as 'Indoor rowing' with a very high confidence (0.9). The description focuses on 'control' and 'pausing', highlighting a lower intensity technique exercise, suitable for the end of a workout, which could justify a secondary classification as 'Stretching', given the nature of cool downs often involving stretching exercises, awarded a moderate presence (0.5). Despite the relaxed nature, this shouldn't be confused with Meditation or Yoga due to the rowing focus."
