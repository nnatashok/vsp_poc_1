  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Indoor rowing' with very high confidence because the description and category clearly specify rowing activities, with mentions like 'row with Laine' and 'steady row'. The format 'Steady' and the explicit inclusion of 'row' further reinforce this classification. The term 'cool down' indicates lower intensity, but this doesn't shift the primary focus away from rowing. There's no indication of activities aligning with any other categories such as Mat, Stretching, or Yoga. Music genre and playlist information do not alter the categorization due to lack of specific relevance to other workout categories."
