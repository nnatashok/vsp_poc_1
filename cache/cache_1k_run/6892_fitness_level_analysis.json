  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which inherently limits technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate as per guidelines. However, the focus on core engagement and hip pivot indicates a slightly higher complexity typical of rowing drills, aligning closer with Intermediate. The mention of a technique format further supports this, as it suggests attention to form, lifting the scoring towards Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is approximately 21 minutes with a moderate max rhythm of 28, which suggests a reasonably sustained effort but not excessively high. The metadata describes the intensity as level 2 out of 3, indicating it's designed to be more than just a light engagement. Thus, there's strong alignment with Moderate difficulty, but the potential challenging core engagement nudges some scoring towards Challenging effort as well.",
