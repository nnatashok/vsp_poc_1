  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe of this workout, titled \"Memorial Day Row,\" is primarily reflective and steady given its purpose of honoring U.S. military personnel. The setting on the Charles River aligns with 'The Nature Flow' vibe, due to the outdoor, scenic environment, but it scores lower (0.4) as the focus is more on rhythm and repetition. The 'The Meditative Grind' vibe fits strongly (0.8) with the workout's emphasis on steady rowing and the max rhythm of 22, encouraging a repetitive pattern ideal for zoning in. The 'Zen Flow' scores 0.6, signifying a lower-intensity, intentional pace supported by songs like \"Home\" which offer a grounding element to the experience. The workout's intensity level is low (1 out of 3), adding to the calming, methodical nature typical of a meditative or zen-like grind."
