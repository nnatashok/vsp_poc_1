  "vibesExplanation": "The workout focuses on 'simple stretches' to 'release tension and stiffness', suggesting a vibe of relaxation and gentle movement. 'The Reboot Workout' was chosen as a primary vibe because the aim is to refresh and release tension, fitting the vibe of 'deep stretch, low stress'. The score of 0.75 reflects strong indicators of this vibe.\n\n'Comfort Moves' is a secondary match since the workout provides 'simple stretches' that naturally imply a safe, accessible experience, which is comforting. A score of 0.65 indicates a strong match.\n\nLastly, 'The Groove Session' was considered due to the upbeat music like 'No Lie' and 'Shivers' which adds an element of fun and lightheartedness, warranting a score of 0.5 for its noticeable presence. \n\n'Zen Flow' was excluded as the upbeat music diverges from the calming and meditative nature typical of this vibe. The confidence level is set at 0.75 due to the clear indicators from the description and music choice."
