Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 20 minutes indicates a short, potentially low-impact session. Pilates, especially at a foundational level, typically involves low-to-moderate intensity exercises focusing on flexibility and core engagement rather than high energy expenditure. Therefore, the effort difficulty aligns strongly with Light (0.8) given its suitability for beginners and low-intensity nature, with a weak to moderate alignment with Moderate (0.3) considering the potential engagement of core muscles and minor cardiovascular benefit.",
