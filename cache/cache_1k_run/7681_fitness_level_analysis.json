  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically limits Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The format includes climbing sets of 'ladders,' but the activity is done on a rowing machine, which inherently simplifies coordination demands compared to exercises off the machine. The lack of an instructor may slightly raise the complexity, so while Beginner is strongly aligned (score: 0.9), Intermediate has a moderate association due to self-guidance needed (score: 0.6).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts for approximately 21 minutes, and is described with a breathing focus and intensity level 1 out of 3, suggesting low energy expenditure. However, the 'climb' and max rhythm of 24 could pose minor challenges for some deconditioned users, warranting a moderate score as a secondary consideration. Thus, it leans towards Light (score: 0.8) with some alignment to Moderate (score: 0.5).",
