  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'drive,' which according to Hydrow-specific rules, aligns with 'Advanced' technique difficulty. However, since this is a rowing workout (category includes 'row'), the technique difficulty is adjusted. Rowing generally requires maintaining basic form, making it less technically complex. Given the format of interval training with changes in rhythm, there is a need for coordination, suggesting an intermediate difficulty for those aspects, but overall, the movements remain fundamental to rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The race format, interval training with alternating rhythms, inherently elevates the exertion level. With a max rhythm of 30+ and a workout labeled 'drive' with the highest intensity (3 out of 3), it involves bursts of high energy expenditure, especially given the two intensity levels (28 and 30) broken by shorter rest periods. The duration of approximately 17 minutes focuses on high performance, making it more challenging for users who are less conditioned.",
