  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'row', which typically suggests Beginner to Intermediate Technique Difficulty. The instruction to \"climb up in rhythm with Mike\" may require some balance and coordination, aligning partially with Intermediate. However, as rowing is generally straightforward, this results in a score of 0.6 for Beginner and 0.4 for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The interval workout format (two 4-minute intervals) and duration of 11 minutes suggest a moderate level of physical exertion, as intervals inherently increase intensity and effort. The max rhythm of 28 with a 'sweat' category implies potential for higher effort, aligning somewhat with Challenging. However, the overall intensity of 2/3 indicates a more Moderate effort, scored at 0.7 for Moderate and 0.3 for Challenging.",
