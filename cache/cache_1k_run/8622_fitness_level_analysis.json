Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of only 5 minutes and 47 seconds, combined with the 'cool down' emphasis, suggest very low physical demand, aligning strongly with the Light level. The music genre and rhythm could marginally increase energy but not significantly, thus a partial Moderate scoring is justifiable but minimal.",
