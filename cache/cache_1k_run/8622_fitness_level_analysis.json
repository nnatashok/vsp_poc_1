  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Relaxed Hands Cool-Down', and is classified under both 'cool down' and 'steady'. These elements suggest a low-energy expenditure activity, confirmed by the short duration of 5:47 minutes. Additionally, rowing with a low rhythm of 20 implies a gentle pace, aligning with Light effort difficulty very strongly. The secondary potential for Moderate effort is minimal, mainly due to the rhythmic nature of rowing, which can still demand some energy for complete beginners.",
