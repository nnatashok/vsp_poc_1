Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short at 10:42 minutes, suggesting lower endurance requirements, which aligns with Light effort. However, focusing on upper body strength and incorporating resistance may moderately increase the energy expenditure compared to an entirely static routine. Therefore, the effort aligns primarily with Light and partially with Moderate intensity.",
