  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is short, at just over 10 minutes, which decreases overall physical demand. However, strength workouts utilizing resistance can increase intensity. Since the music genre implies a dynamic session and resistance bands are used, moderate effort is required, aligning with fitness levels for beginners and intermediates. A short duration with strength focus suggests moderate difficulty with potential for a challenging classification due to resistance components.",
