  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Guided Row: Steady Speed' is characterized by a steady pace and a scenic view of Lake Lucerne, indicating a vibe focused on endurance and repetitive movement. This aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind,' scoring 0.7, due to the steady rhythm and endurance focus. The lack of an instructor and the focus on pacing contribute to a meditative quality.\n\nThe 'Zen Flow' vibe, scoring 0.6, is supported by the calm nature of the workout and its focus on navigation and rhythm rather than intensity or explosiveness. The choice of an indie and global hits playlist, including songs by artists like Lorde and Imagine Dragons, adds a calming yet engaging atmosphere.\n\n'Nature Flow' is another relevant vibe, scoring 0.6, given the outdoor lake setting and journey-style experience. This combination of outdoor rowing and scenic imagery evokes a sense of connection with nature, enhancing the immersive quality of the session.\n\nOther vibes such as 'The Competitor' or 'The Warrior Workout' were excluded due to the lack of intense elements, competitive aspects, or high-energy music, focusing more on a relaxed, steady, and nature-connected experience."
