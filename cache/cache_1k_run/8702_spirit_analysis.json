  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Hip Mobility' emphasizes improving hip function through exercises that are typically smooth and focused, aligning well with a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The use of lively music like Latin and Global Hits supports this interpretation, as it likely enhances the continuous movement patterns (score: 0.7). Meanwhile, the description also highlights hip mobility improvement and a lack of additional equipment, indicating a focus on recovery and flexibility, which is central to a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit (score: 0.8). The environment shown in the image does not strongly emphasize outdoor adventure, but there's some suggestion of exploration of movements in a distinctive setting, mildly reflecting an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.5). Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the workout's gentle, mobility-focused nature."
