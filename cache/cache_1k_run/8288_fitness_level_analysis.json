  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified with a high confidence as Intermediate for technique difficulty, based on the metadata indicating it's a rowing-based HIIT session. Row-based workouts inherently fit Beginner or Intermediate levels. The drive format used suggests elevated complexity, however, within the rowing spectrum under the 'Hydrow' guideline this maxes out at Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is rated Challenging to Extreme for effort difficulty based on the metadata: a 21-minute high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format with a max rhythm of 30. The effort intensity is further confirmed by the platform's highest intensity rating of 3/3 and the vigorous nature of HIIT workouts, implying significant exertion and energy expenditure consistent with high-effort levels.",
