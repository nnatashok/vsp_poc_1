  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled \"Looking After Yourself Cool-Down,\" strongly focuses on relaxation and self-care, indicative of a \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit. The description emphasizes a steady cool-down, aligning with recovery and stress reduction, which justifies a high score of 0.9. The category and workout type further reinforce this as a cooldown session.\n\nGiven the imagery of rowing on a river, as shown in the image, an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is also relevant, though to a lesser extent due to the session\u2019s intended calming nature. Thus, it receives a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nThe workout lacks elements of intensity, structure, and sports-specific agility, leading to the exclusion of other spirits. The focus on indie and alternative music, paired with the calm activity, supports a tranquil and restorative ambiance."
