  "categoriesExplanation": "This workout is best classified as 'Indoor rowing' due to several explicit indicators in the metadata. The workout name 'Legs + Core Row' clearly suggests a focus on rowing exercises. Furthermore, the description mentions 'legs-only progressions,' which are common in rowing workouts designed to improve technique and form. The use of 'Max rhythm: 28' also suggests a rowing cadence, reinforcing this category. While no explicit mention of equipment such as a rowing machine is made, the context strongly implies its use. There is a high confidence level assigned to 'Indoor rowing,' given the strong consistency of rowing jargon and indicators in the metadata. Other categories such as 'Mat' were considered but excluded due to the workout's emphasis on rowing technique rather than general floor exercises or body movements without equipment."
