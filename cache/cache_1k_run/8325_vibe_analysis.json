  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Piece by Piece Row' is structured around interval rowing, focusing on 'challenging efforts one minute at a time,' which aligns with the ongoing effort typical of 'The Meditative Grind.' This is further supported by the focus on 'mental skills strategy,' suggesting a repetitive and mentally engaging activity (confidence score 0.8).\n\nAdditionally, the playlist featuring upbeat songs like 'Poker Face' and 'Good Time' promotes a positive, feel-good atmosphere, contributing to 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe. The use of global hits and pop music adds to the energetic and motivational environment, enhancing this vibe (confidence score 0.7).\n\nThe intensity level 3 out of 3 and the short duration of 21 minutes point towards a concentrated burst of activity, yet the recurring interval format keeps it more aligned with endurance and focus rather than high intensity or adrenaline-pumping workouts, excluding vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.'"
