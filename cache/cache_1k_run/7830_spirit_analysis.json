  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Climbing Intervals Row\" and described as focusing on technique with intervals increasing in rhythm. This signifies a \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit due to methodical progression and technical precision (score: 0.7). The format 'Climb' and an increasing rhythm suggests a connection to \"Flow & Rhythm,\" aligning movement with music-driven pacing (score: 0.6). The music selection, including Latin and Global Hits, supports this musical connection. Additionally, the image shows the session occurring outdoors on a river, fitting the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit due to the natural setting and exploration element (score: 0.8). The intensity level 2 out of 3 and short duration point towards a controlled, yet engaging session. Other spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Soothing & Restorative\" are less applicable due to the workout's balanced intensity and focus on climbing and technique."
