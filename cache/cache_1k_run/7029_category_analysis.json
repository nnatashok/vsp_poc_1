  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is titled 'Post-Row Stretch' and described as a session for stretching after a rowing workout, which strongly indicates that the primary focus is on flexibility training. Although 'rowing' is mentioned, it explicitly refers to an activity completed prior to this session, underscoring the distinction between the rowing and the stretching components. The description includes 'stretching your hips,' which aligns with the Stretching category. The metadata specifies the workout type as 'stretching,' further confirming this classification. The mention of 'On The Mat' as a category suggests the exercises are performed on a mat, supporting a supplementary classification as a Mat workout. However, the primary emphasis and explicit indication of stretching justify higher confidence and score for the Stretching category. Other categories like Body weight or Yoga are not applicable due to lack of corresponding focus or activities. The music information and playlist do not substantially alter the classification as they are common across various workout types."
