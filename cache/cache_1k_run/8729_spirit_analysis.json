  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Change Your Narrative Row' takes place in Newport Beach with a focus on moving through 'three pyramids,' indicating a structured but rhythmic approach. The use of terms like 'breathe' and the low 'intensity level' of 1 out of 3 suggests a gentle and restorative pace. This aligns well with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as does the music selection of indie and global hits which provide a calming atmosphere.\n\nThe inclusion of rowing in Newport Beach strongly aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the natural setting and exploration element, scoring very high confidence in this category.\n\nThe mention of rhythms and a max rhythm of 26, along with varied musical genres, contributes to a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, as it promotes continuous movement and mind-body connection.\n\nThe structured 'pyramid' format adds a degree of 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, but given the workout's overall soothing and outdoor focus, it is a secondary aspect."
