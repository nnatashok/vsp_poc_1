  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout named 'Core Burn Express' is described as a Pilates session on the mat. Keywords such as 'On The Mat' and 'Pilates' strongly suggest the need for a mat to perform the exercises comfortably and safely, leading to a very high confidence score of 0.9. The image associated with the workout shows a person on a mat, providing visual confirmation of its use. While a thick towel or blanket is mentioned in the notes, it implies cushioning support similar to a mat. Thus, the mat is essential for this workout."
