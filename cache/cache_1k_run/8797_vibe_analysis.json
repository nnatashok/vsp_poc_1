  "vibesExplanation": "The workout title 'April Race: Week 1 of 4' and description indicating a race down the Brazos River suggest a competitive element, justifying 'The Competitor' vibe with a score of 0.8. The use of intervals and high-intensity rhythm (max rhythm: 30) contribute to an experience that matches 'The Endorphin Wave', particularly given the endurance nature of rowing, earning it a score of 0.6. The overall structure and duration (16:19) resonate with 'The Meditative Grind', where the repetition of rowing can promote zoning in, hence a score of 0.4. The pop and global hits indicate a lively atmosphere, supporting the selected vibes. However, lack of detailed music info, besides pop genres, limits assigning 'The Nightclub Workout'. E.g., 'explosive, short, devastating' vibes like 'The Firestarter' don't align given the length and intensity level; hence, they're not chosen. Confidence level is 0.75 due to clear evidence but some ambiguity in other potential vibes."
