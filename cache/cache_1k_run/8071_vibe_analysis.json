  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Firestarter' was chosen with high confidence (0.9) due to the short duration (1 min 44 sec) and the 'one-minute challenge for maximum meters.' The workout description emphasizes explosive effort and rhythm increases, which align with fast, electrifying vibes. 'The Competitor' fits well (0.8) given the gamified nature of maximizing meters in a short timeframe, suggesting competitive, full-send energy. 'The Adrenaline Rush' is included (0.75) because of the high intensity (level 3 out of 3) and the high-octane, heart-racing format implied by rapid rhythm changes and challenging effort in a condensed timeframe. Indie Alternative and Global Hits music, along with 'Stronger' by The Score, add to the energetic and driven atmosphere, boosting the classification for these vibes. Other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' were excluded due to the short duration and specific focus on rhythm challenges rather than broad, primal energy."
