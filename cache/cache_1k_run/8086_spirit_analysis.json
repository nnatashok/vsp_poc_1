  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout should be classified primarily as 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the setting: rowing in the Alaskan mountains, which leverages the natural landscape. This environment suggests exploration and immersion in nature, which aligns with an adventure spirit. The confidence level is high (score: 0.9) because the title 'Adventure Row' and the visual imagery strongly support this classification.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is the secondary spirit due to the emphasis on maintaining a consistent rhythm or split during the rowing session. The music, consisting of low-key pop and reprise versions, aligns with a rhythmic, flowing pace (score: 0.6).\n\n'Soothing & Restorative' is also relevant, considering the low intensity (1 out of 3) and the description mentioning 'breathe' type. The calming landscape and music may further promote a gentle, restorative vibe, warranting a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the moderate pace and lack of highly structured progression."
