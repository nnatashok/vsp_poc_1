  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts approximately 15 minutes, which is a relatively short duration contributing to a low-effort requirement. Pilates often includes controlled movements and moderate pace, which combined with a short session suggests Light effort. However, engaging the core could mildly elevate the effort to a Moderate level for very deconditioned users. Therefore, both Light and Moderate effort levels are applicable but with stronger alignment to Light.",
