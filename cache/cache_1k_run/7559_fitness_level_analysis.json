  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is approximately 15 minutes, which is relatively short, suggesting a 'Light' intensity. Pilates for beginners often involves engaging core muscles rather than high energy expenditure exercises, supporting a 'Light' effort rating. 'Moderate' is also considered due to the potential demand in maintaining core engagement for the duration, but evidence strongly aligns more with 'Light.'",
