  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Express Bodyweight Strength,' suggesting a focus on exercises performed using one's own body weight. The category 'On The Mat' and 'on-the-mat' further reinforces the use of a mat for floor exercises, hence the identification of 'Mat' as required equipment with very high confidence (0.8). The image shows an individual on what appears to be a mat, supporting this inference. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata, indicating this is likely a bodyweight-only workout emphasizing mat use for comfort and support during various exercises."
