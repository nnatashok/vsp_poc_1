  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is best classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the setting on the New Meadows River in Maine, explicitly noted in the description, aligning it with a nature-based workout spirit. Hence, an Outdoor & Adventure spirit scores a strong 0.8 as the workout fully embodies this environment-focused aspect. 'Structured & Disciplined' is also prevalent as the workout adheres to a specific rhythm of 26 strokes per minute over 3-minute intervals, indicating a methodical and precise approach; this spirit is assigned a score of 0.7. Additionally, the rhythm of 26 and the progression through intervals also introduce a 'Flow & Rhythm' aspect, underpinned by coordinated movement and music influencing pacing, scoring 0.6. The workout's intensity level at 2 out of 3 suggests moderate to high exertion, but does not reach the peak requirements for 'High-Energy & Intense'. Furthermore, the humorous and team-oriented approach of Mac Evans contributes to an energetic and enjoyable atmosphere, somewhat supporting Flow & Rhythm, but does not overshadow the primary spirits identified."
