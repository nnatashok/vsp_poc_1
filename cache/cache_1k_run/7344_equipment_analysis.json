  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row,' which directly implies the use of a rowing machine. The description and type ('Highs and Lows Row' and 'sweat') strongly indicate an indoor rowing workout characterized by rhythmic phases and sprints. There's no alternative equipment mentioned, reinforcing the focus on rowing. The confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high (1.0) as the term 'row' appears in both the name and category of the workout, making it central to the session."
