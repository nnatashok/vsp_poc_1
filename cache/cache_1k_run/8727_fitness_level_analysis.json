Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is only 11 minutes and 18 seconds, which is quite short, implying a light energy expenditure. The focus on balance suggests some muscle engagement, thus slightly raising the effort level above purely 'Light'. However, because the music is chill and downtempo, indicating a relaxed pace, and no intense physical exertion or equipment is required, the main effort remains 'Light'. A small portion of 'Moderate' effort is considered due to potential physical challenge of sustaining balancing poses.",
