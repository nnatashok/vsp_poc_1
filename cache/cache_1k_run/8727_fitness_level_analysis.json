Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 11-minute duration and the yoga-based theme imply a session that is not overly exertive. The balance practice can be seen as gentle, focusing more on control than cardio intensity. Given the music genre is chill/cool, it also suggests a less intense workout environment. Consequently, the workout aligns more with the Light intensity but can still moderately challenge inactive users, hence the scoring.",
