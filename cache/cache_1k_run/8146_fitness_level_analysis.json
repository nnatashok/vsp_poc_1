  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's primary category is 'row', which typically involves mechanics that are straightforward, emphasizing rhythm and endurance. The description focuses on technique development at a steady pace of 20 to 24 SPM, which fits within the Beginner level's simple movement framework. There might be some slight coordination involved, typical of an Intermediate level, due to maintaining form over an extended duration, but primarily it aligns with Beginner technique. Hence, Beginner is rated highest with a slight note on possible Intermediate aspects.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Effort difficulty is primarily 'Light' as the workout intensity level is stated as 1 out of 3, indicating minimal physical demand. The duration is relatively short at 16 minutes, with pacing described as steady, and stroke rate capped at 24 SPM, reinforcing the Light categorization. However, maintaining a steady rhythm might require some effort for very deconditioned users, warranting a secondary Moderate level score.",
