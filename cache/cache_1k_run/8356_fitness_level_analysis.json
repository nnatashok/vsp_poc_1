  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is a 15-minute stretching workout, indicating minimal physical exertion and a focus on relaxing the muscles rather than cardiovascular or strength challenges. The use of a resistance band could add mild intensity to stretching but not enough to exceed a light effort classification. The relaxing nature of the described session is consistent with low energy expenditure overall, suitable for deconditioned users.",
