  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'warm-up' with a duration of 5:51, which typically implies a lower level of effort. This effort level is further supported by the 'warm-up' label, targeting preparations for more intense activities, indicating minimal energy expenditure is needed overall. Thus, the effort mechanisms point to a Light classification, suitable for preparing the body without undue strain, fitting within the lower intensity tier of Light.",
