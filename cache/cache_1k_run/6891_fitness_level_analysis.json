  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty of this workout is classified as Advanced due to the 'drive' workout type, which indicates a higher complexity similar to advanced rowing techniques that require good coordination and body awareness. Additionally, the inclusion of high-intensity intervals (HIIT) and a focus on proper form demanding advanced technique skills contribute to this rating.",
