  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'row' type as indicated by the category and name, which suggests a technique difficulty that ranges from Beginner to Intermediate. The presence of the \"Drive\" format implies more intensity and focus on powerful strokes, aligning better with Intermediate. However, the rowing movements are fundamental, thus offering a 0.3 score for Beginner and a 0.7 for Intermediate due to the Drive classification and focus on HIIT rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes HIIT intervals and the highest intensity level of 3, which indicates a formidable energy demand that aligns with higher effort levels. The 15-second high-intensity intervals at a max rhythm of 32 make it inherently Challenging, corresponding to the short rest associated with HIIT. The short duration (11 minutes) with intense Drive promotion gives Extreme considerations since users push near-max efforts, contributing to ratings of 0.7 for Challenging and 0.6 for Extreme.",
