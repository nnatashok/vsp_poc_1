  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified under several spirits due to its unique characteristics. The 'Cardio Cruise Row' is conducted on a river, immediately fitting the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit with a high confidence score of 0.8. This is corroborated by the outdoor setting depicted in the image. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is strongly indicated by the emphasis on music and rhythm, with an interval format that suggests a paced and coordinated movement. The selection of classic rock music from the 60s and 70s, known for its melodic quality, also contributes to this classification, earning it a score of 0.75. The workout's description indicates a low intensity with a focus on breathing ('breathe' category) and intention, aligning well with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, thus receiving a score of 0.7. The overall low intensity level and focus on breathing reinforce a more calming and mindful approach rather than high-energy or highly structured training."
