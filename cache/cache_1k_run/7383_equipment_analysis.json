  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata indicates that the workout is a 'Sprint + Max Interval Row,' with the category explicitly stating 'row.' This suggests a high-intensity rowing workout. The term 'max pace for 2-minute and 1-minute intervals' implies the use of a rowing machine to perform interval training. Given the 'row' category type, the classification must include 'Rowing machine' with very high confidence, set at 1.0. Additionally, the attached image shows a person rowing, further reinforcing the need for rowing equipment. No other equipment is mentioned or suggested in the metadata."
