  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video's title, 'Essential Stretches for Your Back,' and description clearly indicate a focus on flexibility exercises specifically for the back, establishing 'Stretching' as a primary category. The presence of everyday stretches further corroborates this, warranting a high confidence level of 0.9 for the 'Stretching' category due to its prominent presence. Meanwhile, the mention of 'On The Mat' in both the 'Category' section and the description implies exercises performed while positioned on a mat, aligning with the 'Mat' category, thereby scoring it a 0.7 given its secondary yet relevant mention. The absence of any specific equipment and the informal music choices (Indie Alternative, Global Hits) suggest a relaxed session, supporting a mat-based classification. No indicators for other potential categories like 'Yoga' or 'Pilates' were evident, ensuring an appropriate classification within 'Stretching' and 'Mat.'"
