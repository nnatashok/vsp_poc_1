  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified with very high confidence as a 'Yoga' workout category, scoring 0.9. This is due to the explicit mention of 'restorative yoga' in both the workout name and description, indicating a strong focus on yoga as the primary activity. Restorative yoga is a specific type of yoga that emphasizes relaxation and mindfulness. The associated terms 'calming' and 'restorative' further emphasize the nature of the yoga practice. \n\nThe 'Meditation' category is also relevant, scoring 0.4, due to the focus on calming the body and the mind, which are integral aspects of meditation practices. The use of chill and downtempo music supports this classification as it sets a relaxing atmosphere typical for meditation sessions. \n\nOther categories such as 'Stretching' or 'Breathing exercises' were considered but excluded because the description and title strongly associate the workout with yoga, specifically its restorative nature, which implies light stretching rather than an active flexibility routine."
