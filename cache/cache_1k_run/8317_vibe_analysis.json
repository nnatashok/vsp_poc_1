  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Warrior Workout' with a score of 0.8 due to its HIIT format, high intensity level (3 out of 3), and the inclusion of 'Drive' in the workout type, which suggests a challenging and intense experience typical of this vibe. It involves heart-pounding energy and endurance as users push through intervals.\n\nSecondly, 'The Nightclub Workout' is relevant here with a score of 0.7. The playlist consists of upbeat and high-energy dance tracks, such as those by Avicii, Stromae, and Swedish House Mafia, fitting the euphoric, music-driven experience associated with workouts that make you feel like you're in a club setting.\n\nFinally, 'The Meditative Grind' scores 0.5. The rowing component suggests repetitive, endurance-building elements typical of this vibe, where methodical pacing allows one to zone in and lock down during the workout, despite the high intensity level.\n\nOverall confidence in these classifications is high due to explicit indicators in the metadata, such as music genre, workout format, and intensity level."
