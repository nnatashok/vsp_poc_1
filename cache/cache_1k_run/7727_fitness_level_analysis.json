  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically implies either a Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty. The description highlights a low-intensity session led in an 'interval' format, allowing for rest periods that decrease complexity. Rowing can be moderately complex, requiring some coordination, placing it between Beginner and Intermediate. Given the 'breathe' workout type, known for relaxed pacing, this leans more strongly towards Beginner difficulty.",

The 31-minute duration with a format type 'breathe' and 'interval' indicates moderate effort, but with consistent rests, it fits well within the Light category. The instructor's motivational background and the music theme, focusing on relaxation and enjoyment, further hint a workout that is more comfortable for those with lower fitness levels, ensuring Light to Low-Moderate alignment.",
