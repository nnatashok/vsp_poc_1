This classification is strongly supported by the focus on gratitude and cool-down, as indicated by the title 'Appreciation Cool-Down' and the description that emphasizes honoring feelings and gratitude. These elements signal a restorative and gentle session aimed at recovery and relaxation. The music genre featuring 'Indie Alternative' supports a calming atmosphere, further solidifying this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the spirit of 'Outdoor & Adventure' is included with a score of 0.7. The image indicates that the session takes place on a river, aligning with outdoor and nature-based settings. While the session itself focuses on cooldown and recovery, the outdoor setting contributes an adventurous element simply through its environment.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the session's calm nature and lack of intensity or methodical structure."
