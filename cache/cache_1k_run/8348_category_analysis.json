  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout's name, \"High Energy HIIT Row,\" clearly indicates both 'Indoor rowing' and 'HIIT' as central elements. The description mentions \"45-second intervals,\" which is a common structure in High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), confirming the intense, interval-based nature of the workout. The phrase \"drive through 45-second intervals\" and a maximum rhythm of 34 support a vigorous rowing workout. The tags include 'Drive,standard,row,' alluding to a rowing machine workout format. Furthermore, the workout intensity level is marked as '3 out of 3,' underscoring the high-intensity characteristic suitable for HIIT classification. The duration of 16 minutes and 31 seconds is typical for high-intensity interval sessions. While 'Indoor Rowing' receives the highest score due to the explicit rowing focus, HIIT is also prominent, reflected in the structured intervals and intensity level."
