  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Climbing Intervals Row' features 2-minute intervals with a rhythm component, aligning with both 'The Meditative Grind' and 'The Endorphin Wave.' The focus on rhythmic climbing and interval training suggests a meditative element through repetitive, consistent motion, earning 'The Meditative Grind' a score of 0.75. The use of upbeat pop music from artists like Jub\u00ebl and Carly Rae Jepsen enhances a feel-good, energizing atmosphere that aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave,' justifying a score of 0.7. The intensity level is moderate (2 out of 3), indicating a steady but not overwhelming workout experience. The short duration hints at a concentrated workout, typical of interval training, bolstering these classifications with high confidence (0.85). The exclusion of intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' is due to the moderate intensity and lack of extreme explosive elements in the metadata."
