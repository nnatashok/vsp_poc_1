  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Beginner Hip + Core Pilates' and categorized under 'On The Mat', which strongly indicates the use of a mat. Pilates workouts typically require a mat to perform exercises comfortably and safely, especially when floor exercises are involved. The image further supports this, as the participants are using mats. The confidence score is set at 0.95 because a mat is almost certainly needed, even though it was not explicitly mentioned in the 'Equipment' section."
