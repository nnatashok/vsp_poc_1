  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Drive', which per Hydrow-specific guidelines implies an 'Advanced' technique difficulty due to the inherently complex and coordinated nature of the drive workouts. The use of high-intensity intervals coupled with the core work on the mat suggests a need for good body control and awareness, justifying the advanced classification. The metadata clearly aligns with these elements, supporting an advanced categorization.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the description of high-intensity intervals followed by core exercises, this workout requires significant energy expenditure over a 21-minute duration. The 'Drive' component, along with the maximum rhythm of 30, points to a high effort level. Combined with a maximum intensity level of 3 out of 3, this aligns the workout more with the extreme end of effort difficulty, although it can still be considered challenging for less fit users.",
