  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes a rowing drive segment, which is typically intermediate in technique difficulty due to rowing's requirement for coordination and rhythm. The addition of a '5 Min HIIT Combo' suggests components that may elevate the difficulty slightly, introducing variability and possibly complex movements associated with HIIT training. Dani's expert technical instruction implies a need for attentiveness to form. Overall, while predominantly intermediate, there is a minority advanced component due to complexity involved in typical HIIT movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's 21:23 duration coupled with 'high intensity intervals' and an intensity rating of 3 out of 3 suggests a highly demanding workout. The inclusion of a 5-minute HIIT segment on top of the rowing drive intensifies the overall effort required. The high rhythm and use of energetic music imply sustained energy expenditure. While predominantly challenging due to the mix of cardio and core work, it borders on extreme for users with limited fitness given the high energy intervals.",
