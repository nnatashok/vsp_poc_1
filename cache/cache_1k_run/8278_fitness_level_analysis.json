Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session duration is relatively short at just over 15 minutes, reducing overall physical demand. Additionally, 'strength with bands' typically involves controlled movements with minimal rest but without high cardio intensity. This aligns with a Light effort difficulty, suitable for beginners and individuals with lower fitness levels. However, maintaining tension against a band could require some consistent effort, which justifies a slight alignment with Moderate effort.",
