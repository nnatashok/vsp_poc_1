  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is best classified as 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 0.9. The title 'Steady Cool-Down' suggests a low-intensity session, while the description explicitly mentions 'rowing steadily down the Charles River', indicating the use of a rowing machine to simulate this activity. The metadata includes tags such as 'row' and 'cool down', reinforcing the focus on rowing. Given the max rhythm of 20, which implies a controlled and steady pace, this aligns with an indoor rowing workout, particularly as a cool-down. Other categories like 'Stretching', 'Meditation', or 'Yoga' are inappropriate here, as they do not align with rowing exercises. There is high confidence (0.9) in this classification due to explicit references to rowing in the description."
