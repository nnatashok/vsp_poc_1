  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This classification is driven by the description stating 'along the Charles River' and the image showing rowing in a natural setting. The natural environment plays a significant role, indicating an adventure element. \n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is a strong secondary spirit with a score of 0.7, as indicated by the 'Format: Interval' which implies methodical training with specific intervals. The workout's focus on rhythm and intervals suggests a disciplined approach.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' fits with a moderate score of 0.6 due to the descriptors 'shift in rhythm' and the presence of music like 'Pop mid, Global Hits,' which aligns with continuity and mind-body connection. This is supported by the playlist featuring rhythmic tracks, enhancing the flow aspect of the workout.\n\nOther spirits were considered but excluded due to lack of specific indicators for high intensity, restorative focus, or specific sports skills."
