Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 20-minute duration, compounded by the AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) format, inherently increases the intensity of the workout due to its competitive element, which encourages pushing limits. The intervals between rowing and circuit exercises with dumbbells imply a moderate to challenging effort for users, especially those who are deconditioned. However, the relatively short duration tempers the intensity level somewhat, preventing it from reaching Extreme.",
