  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Low Rhythm Row' is set on the Hillsborough River, indicating a strong 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, with a score of 0.9. The outdoor setting, coupled with rowing on a natural waterway, aligns perfectly with this spirit. The emphasis on 'lower rhythms' and 'slightly higher efforts' suggests a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, given the continuous movement and focus on coordination, supported by the music-centric playlist featuring Indie Alternative and Global Hits. This spirit is scored at 0.7 due to the rhythmic nature mentioned. Lastly, the 'breathe' workout type and low intensity (1 out of 3) suggest elements of 'Soothing & Restorative,' earning it a score of 0.5. While intensity is slightly higher than typical restorative workouts, the focus on breathing and overall pacing supports some restorative qualities. Other spirits were not chosen due to the lack of high intensity, structured training protocols, or sports-specific agility work."
