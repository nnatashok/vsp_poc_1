  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short at 15:55 minutes, and it starts gently, indicating a relaxing, restorative intensity suitable for beginners or those easing into exercise. The music choice (chill and downtempo) implies a low-energy, nurturing atmosphere, consistent with a 'Light' effort difficulty. The mention of more intense backbends introduces a minimal element of 'Moderate' effort, but given the context (easing in gently), it's likely not a predominant aspect of the workout.",
