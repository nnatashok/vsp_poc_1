Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is short (approximately 16 minutes), and backbends and alignment-focused workouts typically emphasize stretching and positioning over cardio or resistance training. The playlist is chill and downtempo, which aligns with a workout designed for relaxation over high energy exertion. Terms like 'gently' suggest a low-intensity session primarily focused on flexibility rather than strength or endurance. Thus, there is very strong alignment with Light effort difficulty (0.8) while Moderate (0.5) is somewhat fitting as engaging in stretching can offer a moderate level of exertion, especially for deconditioned individuals.",
