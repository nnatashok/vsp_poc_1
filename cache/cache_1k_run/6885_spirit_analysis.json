  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the description mentioning 'high intensity intervals' and a maximum rhythm of 32, alongside being labeled under 'Drive.' The intensity level is 3 out of 3, which indicates a demanding session focused on pushing limits. These elements strongly support a high-energy classification, leading to a score of 0.8.\n\nThe workout also falls under 'Outdoor & Adventure,' supported by the image showing the session taking place on water. Rowing in natural settings aligns with the outdoor and exploration theme, justifying a score of 0.8.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' were not considered due to lack of indicators related to smooth, coordinated movement patterns or methodical progression. The music playlist with upbeat pop songs ('Party Up,' 'Larger Than Life') suggests a high-energy atmosphere, reinforcing the chosen spirits. The confidence level in this analysis is high at 0.9 due to clear metadata signals."
