  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is categorized under 'row' with a 'breathe' style, which generally indicates a focus on consistent, steady rowing pace rather than complex movement patterns. The 'breathe' category suggests a less intense focus on technical coordination, aligning with Beginner and possibly low Intermediate skill levels due to the standard use of rowing equipment. Given the inclusion of 'breathe', a classification closer to the Beginner level is more fitting, especially given the steady rhythm and minimal complexity cues.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as steady-paced with 'breathe' format indicating controlled intensity. The duration of approximately 21 minutes and a max rhythm of 24 support a Light effort level, indicative of low energy expenditure. The intensity level being 1 out of 3 further implies it's suitable for those needing a less physically demanding session. The workout remains relatively undemanding, aligning with a Light classification, with potential for low Moderate due to its slightly extended duration.",
