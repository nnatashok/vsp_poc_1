  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workoutType 'drive' typically categorizes the workout at least as Intermediate due to its engagement of full-body coordination and technical precision required for rowing at a high resistance and tempo. The 'drive' rule is a specific designation from Hydrow indicating a higher level of technique compared to a Basic tutorial. The category is listed as 'row', which allows for a maximum technique difficulty of Intermediate. Overall, the frequent changes in tempo and the high intensity suggest a moderately demanding coordination and body awareness necessary to maintain proper rowing form throughout the intervals, leading to a strong alignment with Intermediate difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as HIIT with a rhythm max of 32, indicating a high tempo and increased cardiovascular load, making it Challenging. The short sprints and high-intensity changes suggest that it demands a significant level of cardiovascular effort and muscular endurance over a relatively short 16-minute duration. A 3 out of 3 workout intensity also signals that it is towards the upper end of effort, justifying a Challenging classification with some overlap into Extreme for less fit individuals due to the intense nature of HIIT formats.",
