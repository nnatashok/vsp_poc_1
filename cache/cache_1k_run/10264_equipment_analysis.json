  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly centered around rowing, as indicated by the title 'Hydrow Games: Race Day with Aquil and Laine' and the category type 'row.' The description mentions racing on the Charles River, focusing on rowing techniques and rhythm, which directly implies the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the inclusion of an Olympian rower as an instructor adds to the focus on rowing, confirming the necessity of a rowing machine. Therefore, there is very high confidence that the equipment needed for this workout is a rowing machine."
