  "categoriesExplanation": "The video has been classified primarily as 'Yoga' with very high confidence due to several explicit indicators. The workout is titled 'Rooftop Yoga Flow', with 'Yoga' prominently mentioned in the title. The description further supports this by mentioning a 'flow', which, in yoga terminology, typically refers to a vinyasa or sequence of poses. The setting on a helipad adds a unique but not contradictory element to a yoga session. The tags in the metadata, including 'On The Mat' and 'flow', align with a standard yoga practice. Although no specific yoga instructor is mentioned, the context clearly defines this as a yoga workout. The music style, including chill and downtempo tracks, further complements a relaxing and focused yoga session. Other categories like 'Mat' could be considered but are less fitting due to the specific yoga context provided by the title and description."
