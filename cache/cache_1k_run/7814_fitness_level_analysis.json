  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 10 minutes and 45 seconds and being categorized as a 'warm-up', the workout is designed to be of lower intensity. Describing the activity as a 'gradual climb' emphasizes a slowly progressive challenge, suitable primarily for a light effort difficulty level. However, rowing can still be somewhat challenging even at low intensity, thus moderate effort receives a lower score.",
