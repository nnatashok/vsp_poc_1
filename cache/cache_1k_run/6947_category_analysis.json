  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Indoor rowing' due to several explicit indicators in the metadata. The title 'Power + Endurance Row' clearly mentions 'Row', denoting a rowing workout. The description provides further evidence by mentioning maintaining a consistent split during intervals and referencing specific rhythms (24, 26, and 28), which are common terminologies and practices associated with rowing workouts. There are no mentions of other workout types or equipment that would suggest a different category. The playlist and instructor information do not provide conflicting details, and the tags 'sweat' and 'row' reinforce the classification. Given these factors, the confidence level is very high at 0.9 for this classification."
