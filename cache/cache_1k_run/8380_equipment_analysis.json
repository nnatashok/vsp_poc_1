  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata clearly indicates that this is a rowing workout, as seen in the title \"Finding Grace in Movement Row\" and the description \"as you row with Mac.\" Additionally, the category listed is \"row,\" which strongly implies the need for a rowing machine. The image associated with the metadata supports this, showing a person engaged in rowing activity. The explicit mention of rowing and the categorization confirms a very high confidence level (1.0) that a rowing machine is the essential equipment required."
