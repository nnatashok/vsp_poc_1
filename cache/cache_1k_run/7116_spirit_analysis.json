  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Resistance Row' is primarily characterized by a high-intensity interval structure, as indicated by phrases such as \"take on high intensity intervals\" and \"increase the drag factor throughout the workout.\" It is described as a \"Drive\" format with a maximum rhythm of 32, emphasizing power and intensity, which aligns with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The music selection, including upbeat tracks like 'Dancing On Glass' and 'Alive And Kicking,' further supports an energetic atmosphere, justifying a strong score of 0.8 for this spirit.\n\nThe image showing rowing on a river suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, which is relevant due to the natural setting and rowing context. This is typical for outdoor rowing sessions, scoring a 0.7 to reflect the video\u2019s environment. The absence of detailed indoor cues in the metadata further emphasizes the outdoor aspect.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were considered but are less relevant due to the focus on intensity and outdoor setting."
