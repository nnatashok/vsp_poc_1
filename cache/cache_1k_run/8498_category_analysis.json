  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily categorized under 'Mat' based on the metadata listed, particularly 'Category: On The Mat' and the emphasis on a 'Lower body focus off Hydrow'. The circuit format and use of 'EMOM' (Every Minute on the Minute) also align with mat-based exercises where participants perform movements at regular intervals. The score of 0.7 reflects strong confidence in this categorization. \n\n'Indoor rowing' is also applicable, given the mention of '60-second intervals on Hydrow', which is a specific type of rowing machine. This indicates that part of the workout is conducted on a rowing machine, although it seems to be a supplementary activity to the lower body mat exercises, thus a score of 0.6. \n\nThe workout name 'Lower Body Circuit', duration of around 21 minutes, explicit music with a high-energy playlist, and a format indicating interval training suggest an energetic, structured workout which doesn't fit well under categories strictly related to relaxation or flexibility such as Stretching, Yoga or Pilates."
