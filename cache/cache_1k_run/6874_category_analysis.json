  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout title 'Core Strength' and the tag 'On The Mat' from the category section strongly indicate that this is a mat-based workout focusing on core exercises, leading to a high confidence in selecting the 'Mat' category with a score of 0.9. The setting on a helicopter pad suggests a stationary workout format, typical for mat exercises. The description lacks any mention of equipment, suggesting likely reliance on body weight exercises to achieve core strength, supporting the selection of 'Body weight' with a score of 0.6. The music selection, including upbeat tracks from genres like Hip Hop and R&B, could imply a motivational backdrop for sustained mat exercises, further reinforcing these categories. The absence of explicit indicators or mention of any additional equipment rules out categories like Weight workout. Categories like Yoga, Pilates, or Stretching were excluded due to the focus on core strength rather than flexibility or relaxation."
