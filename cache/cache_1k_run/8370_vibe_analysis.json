  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Strength,' described as 'Ignite your core with Pete while listening to 80s music,' suggests a playful, rhythmic vibe suitable for 'The Groove Session.' The mention of 80s music like UB40 and When In Rome indicates a fun and expressive atmosphere, which aligns with the 'Groove Session.' This earns a score of 0.7. The short duration of 5 minutes and 35 seconds alongside a mat-based workout suggests a restorative vibe as well, fitting 'The Reboot Workout' with a score of 0.6 as it's low stress and refreshing. Additionally, focusing on core strength while maintaining repetition ties in with 'The Meditative Grind,' which centers around zone-focused repetition, earning a score of 0.5. The absence of specified intense or dynamic elements in the description excludes more vigorous vibes."
