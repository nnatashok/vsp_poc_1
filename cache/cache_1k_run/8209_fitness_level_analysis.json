  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "At approximately 21 minutes, this pilates circuit workout is relatively short, suggesting moderate physical demand. The lack of equipment and the upbeat music genre suggest an engaging but not overly intense session. Circuits can induce a moderate level of effort, especially with repeated cycles, potentially making it somewhat challenging for less conditioned users. While it's moderately effortful for a beginner, those with an Intermediate level might find it less demanding, thus aligning more with Moderate difficulty overall.",
