  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row' and 'sweat,' which generally implies simpler, repetitive movements suitable for reinforcing rowing form. Given the intermediate rhythm pace of 26 and the emphasis on core focus, there is some alignment with intermediate level due to coordination requirements. However, as it is a rowing workout, movements are mechanically straightforward, making it beginner-friendly. Therefore, technique aligns most strongly with Beginner and Intermediate levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 11:27 minutes and rhythm of 26 indicate a moderate level of physical demand, particularly since the workout type is 'sweat' with efforts set by time. The instructor's description and intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggest a moderately challenging effort level, suitable for less fit users but requiring some exertion, particularly in maintaining pace across 2-3 minute intervals. The emphasis on core focus during rowing also adds a challenging component, warranting a combination of Moderate and Challenging scores.",
