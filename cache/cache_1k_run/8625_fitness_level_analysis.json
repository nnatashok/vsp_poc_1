Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 5 minutes and 35 seconds, which is very short and typically indicative of light effort. The focus on mobility with a foam roller suggests low-intensity, restorative movements aimed at stretching and flexibility. Therefore, the effort difficulty is chiefly Light. Given the nature of foam rolling, there might be a slight increase in effort for very deconditioned users, which slightly inclines towards Moderate.",
