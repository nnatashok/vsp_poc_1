  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Pyramid Intervals Row' suggests a structured intensity, matching 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe seen in endurance rowing with an elevated energy. This vibe receives a score of 0.8, as the session is designed to build intensity and rhythm in a controlled manner over a 21-minute duration, leading to a steady release of endorphins. The pyramid format and focus on rhythm contribute to this classification.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Meditative Grind' is relevant with a score of 0.7. The repetitive nature of the rowing workout and the format of climbing and descending intervals help participants zoned in, locked in a meditative state driven by rhythm and structure.\n\nThe music playlist containing dance and global hits with songs like 'You & Me (Flume Remix)' and 'Heat Waves (Riton Remix)' aligns with 'The Nightclub Workout', earning it a score of 0.5. The energetic, beat-driven music supports a nightclub-like vibe though less prominent due to the focus on intensity and endurance rather than a euphoria-driven full-body experience. Overall, confidence is high due to clear explicit indicators like workout type, intensity, and music style."
