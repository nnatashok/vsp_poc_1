  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled 'Steady Cool-Down' is explicitly a cool-down workout focused on rowing. The description mentions rowing 'steadily,' which aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, characterized by repetition and endurance, scoring a 0.75 due to its clear fit. The use of locations like the 'Charles River' evokes a natural, outdoor setting, fitting 'The Nature Flow' vibe, which scores a 0.6 due to the potential outdoor scenario suggested by the description and image. The workout's duration, along with 80's global hits music, supports a relaxed cool-down atmosphere. 'Higher Love' by Steve Winwood provides an uplifting feel, complementing a meditative and natural experience. Despite the upbeat music, the workout remains relaxed in pace, aligning more with the repetitive nature of 'The Meditative Grind' and the scenic aspect of 'The Nature Flow,' leaving out higher intensity vibes."
