  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is short at just over 10 minutes, primarily classifying it under Light effort difficulty as it is designed for pre-workout mobility, emphasizing gentle movements. The 'mobility' workout type suggests exercises that are not energy-intensive, supporting significant alignment with Light effort. The mention of music genres indicates a stable pace but not high-intensity, with some alignment to Moderate if movements require holding positions or extended stretches.",
