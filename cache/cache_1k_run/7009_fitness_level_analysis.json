  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type being 'Drive', as classified by Hydrow-specific rules, inherently denotes a higher skill requirement but can only reach up to Intermediate for a rowing category. The use of terms like 'in-depth technical detail' and 'climb in rhythm' suggests a need for control and coordination, characteristic of at least an Intermediate Technique Difficulty classification.",
