  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 5 minutes and 43 seconds, categorized specifically as a 'cool down'. It's designed to gradually slow down and lower heart rate. The low pace and short duration ensure minimal physical demand, aligning perfectly with 'Light' effort difficulty. The absence of intense bursts, coupled with relaxing musical accompaniment, further confirms this level.",
