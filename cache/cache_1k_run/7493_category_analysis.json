  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as an 'endurance row' with a format focused on power, clearly indicating that the workout involves indoor rowing. The title 'Unleashed Row' and the category tags like 'row' further support this classification. The absence of any other equipment or exercise types mentioned rules out other categories such as 'Strength Training' or 'Mat Exercises'. The high-intensity level (3 out of 3) combined with a focus on rhythm suggests a vigorous rowing session, which aligns strongly with 'Indoor Rowing' as a category. The use of energetic music genres like dance and global hits complements the high-energy nature of the workout. This strong, consistent evidence from multiple metadata points supports a high confidence classification as 'Indoor rowing' with a full score of 1.0."
