Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is relatively short at under 6 minutes, typical for a standard warm-up, which implies that the energy expenditure is likely low. Such activities are generally designed to gently elevate heart rate without causing fatigue. The max rhythm of 30 and 'Climb' format suggests a moderate tempo, potentially requiring some effort, but still aligns closely with light physical demand. Thus, the effort difficulty scores strongly as Light, with a small degree of Moderate, given the nature of increment within the 'Climb' approach.",
