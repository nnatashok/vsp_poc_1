Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "As a warm-up with a short duration of 5 minutes and 53 seconds, the effort difficulty is primarily Light (0.9). The focus on power and quickness suggests a slightly higher intensity, but still within a range that is accessible to most users. Some elements might challenge slightly, hence a low Moderate score (0.3) due to the possibility of a higher rhythm reaching 30 indicating some intensity. Overall, the workout remains Light in demands.",
