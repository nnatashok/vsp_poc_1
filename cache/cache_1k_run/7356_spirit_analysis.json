  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"Outdoor & Adventure\" due to the rowing taking place on a river, which is supported by the image showing the setting. This environment is a key indicator. The spirit \"High-Energy & Intense\" is also strongly represented as evidenced by the use of HIIT format (\"2' intervals,\" \"Max rhythm: 32\"), and an intensity level of 3 out of 3, suggesting a vigorous session designed to push participants physically. The playlist, featuring energetic songs like \"Gotta Get Thru This\" and \"All Around The World,\" further supports this high-energy classification. The absence of an instructor doesn't diminish these spirits, as the metadata provides clear signals of both adventure and intensity."
