  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the short duration of 5 minutes and the description as a 'cool-down', the workout has a very low physical demand, aligning it strongly with a Light effort difficulty. The max rhythm is relatively low at 20, typical of cooldown sessions, confirming it as minimally demanding physically. It has a weak alignment with Moderate level due to its potential demand on users unfamiliar with maintaining correct wrist position over time.",
