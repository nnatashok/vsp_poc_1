  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'The Masterclass Workout' due to its instructional format, which emphasizes learning specific techniques to enhance rowing stroke efficiency. The focus on skill-building fits well with this vibe, garnering a score of 0.7. Additionally, the 'The Meditative Grind' vibe is relevant as the workout is a rowing session with a disciplined rhythm (max rhythm: 24) and could foster a zone-in experience, scoring 0.6. The inclusion of the high-intensity rock music slightly supports this vibe being lower-paced overall.\n\nLastly, there is a mild association with 'The Progression Quest' vibe because the instructional nature and focus on improving technique suggest an element of progression over time, but the short duration limits this correlation, leading to a score of 0.4."
