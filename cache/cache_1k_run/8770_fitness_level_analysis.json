  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a cool down with only 5 minutes and 50 seconds duration, specifically designed to reinforce technique without exertion. With a max rhythm of 22, it's intended to be a low-intensity session suitable for recovery, thus aligning perfectly with a Light effort level. The focus is on technique rather than energy expenditure, making a Light score very strongly aligned.",
