  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and 'standard' with the specific mention of a 'Reverse Climb' format, indicating the use of rowing equipment. Additionally, the presence of 'Reverse Climb Cool-Down' in the title strongly suggests involvement of rowing. The accompanying image supports rowing activity as it shows individuals rowing on water, further reinforcing the need for a rowing machine for an indoor equivalent. The confidence score of 0.9 reflects this explicit emphasis on rowing, as typical cool-down activities don't always use equipment, but the type category necessitates a rowing machine."
