  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is a short 5 minutes and 39 seconds, typical for a cool-down session, indicating light physical demand. Cool-downs are generally low intensity, focusing more on reducing heart rate and stretching than on vigorous activity. The metadata supports a primary classification of 'Light' effort difficulty with a high score of 0.95, as it would not exert significant energy demands on the user.",
