  "categoriesExplanation": "The metadata provided strongly suggests an 'Indoor rowing' and slight 'Stretching' classification for the workout. The title \"Drop Your Split: Recovery Cool-Down\" along with terms like \"recovery\" and \"cool down\" imply a session focused on post-rowing recovery, which traditionally involves rowing at a lower pace. The description mentions a focus on 'breathing and recovery', which aligns with a light rowing activity rather than more static stretching moves, hence the higher score for 'Indoor rowing' (0.7). However, the use of phrases such as 'Equipments: {}' and 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo music genre' could also suggest elements of a calm cool-down period typically involving static or dynamic stretching, giving 'Stretching' a moderate presence (0.3). The absence of equipment and the mention of a maximum rhythm aligns with managing row intensity, indicating a row-centric cool-down. Overall confidence is moderately high given these indicators."
