  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is just over 20 minutes and consists of continuous rounds of exercises, implying sustained effort. The 'strength' workout type with 'four rounds' and no rest indicated suggests a moderate energy expenditure, fitting a Moderate effort difficulty. However, the involvement of a two-time Olympian instructor implies a higher challenge level due to potentially high-intensity cueing and motivation, supporting a Challenging classification as well. Hence, Moderate (score 0.7) and Challenging (score 0.5) levels are suitable.",
