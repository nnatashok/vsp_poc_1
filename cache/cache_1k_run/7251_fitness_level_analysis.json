  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 20 minutes and 50 seconds long, consisting of four rounds of bodyweight exercises, which suggests a moderate level of energy expenditure. Without external weights or intense interval training, the workout could fall into a lighter intensity range. However, as there are multiple rounds, the energy output bumps effort closer to a moderate range, appealing to beginners and intermediate exercisers who need a bit more engagement without overstraining.",
