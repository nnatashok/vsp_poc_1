  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and described as 'technique oriented' with a focus on legs and core. While rowing generally involves straightforward movements, the mention of improved technique suggests elements intermediate users might find beneficial. However, the fundamental movements are basic, which aligns with a 'Beginner' to 'Intermediate' range. Thus, technique difficulty scores are 0.8 for Beginner and 0.6 for Intermediate, with high confidence due to the emphasis on rowing technique and standard rowing practices.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 11:19 minutes, and with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, this indicates a reasonable effort is required without being overly challenging for less fit users. The interval format could increase the intensity slightly, but the manageable duration suggests a moderate energy requirement. This aligns more with 'Moderate' effort difficulty at a score of 0.7, with clear cues pointing towards a moderate level of exertion required during the session.",
