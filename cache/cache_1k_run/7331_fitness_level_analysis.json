  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With an intensity level of 2 out of 3, and a focus on 'sweat' with intervals, this workout is designed to moderately challenge the cardiovascular system. An 11-minute duration suggests a quick, but moderately intense effort suitable for users needing a stronger than light challenge, but not extreme. The rowing focus aligns with moderate energy expenditure, with potential brief high effort bursts due to interval format. Thus, it falls primarily into the Moderate effort difficulty classification, with a slight lean towards Challenging.",
