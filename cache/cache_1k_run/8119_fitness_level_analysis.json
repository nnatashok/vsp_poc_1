The metadata specifies a 'steady' pace with a low maximum rhythm of 20 strokes per minute, emphasizing low exertion. This aligns most closely with a 'Light' effort difficulty due to minimal energy expenditure (Score: 0.9). There is minimal alignment with a 'Moderate' level due to the structured rowing pace (0.2).",
