  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is clearly classified as 'Yoga' due to several strong indicators in the metadata. The phrases \"heart opening flow\" and \"leads you through this flow\" explicitly suggest a yoga practice, as 'flow' is commonly associated with yoga sequences like Vinyasa or flow yoga sessions. Additionally, the inclusion of yoga blocks as recommended equipment further supports this classification since yoga often utilizes props like blocks. Furthermore, the relaxing and scenic description aligns with the meditative and mindful aspects of yoga, contributing to a holistic experience beyond just physical activity. The music playlist, featuring chill and downtempo music genres, also complements the calm and fluid nature typically associated with yoga sessions. This, combined with the duration being typical for a yoga session, solidifies the placement of this workout into the Yoga category with high confidence."
