  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as a 'cool down' with a duration of just under 6 minutes and a maximum rhythm of 20.

The short duration further supports a low effort requirement. Overall, this workout aligns with a Light level of effort difficulty, appropriate for recovery and relaxation rather than intense exercise.",
