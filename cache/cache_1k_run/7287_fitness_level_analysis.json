Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of approximately 20 minutes focused on mobility and corrective exercises aimed at releasing tension, this workout is characterized by low energy expenditure and the absence of intense cardiovascular or high-intensity activities. This strongly aligns with a Light effort difficulty. However, the inclusion of maintaining and releasing holds could imply a mild increase in effort for less fit individuals, slightly touching the lower bounds of Moderate. Overall, the low impact and absence of intense physical exertion strongly support a Light classification.",
