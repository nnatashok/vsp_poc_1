  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Gratitude Row' involves rhythmic rowing intervals with a focus on gratitude, described under 'breathe' and 'standard' categories, suggesting a blend of mindfulness and repetition. This aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' due to the emphasis on rhythm and reflection. The max rhythm of 26 suggests a steady but not taxing pace.\n\nThe use of calming, acoustic music like 'Sunday Morning (Acoustic)' and reflective themes add elements indicative of 'The Zen Flow', which is breath-centered and grounding, justifying a score of 0.65. \n\n'The Endorphin Wave' is also somewhat applicable, given the duration and steady rhythm, though it's a moderate match due to the workout's low intensity (1 out of 3) and the calming music playlist, scoring 0.45. The workout's focus on gratitude and breathwork steers it away from high-intensity vibes like 'The Warrior Workout', confirming a calm, reflective classification."
