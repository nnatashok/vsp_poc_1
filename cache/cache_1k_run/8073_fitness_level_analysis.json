  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is short, with a duration of just over 10 minutes, typical for a warm-up. It focuses on increasing rhythm and power, which might elevate effort slightly, yet not intensely. Given it's a warm-up with a max rhythm set at 34, which is moderately high for rowing, it can slightly challenge a beginner. Thus, it clearly aligns with Light effort, accommodating those just starting, but with some features hinting at Moderate due to the rhythm component.",
