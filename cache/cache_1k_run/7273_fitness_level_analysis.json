  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which per Hydrow-specific rules, constrains Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The description mentions alternating between low and high rhythms, suggesting moderate coordination. However, the workout aligns more closely with beginner levels due to the 'breathe' category, minimal coordination, and user fitness level requirement of 'Beginner', limiting it to a maximum logical beginners' technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 46 minutes suggests a significant time commitment, which contributes to increased physical effort. However, the workout intensity level is 1 out of 3, indicating a lower intensity workout, thus aligning more strongly with a Moderate effort level. The inclusion of interval training with varying rhythms adds a slight upgrade to potentially Challenging, but the overall energy expenditure remains in the Moderate range given the workout category and intensity rating.",
