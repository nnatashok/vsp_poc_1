  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically aligns with the Beginner to Intermediate range for technique difficulty. The 'sweat' and 'standard' classifications do not suggest complex technique beyond basic rowing, and no specific form complexity or technical drills are mentioned in the description. Hence, the primary technique difficulty rests at the Beginner level, with a modest consideration for Intermediate due to interval nature.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout spans approximately 12 minutes with 4-minute intervals, suggesting it is designed to be more intense than a standard session, indicated by the 'sweat' type and a 2 out of 3 intensity rating. The 'climb' format and max rhythm of 30 further suggest boosts in effort. As such, the effort difficulty aligns with Moderate to Challenging. While intense at moments, the brief duration prevents a higher effort classification.",
