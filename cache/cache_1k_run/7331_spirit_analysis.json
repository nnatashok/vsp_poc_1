  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'Structured & Disciplined' due to the focus on technique and intervals, as indicated by the description mentioning 'technique oriented interval workout.' This structured approach is characteristic of this spirit, and it reflects a methodical progression focused on technical precision, leading to a score of 0.75.\n\nAdditionally, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is strongly applicable due to the visual content showing a rowing session on a river. This natural setting supports an 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification, earning a high confidence score of 0.8. \n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' are less applicable due to the intermediate intensity level described (2 out of 3) and the focus on technique rather than sheer effort. The music, featuring Country and Global Hits, aligns somewhat with both structured and outdoor settings but lacks the focus to constitute a 'Flow & Rhythm' classification. \n\nOverall, the combination of methodical training and outdoor rowing environment strongly supports these classifications."
