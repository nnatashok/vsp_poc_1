  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing session classified under 'row' type, which limits the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate, according to platform-specific rules. The description highlights intervals at rhythm 26, which suggests some complexity. However, with the description focusing on team energy and positivity, it is likely geared towards users with basic rowing experience, making Beginner the stronger fit with Intermediate as a secondary option due to rhythm precision.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session consists of three 3-minute intervals at a rhythm of 26 in a 16-minute workout, indicating a moderate-to-high intensity, as evidenced by the intermediate workout intensity level provided. The intervals provide some rest, reducing overall demand but maintaining significant effort through rhythm. For physically deconditioned users, this can be quite challenging, especially due to the sustained moderate rhythm.",
