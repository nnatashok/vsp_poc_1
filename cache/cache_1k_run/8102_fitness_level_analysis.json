  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video is classified as both a 'cool down' and 'technique' session, with a short duration of under 6 minutes, suggesting minimal physical exertion. The focus on proper form and technique, combined with the low rhythm and the instructional nature, supports a primary alignment with 'Light' effort. There is no indication of high-intensity activities, solidly placing the workout in the 'Light' category with high confidence.",
