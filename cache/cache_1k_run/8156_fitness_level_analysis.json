  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout falls under the 'row' category with a specific emphasis on the 'drive' type, according to Hydrow's classification, which constrains the technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. However, the presence of the 'Drive' workout type, known for requiring strong, effective pulling of the handle to power the rower, entails more attention to technique than basic rowing. Given these factors, the technique difficulty is rated Intermediate with high confidence as it necessitates some coordination and understanding of rowing form.",

The workout involves a 'challenge for maximum meters,' which suggests a high energy output expected in a short span, characteristic of challenging workout types. Hence, the effort difficulty is classified as Challenging with high confidence, as it demands significant effort for completion.",
