  "categoriesConfidence": 0.9,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category 'Stretching' was chosen due to the explicit mention in both the workout name 'Whole Body Stretch' and the description indicating a focus on stretching various body parts like hips, hamstrings, back, and glutes. It is further confirmed by 'Workout Type: stretching' and the video being categorized under 'On the Mat', which aligns with stretching exercises. The description's emphasis on stretching specific muscles strongly contributes to a high confidence level of 0.9 for this category. \n\nThe 'Yoga' category was also considered with a lower score of 0.3 due to potential overlap, as yoga often includes stretching components. The peaceful setting in Norway and the potential of integrated mindful movement might hint at yoga-like aspects. However, the lack of explicit mention of yoga postures or practices keeps the score low. Other categories like 'Mat' or 'Pilates' were less fitting given the strong emphasis on stretching exercises without evidence for bodyweight exercises or core-focused Pilates."
