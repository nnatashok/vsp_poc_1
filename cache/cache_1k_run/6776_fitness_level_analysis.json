  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily rowing-based, as indicated by the 'row' category and the use of the term 'steadily row'. Rowing, in general, is classified under 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate' for technique difficulty due to the straightforward nature of the motion when performed at a basic level. The emphasis on 'tuning into the technique of each stroke' suggests a slight increase in complexity, meriting a slight Intermediate score, but overall, the movement remains relatively simple, aligning strongly with a Beginner classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 16 minutes with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, suggesting a light to moderate energy demand. The 'Steady' format likely indicates a consistent, manageable pace that aligns with a light effort level suitable for beginners. The rowing rhythm maxing at 24 signals a steady but not overwhelmingly intense pace. Consequently, this workout is primarily Light but with some moderate elements due to the maintained rhythm and duration.",
