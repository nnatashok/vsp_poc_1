  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified as 'Indoor rowing' due to several strong indicators in the metadata. The workout name 'Climbing Intervals Row' explicitly references rowing, suggesting that it is an indoor rowing-focused workout. The description mentions focusing on technique during intervals and shifts in rhythm, which aligns with rowing workouts where rhythm or stroke rate can be varied. Additionally, the category tag 'row' strongly supports this classification. The workout is labeled with a moderate intensity of 2 out of 3, a level that is consistent with structured rowing sessions that involve interval training. The absence of any other equipment-specific tags and the emphasis on technique and rhythm further confirm that this is an indoor rowing workout. Minor consideration was given to other categories, but no evidence supports them over rowing. The confidence level is high due to explicit references and tags related to rowing."
