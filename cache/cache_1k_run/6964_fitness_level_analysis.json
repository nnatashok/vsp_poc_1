  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout 'Finding Balance Row' falls under the rowing category, which according to rules generally aligns with a Beginner or Intermediate Technique Difficulty level. The session involves two steady 6-minute pieces with a maximum rhythm of 22, suggesting very basic rowing techniques. The emphasis on steady rhythm and instructional guidance from a professional like Dani, who offers technical detail, supports a Beginner classification. Some small shift toward Intermediate is noted due to the instructional quality and balance concept, but overall remains Beginner-focused due to simplicity.",
