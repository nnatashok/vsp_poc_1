  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing session, categorized under 'sweat,' indicating a focus on cardiovascular endurance. The technique complexity is primarily around maintaining proper rowing form and adjusting to rhythm changes. Given the platform\u2019s emphasis on rowing, it's likely Drills like rhythm changes, which can introduce minor complexity. Therefore, the Technique Difficulty aligns most strongly with Beginner (score 0.8), but has partial alignment with Intermediate (score 0.6) because of the rhythm shifts, common in rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The interval format with rhythm increases from 24 to 28 and the Sweat category suggest a medium level of intensity. The duration of 16 minutes and description involving continuous rhythm change implies moderate exertion but not extreme intensity. Consequently, the effort difficulty has strong alignment with Moderate (score 0.75) and partial alignment with Challenging (score 0.4) due to the rhythm intensity.",
