  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a rowing workout, which typically involves movements that are either Beginner or Intermediate in technique difficulty. The interval format with rhythm changes suggests a requirement for some coordination, especially since the rhythm climbs from 24 to 28. This, combined with an intermediate user fitness level requirement, supports a classification leaning towards Intermediate, but with a clear allowance for Beginners as well, given the nature of rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is a moderate 16 minutes and 19 seconds, with an intensity level of 2 out of 3. This suggests higher energy expenditure and effort, especially given the rhythmic changes and the interval nature of the session. The presence of sweat-focused exercises further indicates a challenging level for individuals at a lower fitness level, while still being manageable for users in slightly better shape. Thus, the effort difficulty fits well within the Challenging category for those starting, while providing a moderately demanding experience for more conditioned users.",
