  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is approximately 20 minutes and is described as a 'whole body Pilates' session. Pilates, even at an intermediate level, tends to focus more on control and strength rather than cardiovascular intensity, especially in a 20-minute session. Despite the energetic music cues, the physical demand likely remains moderate, implying it provides a standard workout challenge without intense or high-impact exercises. Relatively short duration and no mention of high-intensity elements suggest a stronger alignment with 'Moderate' (0.7) effort difficulty, with some elements that could be considered 'Light' (0.3).",
