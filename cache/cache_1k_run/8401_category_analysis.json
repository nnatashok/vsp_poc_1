  "categoriesExplanation": "The video titled 'Sandwich Row' clearly suggests the involvement of rowing, further supported by the description indicating a workout focused on power and speed with transitions between rhythms. This aligns with indoor rowing, especially considering the 'max rhythm: 30' and 'interval format,' matching characteristics typical of rowing workouts. \"Sweat\" and \"Standard\" categories, along with the workout type labeled as 'sweat,' suggest a moderate to high intensity which is appropriate for indoor rowing. The workout intensity level is 2 out of 3, indicating a challenging physical effort, commonly associated with indoor rowing and potentially HIIT due to the 'interval' structure mentioned, which involves alternating periods of activity and rest. The lack of specific mention of rowing machines supports the inference based on rhythm and interval aspects, while absence of equipment suggests that it's likely focused solely on standard rowing machines without additional apparatus. Thus, indoor rowing is the primary category with a score of 0.9, and HIIT is secondary with a score of 0.6 due to the interval nature."
