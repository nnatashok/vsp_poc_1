  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Soothing & Restorative' due to its focus on cooling down and gradually reducing rhythm, as indicated by the name 'Reverse Climb Cool-Down' and description mentioning a focus on technique. This aligns with the energy of recovery and relaxation typical of a cool-down session. The scoring is high (0.8) due to these explicit indications of a gentler, restorative nature. \n\nAdditionally, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is assigned with a score of 0.7. The video depiction shows rowing on a river, which fits the outdoor environment classification. This is supported by the image and typical rowing situation depicted, suggesting an interaction with nature. \n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', and 'Flow & Rhythm' are excluded as the metadata lacks elements of intensity or structured movement patterns. Sport & Agility is also ruled out due to the focus being on cooling down rather than enhancing performance skills."
