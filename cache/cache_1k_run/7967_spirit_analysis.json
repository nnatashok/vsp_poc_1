  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout combines several spirits, primarily 'Flow & Rhythm,' 'Structured & Disciplined,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure.' The use of rhythmic and effort-based intervals, as mentioned in 'raise your rhythm,' aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, making this an essential component. The intervals also suggest a 'Structured & Disciplined' approach, with a clear format and structure indicated by '90-second intervals.' The high-confidence indicator for 'Outdoor & Adventure' comes from the visual evidence, showing the workout taking place in a scenic outdoor setting, directly fulfilling the criteria for this spirit. The combination of upbeat music from the 'Pop mid, Global Hits' radio stations further supports the rhythmic and flow-based qualities of the workout. This mixed approach yields a well-rounded analysis of the workout's spirits."
