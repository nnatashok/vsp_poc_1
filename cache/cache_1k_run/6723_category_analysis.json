  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is clearly an Indoor Rowing session as indicated by the title 'Power Pyramid Row' and the category tags 'standard,row'. The term 'power pyramid' and the description focusing on '45\", 30\", and 15\" intervals' strongly suggest the use of a rowing machine, which is the hallmark of an Indoor Rowing workout. Additionally, the mention of 'drive', a common term in rowing, supports this categorization. The high-intensity nature is emphasized by the explicit mention of intervals and an intensity level of '3 out of 3', along with the categorization as 'HIIT' in the description, which typically involves periods of intense effort followed by rest, further justifying the HIIT classification. Therefore, the categories 'Indoor Rowing' with a score of 0.95 due to its central presence, and 'HIIT' with a score of 0.85 due to its strong influence are assigned."
