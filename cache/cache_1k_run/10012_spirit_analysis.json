  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Structured & Disciplined' due to its format described as a 'circuit' with 'upper body dumbbell exercises' and '3-minute intervals.' This indicates a regimented approach combining strength training with interval cardio, reflecting a structured pattern. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is assigned a score of 0.75, reflecting the clear presence of methodical elements.\n\nAdditionally, this workout embodies elements of 'High-Energy & Intense,' suggested by the use of intervals and a max rhythm of 26. The combination of dumbbell exercises and rowing likely involves vigorous activity, contributing to its intensity. This spirit is assigned a score of 0.6, as the intensity is implied rather than explicitly stated but can be reasonably inferred from the workout type and equipment used.\n\nThe setting indoors and lack of outdoor elements exclude the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, while the lack of sports-specificity and a focus on recovery rules out 'Sport & Agility' and 'Soothing & Restorative.'"
