  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is 10 minutes and 39 seconds, focusing on mobility, which typically involves slow and controlled movements aiming for flexibility, not high energy expenditure. The lack of intense cardio or significant resistance work categorizes it under 'Light' effort difficulty. With moderate confidence, it aligns with exercises that are more restorative than effort-intensive.",
