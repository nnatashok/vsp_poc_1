Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 10-minute duration and the focus on mobility exercises indicate low energy expenditure and intensity, aligning with a light effort difficulty. The potential for some involvement of muscle activation through self-myofascial release could slightly lean towards moderate effort, yet the duration and workout focus strongly suggest a primarily light classification.",
