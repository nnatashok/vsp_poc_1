  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'Energizing Cool-Down', indicating a low effort, relaxed pace. With a duration of just under 6 minutes and the fact that it's a cool-down workout, this strongly aligns with a 'Light' effort difficulty, as evidenced by the emphasis on 'stay loose' and 'keep things light and energetic', which are typical of gentle movements aimed at winding down from more intense activity.",
