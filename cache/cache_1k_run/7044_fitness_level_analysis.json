The additional complexity introduced by staying at certain rhythms slightly validates an Intermediate level, but given that the User Fitness Level is set to Beginner, the strong alignment is towards Beginner level technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is 21 minutes with an intensity level marked as 1 out of 3 (suggesting minimal exertion). This aligns with a light effort difficulty. The rhythm focuses on maintaining a pace rather than pushing high intensity or varying tempos, which could imply a moderate effort for a beginner or less fit user. However, given the session's length and intensity level, 'Light' is the more accurate classification.",
