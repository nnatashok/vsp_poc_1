  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout type is noted as 'pilates' in the metadata, and the category 'On The Mat' strongly suggests the need for a mat. Additionally, the workout is set outdoors in the image, with the participant using a mat. These elements provide very high confidence (0.9) that a mat is central to this Pilates workout.
