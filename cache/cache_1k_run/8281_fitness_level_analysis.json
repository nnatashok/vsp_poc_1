  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is classified as 'Drive', which on the Hydrow platform denotes an advanced level of rowing technique. However, according to rules for rowing workouts, the technique difficulty typically ranges from Beginner to Intermediate due to the movement's inherent simplicity compared to more complex exercises. The high rhythm (up to 32) suggests a need for good coordination and technique, elevating it from Beginner to Intermediate with a strong confidence score due to the Drive classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is particularly intense, described as 'maximum pace' and reaching an intensity level 3 out of 3. The use of 'drive' in the format indicates a focus on power, further implying a significant physical demand. The inclusion of high rhythm rates (28-32) compounds this by increasing the cardiovascular challenge. The duration of 21 minutes and 32 seconds, combined with this intensity, strongly aligns with an 'Extreme' effort difficulty, but is not the most taxing possible, thus also scoring well in 'Challenging'.",
