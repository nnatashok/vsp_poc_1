  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'drive' and 'row', suggesting a level of sophistication in rowing technique with a blend of power elements, placing it at Intermediate. The focus on rhythms 28 through 32 and the expert guidance from Dani, a Paralympian medalist known for expert technical instruction, further supports this classification. However, since it's rowing-based, it cannot be higher than Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 21:32 minutes, combined with a maximum pace and high-intensity number of 3 out of 3, indicates high energy expenditure at intense paces. This suggests patterns that are Challenging for most, but might edge into Extreme for deconditioned users due to sustained high-pacing and minimal rest messaging implied in the metadata.",
