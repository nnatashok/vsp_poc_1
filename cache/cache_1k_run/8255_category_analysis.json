  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'Indoor rowing' with a high confidence score because the title 'Open Rhythm Row' and the description clearly indicate that it's a rowing workout focusing on intervals. The usage of rowing-specific terms like 'open rhythm' and emphasis on rowing intervals explicitly demonstrate that this is a rowing session. 'HIIT' is also relevant with a notable score due to the workout being interval-based, which is a defining characteristic of HIIT training. The workout's 'max rhythm: 30+' and 'workout intensity level: 3 out of 3' suggest high-intensity exercise. The playlist includes energetic and motivating tracks, supporting the intense and rhythm-driven nature of the workout."
