  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'cool-down', lasting just under 6 minutes, with music from chill genres. Cool-down exercises inherently involve low-intensity activities aimed at reducing heart rate and promoting relaxation, which corresponds to a 'Light' effort level. The short duration and structure as a cool-down are indicators that it is not physically demanding, consolidating its classification as Light.",
