  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Rock HIIT Row' is best classified under 'The Warrior Workout' and 'The Adrenaline Rush'. The use of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with intervals of 2 minutes and 1 minute indicates a demanding and intense workout, typical of 'The Warrior Workout', which scores 0.9 due to the primal, heart-pounding nature implied by the intensity level of 3 out of 3. The accompanying music, featuring high-energy Pop Punk and Global Hits, supports this vibe by adding an adrenaline-pumping soundtrack encouraging a high level of engagement and energy.\n\n'Adrenaline Rush' scores 0.7 as the intervals and music genre, including songs by Fall Out Boy and Yellowcard, contribute to a heart-racing experience with unpredictable challenges during the intervals. However, the absence of specific danger elements or unpredictability beyond the interval structure caps the score at 0.7. Other vibes like 'The Nightclub Workout' or 'The Groove Session' were excluded due to the workout's focus on intensity rather than rhythm-based flow or dance elements."
