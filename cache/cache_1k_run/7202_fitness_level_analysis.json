  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's classification under 'drive' implies that it pertains to skill-intensive activities. The specific mention of 'sets of 10-stroke builders' suggests a focus on nuanced rowing techniques requiring advanced coordination and control. The inclusion of 'max pace' indicates an expectation of precise execution under high-intensity conditions, aligning well with advanced techniques. The user requirement level of 'advanced' further supports this classification, adhering to the interdependence rule between fitness level and technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of over 11 minutes with an intensity level rated as 3 out of 3 suggests a high energy expenditure. The format being 'interval', specifically with 'max pace' works, implies repeated exertion levels potentially pushing effort towards 'Extreme'. However, given the 11-minute duration and non-continuous exertion, it suits 'Challenging' for deconditioned users. The drive type increases intensity, confirming the high effort required, thus justifying alignment with 'Challenging' to 'Extreme'.",
