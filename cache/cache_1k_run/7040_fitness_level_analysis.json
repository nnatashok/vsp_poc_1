  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout 'Power HIIT Row' is classified under the 'Drive' category, which includes technically demanding rowing exercises. However, since it is a rowing workout, Technique Difficulty can only reach as high as Intermediate. The high-intensity intervals and sprints suggest a technique complexity just at the border of Intermediate and Advanced. I'm assigning Intermediate with a score of 0.9 and Advanced at 0.6 based on these considerations.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 21:40 minutes with high-intensity intervals and a max rhythm of 32 suggests a very demanding workout. The '3 out of 3' intensity level and final 15-second sprints are indicators of high energy expenditure, frequent bursts of effort, and minimal rest. This aligns more strongly with Extreme difficulty, deserving a score of 0.9, but Challenging is also applicable with a score of 0.7 given the intense nature may not reach maximal exertion for all users.",
