  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Power Strokes Warm-Up' with a description involving '10-power strokes' and a format listed as 'Intervals' is indicative of an 'Indoor rowing' session. Despite the absence of 'rowing' in the title, 'power strokes' are a specific term widely associated with rowing exercises, suggesting an emphasis on strength and high effort per stroke which aligns with indoor rowing workouts. Additionally, the categorization in the metadata includes 'row', further reinforcing this classification. The short duration of 5 minutes and 45 seconds fits a rowing warm-up, aiming to elevate heart rate. The music genre and songs listed (e.g., 'Good Time', 'Blame') are typically used in energetic workout environments, supporting the idea of a fast-paced cardiovascular exercise. Therefore, 'Indoor rowing' is scored at 1.0 for its extremely strong presence and central defining characteristic of this workout."
