  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Build Confidence Row\" exhibits several distinct spirits. The most dominant is **Structured & Disciplined** (score: 0.9), as indicated by the \"four sets of 4-minute climbing intervals\" which suggests a methodical and planned routine. The term \"create a plan for yourself\" further reinforces the structured nature. \n\n**High-Energy & Intense** (score: 0.7) is also prominent due to the \"sweat\" category, a high max rhythm of 30, and the playlist featuring upbeat pop hits like \"Levitating\" by Dua Lipa and \"That's My Girl\" by Fifth Harmony, implying a motivational vibe. \n\n**Outdoor & Adventure** (score: 0.8) is inferred from the rowing taking place on a river, aligning with a connection to nature and outdoor settings. \n\nThe minor spirit of **Flow & Rhythm** could be considered but isn\u2019t as strong due to the structured interval format rather than continuous rhythmic movement. Also, the session seems less focused on recovery, giving less weight to **Soothing & Restorative**. Overall, the confidence level is high due to clear indicators in the metadata."
