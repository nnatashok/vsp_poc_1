  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Drive' type row, which Hydrow classifies as Intermediate for technique difficulty. The focus on improving stroke technique with varying rhythms and a high max rhythm of 32 suggests a certain level of coordination is required. However, since it's a rowing workout, the complexity is kept at an Intermediate level as per the established platform rules.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of 16 minutes, which is relatively short; however, the intensity level is marked as 3 out of 3, indicating it is highly demanding. The description of focusing on technique with 'varying rhythms' suggests a high degree of exertion. The playlist of high-energy, classic rock songs supports this as they often accompany more vigorous activities. Thus, the effort difficulty leans towards Challenging, with a substantial leaning towards Extreme due to maximum exertion prompts.",
