  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a 'Drive' classification, which, combined with an intensity level of 3 out of 3, suggests it is highly demanding. The interval format with varying rhythms further increases the intensity, demanding significant energy expenditure. Therefore, it aligns strongly with a 'Challenging' rating, and to some extent, an 'Extreme' rating, due to the competitive nature implied by the Olympian trainer and the intense pace setting.",
