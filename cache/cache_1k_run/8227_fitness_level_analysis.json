  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' with a 'breathe' workout type, meaning it primarily focuses on rhythm and sustained effort rather than complex movements. These factors suggest a basic to moderately coordinated effort, aligning with a Beginner technique level. The rhythm cap of 24, indicative of a moderate pace, may require slightly more than minimal coordination, which justifies a partial inclusion of Intermediate classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 16 minutes, with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, described as focusing on building endurance and maintaining a rhythm. These elements imply a Light to Moderate effort level, suitable for deconditioned users. There is evidence to support light aerobic energy expenditure, while the pyramid format suggests gradual intensity increases, hence the moderate score.",
