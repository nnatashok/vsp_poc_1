  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is classified as 'drive', and the category includes 'row', which typically sets the Technique Difficulty between Beginner and Intermediate according to the specific Hydrow rules. 'Drive' workouts are considered advanced because they often involve challenging rowing techniques and intervals, suggesting a higher technical requirement than typical rowing workouts. Therefore, Intermediate is the most appropriate level given the sprint intervals and overall drive classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features two intense 4-minute sprint intervals, which are highly demanding and reflect an intensity score of 3 out of 3. The rhythm data indicates a high stroke rate of 30, and the structure as an 'interval' workout implies high energy expenditure with limited rest, all of which align with an 'Extreme' effort difficulty. The short total duration still contains significant high-intensity work, making this workout very demanding for most users.",
