  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row,' and thus, according to the guidelines, it must include the 'Rowing machine' with a high confidence score. The title and description focus on 'Technique Cool-Down' with a format labeled as 'Technique,' suggesting that this workout is centered around proper rowing form. Despite no explicit equipment in the metadata, the presence of the 'row' category strongly implies that a rowing machine is required, justifying the 0.9 confidence score."
