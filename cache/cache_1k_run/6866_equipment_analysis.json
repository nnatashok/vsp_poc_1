  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for the workout video titled 'Technique Warm-Up' indicates that it is part of the 'row' category. This strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine, which is essential for a rowing-based technique warm-up. The description mentions practicing 'strokes with legs only, legs and core, and full strokes,' reinforcing that a rowing machine is central to the workout. Given these clear indications, a confidence score of 1.0 is assigned, meaning it is very likely the workout requires a rowing machine."
