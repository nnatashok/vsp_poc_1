  "vibesExplanation": "The Warrior Workout vibe is supported by the HIIT format, which suggests intense, sweat-dripping intervals, and the workout intensity level of 3 out of 3. These elements indicate a primal, energy-intensive session, leading to a score of 0.8. The Adrenaline Rush vibe is justified by the fast pace of the 60-second intervals, combined with a high intensity and the implied unpredictability of the 'drive' type, contributing to a score of 0.7. Finally, the Meditative Grind vibe reflects the rowing aspect that involves a rhythmic, repetitive motion, combined with Aisyah's motivational coaching, securing a 0.6 score. The music genre, with Latin and Global Hits, adds a dynamic and energetic background, enhancing the workout's vibrancy and excitement. The absence of direct music genre information limits the confidence slightly. However, due to these indicators and the advanced fitness level requirement, the confidence in vibe classification is high."
