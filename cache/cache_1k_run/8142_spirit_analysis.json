  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Flow & Rhythm'. The image depicts rowing on a river, a significant indicator for the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, earning it a strong score of 0.8. The environment suggests nature-based challenges inherent to rowing on open water. Additionally, the steady rhythm of 20 strokes per minute and the music playlist ('Love Shack' by The B-52's) suggest a rhythmic and flowing aspect to the workout, fitting the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. This earns it a moderate score of 0.6. The emphasis on maintaining a steady rhythm with synchronized strokes further supports this classification. 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' considerations were excluded due to the warm-up nature and lack of explicit high-intensity or structured training indicators."
