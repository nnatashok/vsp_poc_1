Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is relatively short at roughly 21 minutes, indicating it may not be extremely physically demanding. However, the inclusion of 1- and 2-minute intervals on Hydrow suggests moderate energy expenditure, and the format being EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute) usually implies a consistent, moderate workload. This results in a 'Moderate' effort difficulty with potential for higher end exertion ('Challenging') due to the repeated full-body focus and timing structure.",
