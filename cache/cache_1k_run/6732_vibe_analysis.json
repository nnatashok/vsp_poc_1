  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'The Warrior Workout' due to the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format and maximum intensity level (3 out of 3), which suggests a sweat-dripping, heart-pounding experience typical of a Warrior vibe. The short duration of 11 minutes adds to the explosive nature of this classification, scoring an 0.85 for the strong alignment.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Nightclub Workout' is an appropriate fit given the playlist featuring energetic tracks from artists like Shane Codd and Gryffin. The radio stations 'Dance high' and 'Global Hits' imply a rhythmic, upbeat atmosphere, aligning with the full-body euphoria of this vibe. This earns a score of 0.75, indicating a strong match.\n\nWhile the music and intensity strongly support these vibes, the outdoor rowing and lack of a specifically nightclub environment slightly moderate the perfect match, but still maintain high confidence."
