  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled 'Bodyweight Strength,' indicating that the exercises are performed using body weight without additional equipment. The metadata, including the category 'On The Mat,' strongly suggests that a mat is required. The image further confirms this, as both participants are shown sitting on mats poolside. Therefore, the primary equipment needed is a mat, with a very high confidence score of 0.9, as it is central to the setup and execution of the workout."
