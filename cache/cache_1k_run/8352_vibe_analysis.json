  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Low Rhythm Cool-Down' features a focus on proper technique and rowing at low rhythms, suggesting a calm and repetitive workout style, typical of 'The Meditative Grind.' The short duration (5:51) and emphasis on steady pacing without a fast tempo support this classification, earning it a score of 0.7. Additionally, the cool-down and intentional technique aspect aligns with 'The Zen Flow,' which emphasizes grounding and intentional movement, though this is slightly less pronounced, assigning it a score of 0.6. The playlist featuring indie and alternative songs adds a relaxing ambiance, bolstering the overall calm and steady vibes without leaning heavily into excitement or intensity typical of other vibes. This detailed analysis leads to a vibes confidence of 0.75, as the information strongly supports these vibes but could leave room for interpretation with more detailed musical influence data."
