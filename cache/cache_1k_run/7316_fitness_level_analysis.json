  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'row', thus technique difficulty can only be Beginner or Intermediate. The focus on 'power at lower rhythms' suggests a slightly increased complexity, aligning slightly with Intermediate. However, the 'sweat' type workout typically has simpler rowing movements suited for beginners, justifying strong alignment with Beginner level and minor consideration for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With an 11-minute session and 2 out of 3 intensity, there is moderate energy expenditure. The 'sweat' category indicates a more intense effort, but with a short duration mostly focused on power at lower rhythms, the challenge is moderate for deconditioned users. The short duration limits the Challenging classification to a supporting role.",
