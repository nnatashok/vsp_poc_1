  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', which typically aligns with Beginner to Intermediate levels for technique difficulty due to the rowing-based nature of the exercises. Rowing primarily involves repetitive, cyclical movements that aren't highly technical but do require coordination and correct form. The interval format suggests slight complexity, targeting an Intermediate level, but given the rowing context, Beginner is also quite applicable.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is rated as 'sweat' with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicating a substantial physical demand. The focus on watts and power, along with intervals, suggests moderate to high energy output, aligning with Moderate to Challenging levels. The short duration (11 minutes) keeps it from reaching Extreme, but requires more effort than a Light level due to its intensity and focused power component.",
