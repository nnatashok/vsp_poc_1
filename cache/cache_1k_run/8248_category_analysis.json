  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Yoga' with a high score of 0.9. The metadata indicates that this workout involves 'restorative poses' led by an instructor named Owen, and recommends yoga blocks, which are typical indicators of a yoga session. The title 'Finding Stillness Restore' suggests a focus on calming and restorative practices, which are often associated with yoga. Additionally, the category tags 'restore' and 'on-the-mat' further align with yoga practices.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Meditation,' with a score of 0.6, because 'Finding Stillness' often involves meditative elements. The music playlist, featuring acoustic and downtempo songs, suggests a serene and meditative atmosphere, which aligns with meditation and relaxation practices.\n\nThe high confidence level of 0.85 is due to strong explicit indicators in the title and description, supporting the choice of 'Yoga' and 'Meditation' categories. Other categories like 'Stretching' or 'Mat' were considered but excluded due to insufficient evidence of broader stretching or general mat exercises outside of a yoga context."
