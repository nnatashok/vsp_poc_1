  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is clearly restorative in nature, as indicated by the title 'Shoulder + Upper Back Release' and the description's mention of gently opening up muscles using a yoga strap or towel. The classification 'restore' further supports this, pointing to a focus on recovery and relaxation. The music playlist with 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' genres also aligns with a calming atmosphere. Thus, the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is a strong match with a score of 0.9.\n\nThe image suggests a natural outdoor setting in Norway, indicating elements of exploration and environmental appreciation. Therefore, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is also relevant, although less central to the workout's purpose, with a score of 0.7. The absence of energetic or structured aspects excludes spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined.' Overall, the metadata strongly supports a restorative focus with an outdoor setting."
