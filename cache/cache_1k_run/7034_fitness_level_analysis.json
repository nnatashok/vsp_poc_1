Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is under 6 minutes, typical of low energy expenditure. The format as a 'warm-up' and part of a rowing session with max rhythm of 28 suggests light cardiovascular effort. Thus, it strongly aligns with Light effort (score: 0.8). The phrase 'increase your heart rate' and alternating between 'walk and sprint pace' slightly elevates intensity, aligning moderately with Moderate effort (score: 0.4). No intense or prolonged activities suggest higher effort levels.",
