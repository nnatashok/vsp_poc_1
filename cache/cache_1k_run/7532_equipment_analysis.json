  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout metadata clearly identifies this session as 'Whole Body Pilates' under the 'On The Mat' category. Pilates workouts commonly require a mat for comfort and support during floor exercises. The image also shows an individual performing exercises on a mat in an outdoor setting, which reinforces the need for a mat. Given these points, the confidence level for needing a mat is very high at 0.9. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata or image, indicating that a mat is likely the only equipment needed for this workout."
