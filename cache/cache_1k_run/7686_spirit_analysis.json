  "spiritsExplanation": "The selected workout spirits are \"Flow & Rhythm\" and \"Outdoor & Adventure.\" \n\n\"Flow & Rhythm\" (Score: 0.75) is chosen due to the description and playlist. The description mentions warming up with shifts to higher rhythms, suggesting a movement pattern focused on continuity and coordination. The music choice, including tracks like \"Hips Don't Lie,\" reinforces this rhythmic, energetic flow.\n\n\"Outdoor & Adventure\" (Score: 0.8) is evident from the image, which shows rowing on a river. This environment leverages the natural setting, aligning with the spirit of exploration and outdoor activity. The rowing setting portrayed in the image strongly supports this classification.\n\nThe workout lacks elements specific to other spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense,\" given it's a warm-up, or \"Soothing & Restorative,\" as it's focused on raising heart rate and rhythm."
