  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily categorized as 'row,' and according to Hydrow-specific rules, Technique Difficulty can be either Beginner or Intermediate. The lack of complex movements or exercises in the metadata suggests a tendency toward Beginner level movements. However, the inclusion of an 'interval' format may require some coordination, slightly elevating it toward Intermediate. Thus, there is a strong alignment with Beginner, but some modest evidence supports Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 21 minutes and an intensity level of 2 out of 3, the workout is likely moderately challenging. The 'interval' format suggests increased energy expenditure and short rest periods, pushing the effort difficulty toward 'Challenging.' However, considering the target audience's low fitness levels, 'Moderate' is more appropriate, though there is significant consideration for 'Challenging.'",
