  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', meaning it inherently includes simpler rowing movements. The 'Interval' format with rhythm up to 28 suggests maintaining consistent pace, requiring minimal advanced technique. Despite being tagged as 'Sweat', there's no indication of complex technical cues, supporting a Beginner classification with some Intermediate elements due to interval pacing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With an 11-minute session focusing on rowing intervals at a medium intensity level of 2 out of 3, the workout demands moderate physical exertion, suitable for users slightly above beginner level, thus aligning with a light to moderate classification. The relatively short duration and presence of intervals indicate some effort without excessive strain, fitting deconditioned users.",
