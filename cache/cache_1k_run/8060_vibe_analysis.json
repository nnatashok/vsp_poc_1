  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Chest Opening Align' is focused on yoga, specifically designed to open up the chest. The description mentions optional equipment like yoga blocks, further indicating a gentle and intentional practice, aligning well with 'The Zen Flow' vibe which centers around grounding, breath-centered activity. This is supported by the playlist, which includes chill and downtempo tracks suggesting a calm atmosphere. The score is 0.75 reflecting strong alignment with 'The Zen Flow'.\n\nThe workout is 16 minutes long, suitable for recovery or relaxation before or after a row, making 'The Reboot Workout' vibe (deep stretching and low stress) a good fit with a score of 0.65. The nature of the session aligns with the intention of refreshment and gentle movement.\n\nThe outdoor setting and relaxed playlist with easy-going tracks also hint at 'The Nature Flow' vibe, though it is less defined, earning a score of 0.45. This vibe captures the tranquil, open-air background but lacks more explicit emphasis on the outdoor workout challenge aspect, hence a lower score."
