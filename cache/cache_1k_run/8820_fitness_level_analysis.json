  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of over 20 minutes, including a full-body circuit and rowing, the workout requires a moderate level of effort. The use of dumbbells and rowing, along with the format 'circuit', increase energy expenditure. Given the moderate intensity cues (max rhythm: 24) and use of equipment, it aligns strongly with a Moderate effort level (0.8). Challenging effort is less emphasized due to the beginner inclusion and manageable duration, scoring lower (0.4).",
