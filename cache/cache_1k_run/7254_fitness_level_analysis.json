Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 5 minutes and 45 seconds, classified as a cool down, suggesting low-energy expenditure focused on relaxation and lowering heart rhythm. The 'Cool Down, standard, row' category and the calming music selections indicate a predominantly Light effort difficulty. The slight potential for increased cardiovascular engagement, due to the effort of varying rhythm, minimally aligns with Moderate effort, justifying a primarily Light score with a low Moderate possibility.",
