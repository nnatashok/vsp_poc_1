  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is categorized as 'drive,' which has a default technique requirement of Intermediate for rowing-based workouts. However, since the action primarily involves rowing (Category: 'row'), this typically aligns with Beginner or Intermediate difficulty. Considering the HIIT format with a max rhythm of 32, the Intermediate level is supported, but elements remain relatively simple due to the focus on consistent rowing movements, warranting a Beginner score as well.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 21 minutes with HIIT intervals indicates a Challenging effort level. The workout intensity is marked as 3 out of 3, implying high physical demand, further supported by the sweat-inducing 32 max rhythm. Despite the short duration, the high-paced nature and intense music playlist (e.g., rock) suggest elevated energy expenditure typical for a Challenging level.",
