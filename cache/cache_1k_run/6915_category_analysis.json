  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Indoor rowing' because of the explicit reference to 'Row' in the workout name \"Club 26 Row\", indicating that it's performed on a rowing machine. The description further supports this by mentioning terms like 'rhythm 26', 'pacing', and 'intervals', which are consistent with rowing workouts, especially those that involve cadence and pacing oneself over timed intervals. The metadata specifies 'steady' format and an intensity level of 2 out of 3, suggesting a consistent rowing effort that isn't overly high in intensity, aligning with a structured rowing session rather than HIIT. The absence of any cross-training or additional equipment mentioned further cements this workout as focused on rowing alone, which justifies the high score of 1.0 for the 'Indoor rowing' category. No other categories are applicable given the specificity of the workout format and equipment involved."
