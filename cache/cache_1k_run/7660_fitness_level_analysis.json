  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout category is 'row', which inherently limits the technique difficulty level to either Beginner or Intermediate according to the Hydrow-specific rules. Rowing, even at a higher rhythm, typically involves straightforward movements that most users can execute with basic guidance. Therefore, the Beginner rating is very strongly aligned, while Intermediate fits moderately due to the interval format which may require some coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Double the Fun Row' involves a 31-minute workout with interval training, which suggests a moderate to challenging effort level for deconditioned users. This type involves moderate energy expenditure with intermediate rest periods, aligning well with Moderate effort, though the intensity of 2 out of 3 and the duration can push the boundary into Challenging for less fit users.",
