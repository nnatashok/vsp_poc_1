  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', automatically placing it between Beginner and Intermediate levels for technique difficulty. The description suggests a focus on mental toughness supported by rhythmic rowing at a max rhythm of 28, which doesn't suggest complex or technical movements beyond basic rowing techniques. Hence, the moderate use of technique aligns well with Beginner to Intermediate levels, supported by the presence of expert coaching by Dani and Nick which slightly elevates the difficulty.",
