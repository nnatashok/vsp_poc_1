  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since this is a rowing workout, the technique difficulty is generally constrained to Beginner or Intermediate. The metadata categorizes it under 'row' and mentions 'sweat', which implies a focus on effort, not technique mastery. Therefore, with a 21-minute duration and a 'climb' format, there's a minor increase in complexity compared to basic rowing, justifying a slightly higher score for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is moderate (21 minutes), and a climb format usually requires some effort due to increasing intensity. The 'sweat' type suggests a somewhat higher energy expenditure than lighter workouts. The workout intensity level is marked as 2 out of 3, supporting a Moderate effort classification with some potential challenging aspects.",
