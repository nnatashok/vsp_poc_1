  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Heart Opening Flow' suggests a yoga-based session focused on flexibility and stretching, which typically requires a yoga mat for comfort and stability during floor exercises. The category 'On The Mat' further supports this need, justifying a high confidence score of 0.9 for a mat. Yoga blocks are explicitly recommended in the description to help open the chest and shoulders, assigning a high confidence score of 0.8 for blocks. The image also shows a participant sitting on a mat with a yoga block nearby, confirming the equipment used."
