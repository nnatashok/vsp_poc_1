  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's focus is on learning the proper catch position and practicing three-quarter slide drills. These are rowing-specific movements, which typically involve basic technique rather than complex coordination, aligning with Beginner level technique. However, the focus on technique refinements like 'catch position' suggests a touch of complexity, warranting a slight Intermediate score.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'sweat' with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, suggesting moderate effort. The duration of approximately 22 minutes doesn't demand extreme physical capacity, aligning well with a Moderate level. The rowing focus typically involves continuous but not overwhelming physical exertion, suitable for low-to-medium energy expenditure, which partially aligns with Light effort as well.",
