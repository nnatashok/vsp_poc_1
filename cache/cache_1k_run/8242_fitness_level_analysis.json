  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a rowing workout with a steady pace, remaining between rhythm rates of 20 to 24, which signals consistency in movement rather than complex maneuvers. The categorization under 'Breathe' indicates a focus on maintaining a comfortable rhythm, which aligns with the Beginner level assessment. Given that the workout is classified as 'row', technique difficulty is limited to beginner and intermediate options. The strong alignment with Beginner-level techniques is also supported by the Beginner fitness level requirement.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 11 minutes and 20 seconds long at a steady pace with an intensity level rated as 1 out of 3, suggesting that it is designed to be light and gentle. The description emphasizes a focus on breathing and maintaining a steady rhythm rather than high-intensity effort, aligning well with the Light effort difficulty level. The use of music and storytelling further supports a relaxing atmosphere, contributing to the Light classification. Therefore, it is classified primarily as Light with a conservative inclusion of Moderate, considering the overarching focus of Hydrow rowing sessions.",
