  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing session with a 'breathe' focus, indicating a relaxation and form emphasis rather than complex movement. The keywords 'steady', 'breathe', and absence of advanced technique cues suggest a simple rowing pattern. As per Hydrow's rules, row workout technique difficulty is naturally capped at Intermediate. Here, the simplicity and pace (rhythms 20 to 24) align closely with a Beginner category.",

Keywords like 'cruise' and the appreciate focus on mindfulness ('steady' and 'breathe') support this light intensity classification. These factors collectively align with a Light effort difficulty, though the marginal increase to a 24 rhythm may slightly edge towards Moderate.",
