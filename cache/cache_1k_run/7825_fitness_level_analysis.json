  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 5 minutes and 44 seconds, categorizing it as short. Its purpose as a 'warm-up' suggests a focus on gentle preparation of the body, indicating low energy expenditure. The rhythm climbing format with no mention of high-intensity cues implies a low-demand activity, appropriate for a light effort categorization. Therefore, the effort difficulty is classified as 'Light' with a strong score of 1.0 and very high confidence.",
