  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout 'Pause Drill Cool-Down' is primarily an \"Indoor rowing\" session. This is informed by the emphasis on 'pause drills,' which is a rowing technique, and 'Connecticut River,' suggesting a rowing context, despite it likely being simulated rather than on water. The term 'technique' indicates a focus on refining form, supporting the 'Indoor rowing' classification with a score of 0.7 due to the strong connection to rowing activities. The secondary category is 'Stretching' due to the term 'Cool-Down' in the workout description signifying a reduction in intensity which often aligns with stretching exercises. This is scored at 0.5, reflecting a moderate presence. While the music genres mentioned (Country, Global Hits) do not directly influence the classification, they complement the relaxed nature of a cool-down."
