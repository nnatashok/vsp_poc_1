  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Endurance Building Row' is characterized by its relaxed intensity and focus on steady rhythm. The use of terms like 'steady' and 'breathe' suggest a Flow & Rhythm spirit (score: 0.7), as the session encourages maintaining a smooth, continuous motion while being mindful of coordination and music-driven pacing. The playlist, featuring mellow pop hits such as 'Elastic Heart (Piano Version)' and 'Bird Set Free,' further supports this spirit by providing a background conducive to maintaining flow.\n\nAdditionally, the workout's low intensity (level 1 out of 3) and emphasis on personal reflection (\"Find your why\") align with a Soothing & Restorative spirit (score: 0.6), aimed at providing a relaxing, stress-reducing experience. The keywords about motivation and accountability also imply a reflective, restorative approach.\n\nThe image confirms an Outdoor & Adventure spirit (score: 0.8), as the session is conducted on a river, providing a nature-based environment. This setting naturally embodies exploration and connection with the outdoors, enhancing the adventurous aspect of this workout."
