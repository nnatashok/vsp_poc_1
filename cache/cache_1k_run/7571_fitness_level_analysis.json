Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "A 15-minute duration for a mobility workout categorizes the energy expenditure as light, suitable for complete beginners or those in poor physical condition. The session likely involves low-intensity movements without additional equipment, focusing more on gentle stretching rather than cardiovascular or muscular exertion. The brief nature and the low-intensity content support a 'Light' scoring predominantly, with a secondary 'Moderate' score applicable only if some movements deviate slightly towards increased, but not strenuous, effort.",
