  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'row,' which restricts technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The rowing movement at a rhythm of 22 with intervals at 26 suggests a simple rowing technique that doesn't demand high coordination, aligning mostly with the Beginner level. However, the presence of rhythm changes introduces a slight layer of complexity, justifying a small Intermediate score.",
