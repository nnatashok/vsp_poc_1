  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a cool down session, characterized by low intensity and short duration (under 6 minutes). The main aim is to gradually bring the heart rate and rhythm down, not to exert energy, which aligns with a Light Effort Difficulty. The description suggests a relaxing session that would not challenge less fit users, confirmed by the maximum rhythm value of 20 that indicates very low-intensity activity.",
