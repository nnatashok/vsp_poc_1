  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'row' and 'drive', which historically aligns with intermediate technique complexity. Rowing requires coordination and rhythm, but as a foundational exercise, it's typically not highly technically complex beyond the intermediate level. The absence of additional technical movements in the metadata supports this classification at an intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 46 minutes long with 3, 2, and 1-minute intervals, which can be quite physically demanding, as intervals require sustained energy output. The workout intensity is noted as 3 out of 3, suggesting maximum effort. The max rhythm of 34+ strokes per minute indicates a high level of cardiovascular engagement, justifying the extreme classification.",
