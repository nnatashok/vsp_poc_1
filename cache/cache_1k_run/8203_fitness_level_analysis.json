The metadata description indicates a focus on 'low rhythms' and 'steady meters', which suggests straightforward rowing without complex movements. Additionally, the 'breathe' workout type aligns with a lower technique alluding to simplicity, targeting less complex maneuvers suitable for Beginners.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'steady row' with a 'low rhythm' capped at 22, indicative of a less intense, more manageable pace. The effort difficulty is further suggested to be light due to the description of the workout as 'celebrating taking time for yourself'. Additionally, with a 'workout intensity level' of 1 out of 3 and a duration of only 16 minutes, the energy expenditure remains low, fitting well within a 'Light' categorization.",
