  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout 'Feel Good Row' is classified under the 'breathe' category with a format tagged as 'Steady' and low rhythms maxing at 22. This indicates a consistent, simple rowing activity that involves basic mechanics more aligned with a Beginner level. For rowing, the exercises typically do not extend beyond Beginner or Intermediate unless specifically indicated as complex, which is not the case here. The absence of an instructor further suggests a simplification towards Beginner level movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is short at 16 minutes and 23 seconds, which combined with the workout intensity level rated as 1 out of 3, and the 'breathe' type, suggests a relatively minimal energy expenditure, positioning it within a Light effort difficulty category. The description highlights 'taking time for yourself' and 'accumulate steady meters,' both indicating a leisurely pace suitable for less fit individuals. However, maintaining a steady rhythm might lightly touch the Moderate effort boundary for a complete beginner.",
