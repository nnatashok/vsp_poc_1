  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Strength' is primarily characterized by a focus on core strengthening in a quick and efficient format. The elements of repetition and strengthening align with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, which captures the zone-in, lock-down nature of core work, scoring 0.7. The playlist, featuring upbeat tracks from Martin Garrix and Disclosure, provides a beat-driven energy that suggests a 'Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, scored at 0.6, with music-infused, strong but fluid movements. The use of dance and global hits hints at a 'Groove Session' vibe, scored at 0.4, adding a touch of fun and expressiveness to the workout. The short duration and lack of high-intensity indicators reduce the fit for more intense or competitive vibes."
