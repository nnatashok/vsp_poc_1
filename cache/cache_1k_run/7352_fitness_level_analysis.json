  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'Drive' within the category 'row' implies a focus on powerful, technical rowing which aligns with Intermediate-level technique difficulty. This is because rowing can become quite technical when incorporating elements like 'legs only into full strokes'. Although categorized under Hydrow's rules as 'Drive' requiring proficient pacing and rhythm, the inherent nature of rowing allows it to be rated no higher than Intermediate based on Hydrow's specific distinction. Nevertheless, the inclusion of specialized drills indicates a strong lean towards Intermediate technique difficulty (Score: 0.8).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'Power' with a high max rhythm of 34 and is rated with an intensity of 3 out of 3. The 16:27-minute duration suggests sustained effort, typically associated with high-intensity workouts. Given the \"Drive\" nature and description of moving from 'legs only into full strokes' and 'accelerating to higher rhythms', energy expenditure is significant and rest periods likely minimal. Thus, the effort difficulty aligns primarily with Extreme (Score: 0.8), given the standard ratings. However, considering the potential accessibility for depreciation of fit beginners, a Challenging level is also reasonable (Score: 0.6).",
