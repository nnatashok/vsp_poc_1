Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short cool-down with a duration of 5 minutes and 51 seconds, intended to help users relax and recover rather than exert energy. The classification of 'cool down' in combination with low-intensity content and light music genres suggests that the workout has very low energy expenditure. Therefore, the effort difficulty strongly aligns with 'Light' at a confidence level of 0.9. It's gentle enough for users still needing recovery after their main workout session, hence the score of 0.95 for 'Light'.",
