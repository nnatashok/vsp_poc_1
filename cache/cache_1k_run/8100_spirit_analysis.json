  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Pick Drill + Power Warm-Up' is classified with a primary spirit of 'Structured & Disciplined' due to its focus on technique refinement and power activation. The description mentions it as a 'technical and power-focused warm-up,' which indicates a need for precision and methodical training\u2014hallmarks of a structured approach. This is reinforced by terms like 'Refine your technique' and the specified format as 'Technique.'\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also applicable given that the setting is on a river, as evidenced by the image and setting. This environment introduces natural elements and exploration, aligning with the outdoor spirit. The photo highlights a serene and adventurous outdoor rowing setting. \n\nThe moderate to high rhythm of 28 and brief duration support the focus on warm-up rather than high-energy intensity. While it involves some activation and rhythm, the evidence does not strongly support a \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Flow & Rhythm\" classification due to the technical, methodical emphasis."
