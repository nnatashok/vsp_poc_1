  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is short (under 6 minutes) and designed as a warm-up, which typically aims to gradually increase heart rate and prepare for more intense activity. This suggests a Light effort level. The rhythm climb aspect introduces a slight increase in energy demand, which fits into the Moderate level as an introductory challenge for deconditioned users. Given the short duration and format, the primary alignment is Light with Moderate as a secondary consideration.",
