  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', which typically allows only for Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty. Given the workout is focused on a rhythm-based rowing session and doesn't introduce complex movements, it aligns more closely with Beginner technique difficulty. The influence of Latin music and interval formatting adds a minor layer of complexity, supporting a slight alignment with Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of 21 minutes and is described using indicators such as 'sweat' and 'Intervals', with a 2/3 intensity level, suggesting it is moderately demanding. The rhythmic, music-driven format combined with the motivational influence of an Olympian instructor slightly elevates the effort level. Nonetheless, 'sweat' suggests moderate energy expenditure, aligning mainly with a 'Moderate' effort difficulty and a modest alignment to 'Challenging'.",
