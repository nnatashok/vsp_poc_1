  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Find Your Legs Row' and falls under the 'row' category, strongly indicating the use of a rowing machine. The description also mentions 'cruising down the Charles River,' which refers to rowing as a simulation of outdoor rowing. Furthermore, the high intensity level and the 'Intervals' format suggest the use of a rowing machine for cardiovascular and endurance training. Although the image shows actual rowing on water, for an indoor workout, this would translate to using a rowing machine, thus supporting the classification with high confidence."
