Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as a 'warm-up', typically involving lower intensity and shorter duration. The workout lasts 11 minutes, which is a relatively short duration geared towards warming up rather than exertion. The focus on technique and efficiency over intensity further supports a 'Light' classification. However, since it involves rowing and operates at a rhythm of up to 28, there is a slight alignment with 'Moderate' effort, but the overall focus remains on technique rather than exertion.",
