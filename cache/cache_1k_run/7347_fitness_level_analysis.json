  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short row-based warm-up lasting 11 minutes, mainly focused on technique refinement. This implies low energy expenditure, as warm-ups are designed to prepare the body without significant fatigue. The format indicates that intensity will not be high, aligning with typical attributes of a 'Light' effort difficulty. There are no indications of high-paced or intense elements that would elevate the effort level.",
