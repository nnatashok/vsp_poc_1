  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Stretching' with high confidence based on the explicit mention of 'Essential Stretches for Your Back' in the title and a confirmation of this focus in the description, which details using a foam roller to stretch major back muscles. The duration of 10 minutes and 45 seconds is typical for a targeted stretching routine. The metadata explicitly labels the workout type as 'stretching' and includes categories 'On The Mat,' which further suggests floor-based stretching exercises. The inclusion of a foam roller is consistent with targeted muscle stretching routines. The absence of other detailed physical activities or equipment suggests no significant overlap with other workout categories, reaffirming the exclusive focus on stretching. Due to these strong indicators, the confidence level for including 'Stretching' as a primary category is very high."
