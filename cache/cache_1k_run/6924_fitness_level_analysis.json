  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is brief at around 11 minutes, which suggests low overall energy expenditure. Yoga flows typically involve sustained yet gentle movement, which aligns more with light to moderate effort, especially with relaxing background music indicated in the playlist. While 'flow' may imply some continuous movement, the absence of vigorous intensity cues or challenging sequences suggests a primarily light workout suitable for beginners with moderate effort only for slightly engaged participants.",
