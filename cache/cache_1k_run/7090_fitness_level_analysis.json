  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is only 1 minute and 46 seconds long, indicating low duration and effort expenditure. While Pilates can be physically engaging due to stabilization and control aspects, the short nature of this session implies a very light effort difficulty. The technique itself, 'the hundred,' while challenging in endurance, doesn't escalate the overall effort to a higher level of exertion.",
