Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short-duration cool down with a focus on rhythm rowing. The cool-down nature (5 minutes 40 seconds) typically results in low energy expenditure and low physical demand. The activity primarily involves maintaining rhythm at lower stroke rates, which would align strongly with a 'Light' effort level. Some potential for moderate effort exists due to rhythm practice, but overall, it aligns closely with a Light difficulty.",
