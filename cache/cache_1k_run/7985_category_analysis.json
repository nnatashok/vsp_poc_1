  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as a 'Speed Builder Row,' which strongly suggests the primary exercise is rowing. The description highlights 'high-intensity intervals' with specified durations of '2-minute and 1-minute,' which aligns with High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) principles, indicating alternating periods of intense and rest phases. The given maximum rhythm of 28 could also point to rowing strokes per minute, reinforcing the focus on rowing. The workout type is described as 'sweat,' which supports the high-intensity nature of the session, commonly associated with both indoor rowing and HIIT categories. The intensity level is specified as '2 out of 3,' indicating a moderate to high intensity suitable for these categories. While the absence of direct evidence for any other category precludes them from being selected, the lack of any mention of bodyweight exercises, Pilates, yoga, or other equipment-based workouts justifies exclusion of those options. The confidence for 'Indoor rowing' is particularly high (0.9) given the detailed indicators pointing towards rowing activities."
