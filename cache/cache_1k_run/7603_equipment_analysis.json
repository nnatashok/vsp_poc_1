  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Unleashed Row\" and explicitly belongs to the category type 'row', which implies the use of a rowing machine. The metadata does not specify any additional equipment, and the focus on rowing intervals at a max pace supports the necessity of a rowing machine. The confidence score for the rowing machine is very high (1.0) because both the title and category clearly indicate its central role in the workout."
