  "spiritsExplanation": "The spirit 'High-Energy & Intense' is chosen with a score of 0.9 due to the high intensity level (3 out of 3) and the focus on generating power, as indicated in the title and description: 'Establishing Max Effort Row' and 'power-focused row.' The workout's rhythm (max 30) and music choices (high-energy dance and global hits) further align with an intense experience. \n\nThe spirit 'Outdoor & Adventure' is assigned a score of 0.7 due to the context of rowing on a river, suggested by the image provided. The outdoor nature and exploration aspects are implied by the natural setting, supporting the adventure spirit.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Flow & Rhythm' were not selected due to the workout's clear focus on intensity and power rather than structure, coordination, or rhythmic flow."
