  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is mainly characterized by a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, indicated by the description 'climb in rhythm' and the presence of music-driven pacing with pop and global hits music, scoring 0.75. This points to a session that emphasizes continuous and coordinated movement.\n\nThe image and context of rowing on a river suggest an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit with a score of 0.7. The natural setting enhances an adventurous quality, even though this is not explicitly stated in the metadata.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is also relevant, scored at 0.6, due to the \u2018sweat\u2019 workout type and the moderate intensity level (2 out of 3), suggesting a vigorous workout element.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the lack of explicit technical or recovery focus in the description and metadata."
