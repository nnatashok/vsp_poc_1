  "categoriesExplanation": "The title 'Post-Row Mobility' and the description emphasizing 'back and hip mobility' suggest a focus on flexibility and range of motion, which aligns well with the 'Stretching' category. Although the category tags include 'On The Mat,' the mention of mobility exercises for recovery after rowing indicates exercises likely involve stretching rather than generic floor work, justifying a high score of 0.7 in Stretching. The 'Mat' category is also applicable considering the 'On The Mat' tag, hence its inclusion with a score of 0.6, reflecting its relevance but secondary emphasis compared to Stretching. The metadata lacks elements typically associated with active or dynamic workouts, thus excluding categories like HIIT or Body weight. The absence of specific serene elements or meditative focus ruled out Yoga and Meditation. Moderate confidence (0.75) indicates clear indicators but acknowledges potential variation in how 'mobility' might be interpreted."
