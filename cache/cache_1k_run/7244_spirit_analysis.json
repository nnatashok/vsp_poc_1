  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Steady Row' emphasizes a steady, low-intensity pace, perfectly matching the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, as evidenced by its structured format into three 15-minute segments with a max rhythm of 24. The inclusion of 90s hits suggests a rhythmic, enjoyable experience, aligning well with the spirit of smooth, continuous movement. \n\nThe outdoor rowing setting in the image strongly suggests 'Outdoor & Adventure' as part of the workout spirit. The natural environment and the rowing activity on a river contribute to this spirit.\n\nThe session is categorized under 'breathe' and 'low-intensity', with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, indicating elements of relaxation and recovery, thus aligning partially with 'Soothing & Restorative'.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' do not fit due to the low-intensity and informal structure of the workout. 'Sport & Agility' is also excluded as the focus is not on athletic performance or speed."
