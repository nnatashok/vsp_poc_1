  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row,' indicating the primary equipment needed is a rowing machine. This is corroborated by the presence of an individual on a rowing boat, which suggests rowing activities. The description mentions 'climbing in rhythm and power every 30 seconds,' which aligns with rowing exercises that include intervals and power components. The confidence score is very high, at 0.9, because the category and image both strongly indicate the necessity of a rowing machine for this warm-up."
