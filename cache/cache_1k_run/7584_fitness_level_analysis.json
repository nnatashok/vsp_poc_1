  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout category 'row' dictates that the technique difficulty can only be Beginner or Intermediate. Given the workout type 'breathe' and a rhythm of 18 to 26 in a progressive climb format, this suggests a basic rowing session with an increasing pace. The lack of complex maneuvers and the 'versatility' description suggest simplicity in technique, reinforcing a Beginner level classification. Intermediate score is lower due to potential need for coordination in rhythm change.",
