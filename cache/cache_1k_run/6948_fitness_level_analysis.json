  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Drive', which Hydrow specifically associates with Advanced technique difficulty due to potentially complex and technical rowing movements. The HIIT format, involving sprints with specific rhythm targets, requires participants to maintain proper form under fatigue, demanding a higher level of skill and coordination. Despite being a rowing workout, the 'Drive' category sets a higher baseline.",
