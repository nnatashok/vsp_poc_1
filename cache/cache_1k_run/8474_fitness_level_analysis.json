  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 20 minutes and the circuit format with `EMOM` intervals suggest significant physical exertion, while the inclusion of dumbbells implies added resistance. The workout includes total body work off the Hydrow, implying a combination of cardio and strength training, which increases energy expenditure. The max rhythm of 26 and the genre of music imply a more engaging, energetic environment, elevating the effort level slightly beyond moderate to also include challenging for users who are less fit.",
