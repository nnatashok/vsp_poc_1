  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of only 10 minutes and 38 seconds, the workout is relatively short, aligning well with a Light effort difficulty. Pilates can increase physical demand if executed with intensity but given the lying down position and lack of intensity cues, it suggests a lower energy expenditure suitable for Light difficulty. The possible inclusion of some core challenging elements hints at a Moderate level as well, particularly for less fit users.",
