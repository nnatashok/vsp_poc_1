  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'All in One Row' embodies a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as indicated by several elements: the use of 'high intensity intervals' in the description, a 'maximum rhythm' setting of 30, and an 'intensity level' of 3 out of 3. These details ensure a high confidence level (0.9) in this classification.\n\nAn 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also present, supported by the image showing rowing on a river, engaging with natural settings, and exploring the environment. This aligns strongly and justifies a high score of 0.8.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is considered due to the music selection, which includes rhythmic dance and global hits, suggesting a connection to pacing and musical coherence, earning a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nOther spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded as there was a lack of indicators around methodical progression or technical training protocols. Similarly, 'Soothing & Restorative' is absent due to the high intensity focus, and 'Sport & Agility' was less emphasized compared to the adventure and intensity elements."
