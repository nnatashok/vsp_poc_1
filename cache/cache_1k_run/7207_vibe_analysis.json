  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Speed Splits Row' displays clear elements of 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its focus on 'high intensity intervals' and the short duration of 31 minutes, which are characteristic of explosive Tabata-style or sprint workouts. The music playlist, featuring upbeat and high-energy tracks like Ed Sheeran's remixes, further supports this vibe by enhancing the electrifying quality of the workout (score: 0.85).\n\nThere are also elements of 'The Warrior Workout' with the stated 'attack high intensity intervals' suggesting a primal and intense energy characteristic of HIIT and bootcamp styles (score: 0.7).\n\nFinally, 'The Adrenaline Rush' is a fitting secondary vibe due to the 'Row' and 'Drive' format, which may introduce unpredictable challenges typical of high-intensity and full-body workouts (score: 0.6).\n\nThis classification has a high confidence level as the metadata provides explicit indicators such as the workout type, intensity level, and music style."
