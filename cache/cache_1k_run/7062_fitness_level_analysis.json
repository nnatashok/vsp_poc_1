  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' which limits technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. Given the inclusion of 'Interval' format, the workout might include varying stroke rates or patterns, indicating a mix of beginner and intermediate levels. The presence of a rhythmic element to the rowing (Max rhythm: 30) suggests some degree of coordination, which aligns more strongly with 'Beginner' due to minimal complexity compared to more technical rowing formats.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 16:26 minutes with an intensity of 2 out of 3 suggests moderate to challenging effort. The interval format indicates periods of increased effort, and the high-energy pop music is likely to drive motivation and pace. These factors suggest moderate to challenging effort for users with low fitness, with the balance leaning towards 'Moderate' given the sub-20 minute duration.",
