The description does not specify any complex rowing techniques or advanced moves, suggesting straightforward rowing. Thus, a Beginner level is highly applicable, with some acknowledgement of potential rhythm and interval challenges that could borderline on Intermediate, though minimal.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 16 minutes and 26 seconds, combined with an intensity level of 2 out of 3 and the format 'Interval', indicates a workout that is physically engaged, but not overly taxing, suggesting Moderate Difficulty. Interval training raises the effort slightly towards Challenging due to its nature of alternating high exertion and rest periods; however, it remains feasible for less fit individuals to complete.",
