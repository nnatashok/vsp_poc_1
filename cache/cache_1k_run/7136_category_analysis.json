  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout title 'Finding Breath and Stillness Restore' and description emphasizing 'feel your breath in each pose' suggest a practice focusing on mindful breathing and calmness, aligning well with a Yoga classification. The mention of 'restorative practice' and 'on-the-mat' further supports this, as it typically involves gentle, supported poses aimed at relaxation, common in Yoga. The low-tempo music genres like 'chill low' and 'cool/downtempo' indicate a tranquil atmosphere, characteristic of Yoga and Meditation. The mention of 'Finding Breath and Stillness' also leans towards Meditation, as these terms frequently relate to meditative practices. The absence of equipment strengthens the likelihood of a mat-based session typical of Yoga. Therefore, Yoga is assigned a higher score (0.8) due to stronger emphasis on poses, while Meditation is also relevant (score 0.6) reflecting the focus on breath and stillness. The categories confidence is high (0.9) due to consistent evidence across metadata."
