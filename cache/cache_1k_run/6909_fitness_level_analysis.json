  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a short duration of approximately 15 minutes and cues like 'calming' and 'restorative,' the effort required is likely low. This aligns with a 'Light' difficulty level, appropriate for a deconditioned audience. The short length and chill music genre further support this assessment. Moderate effort is also acknowledged due to potential mindfulness practices, but the primary classification is Light.",
