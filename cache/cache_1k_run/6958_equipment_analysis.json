  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row,' which strongly indicates the use of a 'Rowing machine.' The image of the individual rowing further supports this, so the confidence level is very high at 1.0. Additionally, the workout description mentions 'stretching,' which often requires a 'Mat' for comfort and support while performing hamstring and back stretches. Although not explicitly stated, this type of equipment is strongly implied in the context of floor-based stretching exercises, giving it a high confidence score of 0.6."
