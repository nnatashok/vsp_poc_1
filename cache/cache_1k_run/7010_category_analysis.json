  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Yoga' with a high confidence score of 0.9, supported by the mention of 'Yoga Flow' in the title, which implies a yoga-based workout involving a series of poses or sequences. The description mentions a \"brisk flow,\" reinforcing the dynamic aspect of a yoga session. Additionally, 'flow' is a term specifically associated with yoga practices. The music description, which involves upbeat and chill tracks, complements a yoga flow session. \n\nSecondly, the 'Mat' category is also applicable with a moderate score of 0.7 due to the mention of \"On The Mat\" in the category section, indicating that the exercises are performed on a mat typically used in yoga sessions. The absence of any additional equipment further strengthens the mat usage, typical for yoga and general mat exercises.\n\nOther categories like 'Stretching', 'Meditation', or 'Breathing exercises' are not considered because the metadata emphasizes a dynamic flow, which is more aligned with Yoga than these other categories that focus on slower, more static movements."
