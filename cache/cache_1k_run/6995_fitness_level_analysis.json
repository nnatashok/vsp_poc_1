Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 20-minute duration of the workout, combined with its circuit style description, suggests moderate energy expenditure. Pilates often involves sustained, controlled exercises that can elevate the heart rate but not to extreme levels. The music selection implies a dynamic, but not necessarily intense, pace. The absence of any mention of high intensity, long duration, or complex equipment use further supports a moderate effort difficulty classification, suitable for lower fitness levels.",
