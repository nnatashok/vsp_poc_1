  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is strongly categorized as 'Indoor Rowing' with a score of 0.8 due to the mention of '3 Points of Contact for every stroke' and the category tag of 'row', which clearly indicates rowing activity, potentially on an ergometer. The phrase '3 Points of Contact' suggests a focus on technique in rowing rather than exercising in other modalities. The 'warm-up' type supports the view of preparing muscles for more intensive rowing. A 'Mat' classification is considered with a lower score of 0.4 due to the 'warm-up' nature and the absence of explicit rowing machine usage, which might include some floor or technique exercises. However, the lack of explicit mention of floor exercises minimizes the certainty of this category. Overall, the rowing context is most evident, and other categories like Yoga or Stretching were excluded due to lack of relevant descriptors."
