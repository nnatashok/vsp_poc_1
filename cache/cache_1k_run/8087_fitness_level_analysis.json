  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is centered around rowing (category: row), which involves basic to moderately complex movements. Although maintaining a rhythm at a max pace of 28 could require some coordination, the fundamental rowing technique aligns well with the Beginner to Intermediate range. Given the 'row' category and user fitness level requirement stated as 'Intermediate', the primary classification is Intermediate, supported by the interval format which incrementally increases the complexity slightly above a basic level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts 21 minutes with an interval format, suggesting bouts of intense physical effort. The intensity level is marked as 2 out of 3, indicative of a moderate overall effort with moments approaching challenging. Music tempo (Indie Alternative, Global Hits) and ramping rhythm to 28 signify increased energy demands. Despite this, the overall duration and reflection on intensity suggest it remains between Moderate and Challenging for less fit users.",
