  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Mat' with a high confidence score of 0.8 due to the title and category tags indicating 'On The Mat,' which suggests floor exercises typically characteristic of mat workouts. The description emphasizes 'mobility and functional movement for runners' along with 'strength building exercises,' hinting at a combination of exercises performed on the mat, which are often bodyweight based.\n\nThe 'Body weight' category is also relevant with a score of 0.6, as the description suggests strength building exercises, typically associated with bodyweight or minimal equipment routines. The title 'Runner's Program' implies a focus on exercises that benefit runners, possibly involving functional movements and bodyweight exercises to enhance strength without heavy equipment.\n\nThe music and playlist are upbeat, matching the standard dynamic of mat and bodyweight workouts. No other categories like 'Strength' with weights are explicitly implied by the available equipment or context."
