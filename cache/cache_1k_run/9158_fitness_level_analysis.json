  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts 30 minutes, which is a significant duration for bodyweight training. 'Increase your heart rate' suggests a moderately intense workout with a focus on raising cardiovascular activity through continuous exercises. The participation of two trainers also hints at a structured format with varying intensity. As such, a moderate effort classification is highly relevant, and a challenging rating is also possible due to the potential for less rest between exercises.",
