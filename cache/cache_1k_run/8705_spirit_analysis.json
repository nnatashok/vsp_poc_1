  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Chicago Cool-Down' is set on the Chicago River, which strongly suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.9). This is supported by the nature setting, which classifies it as an Outdoor workout by default according to platform guidelines. The workout is described as a 'cool down' and focuses on steady technique improvement, aligning with a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit (score: 0.7), emphasizing recovery and relaxation. Mike Dostal's emphasis on technique and his championship background suggest elements of a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (score: 0.4), where the focus is on precision and methodical improvement. The high confidence level of 0.85 is due to the clear indicators of outdoor setting and cool-down nature. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Flow & Rhythm', and 'Sport & Agility' are not applicable due to the low-paced, restorative nature of the session, and lack of explicit competitive or fast-paced indicators."
