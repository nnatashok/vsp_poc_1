  "vibesExplanation": "The chosen vibes for 'Twists Restorative Yoga' mainly hinge on the restorative nature and setting described. The primary vibe, 'The Zen Flow,' is selected due to the focus on 'gently lengthen and twist,' which suggests a grounding and breath-centered practice typical of slow-flow yoga. The 'Reboot Workout' vibe aligns well with the restorative aspect, aimed at a total-body refresh through gentle movement. Finally, 'The Deep Recharge' is considered as the session supports a nervous system reset with its calming, low-intensity nature. The use of 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' music complements these vibes, reinforcing a calm and unhurried environment, though the absence of specific music genre details does add slight ambiguity, giving a solid confidence level of 0.8."
