  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 20:40, this workout suggests a session long enough to engage the body without pushing towards intense exertion. Pilates typically involves sustained, controlled movements that could be challenging for the unfit but are generally low-impact. The absence of equipment and the music playlist with mid-tempo pop tracks indicate a gentle yet engaging session, aligning well with Light to Moderate effort categories for less conditioned users.",
