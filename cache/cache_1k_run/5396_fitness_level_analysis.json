  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'row' caps the Technique Difficulty at Intermediate, but given the metadata, particularly the 'standard' row categorization and user fitness level requirement of 'Beginner', the Technique Difficulty is predominantly Beginner. The class description emphasizes accountability rather than complex rowing techniques, indicating minimal coordination requirement.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of over 30 minutes, this class could be moderately physically demanding, yet the workout intensity level is only 1 out of 3, indicative of a less strenuous effort. The focus on 'endurance' and rhythm max of 30 suggests some mild intensity, but overall, it remains accessible to less conditioned users. The format 'climb' could require more energy, but its classification under 'breathe' lessens total effort.",
