  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing session, hence the technique difficulty primarily falls into Beginner or Intermediate. The description emphasizes skill with varying rhythms, which suggests a need for some coordination, thus aligning with an Intermediate level. However, it remains accessible at a Beginner level due to the primary rowing movement focus, which is generally non-technical.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of over 16 minutes and a focus on maintaining consistent power, this workout demands significant endurance from participants, particularly given the rhythm challenges. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicates it's designed to be quite demanding physically. This aligns strongly with a Challenging effort level and partially with Extreme for users who are not conditioned.",
