  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, geared towards International Women's Day, has a festive and empowering theme, as reflected in song choices like 'Good As Hell' by Lizzo and 'Respect' by Aretha Franklin. These tracks support 'The Groove Session' vibe, indicating a fun and expressive workout though this is secondary due to not being dance-based, earning a score of 0.5.\n\nThe interval format, along with the climb structure and moderately high rhythm of 30, point towards 'The Endorphin Wave.' This vibe signifies an elevated, feel-good movement with a steady build, justified by the consistent effort over four-minute intervals, scored at 0.75.\n\nAdditionally, the focus on rowing and repetition aligns with 'The Meditative Grind', which emphasizes zoned-in endurance. The integration of rock and global hits provides energetic and engaging accompaniment, justifying a score of 0.65.\n\nThe workout's medium intensity (level 2 out of 3) and its inherent nod to empowerment and celebration minimize the fit for high-intensity vibes, with no extreme challenges or speed elements noted."
