  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized by intervals of varying lengths, which is a strong indicator of a HIIT-style session and fits the description of 'The Firestarter' vibe. The presence of music by The Prodigy, known for its high-energy and intense beats, aligns well with the 'Dance high, Global Hits' radio stations, suggesting an electrifying atmosphere (score: 0.75).\n\nAdditionally, the workout's high intensity level (3 out of 3) and short duration, combined with the driving beats, contribute to an 'Adrenaline Rush' experience, enhancing the feeling of unpredictability and full-body engagement (score: 0.7).\n\nThe name 'Confidence Builder Row' and the high-intensity intervals also lean towards 'The Warrior Workout,' as it emphasizes unleashing energy and pushing physical limits (score: 0.6).\n\nAlternative vibes like 'The Competitor' were considered due to the interval format but were excluded due to the lack of gamified or leaderboard elements. Similarly, 'The Nightclub Workout' was not fitting since the focus appeared more on intensity than euphoria."
