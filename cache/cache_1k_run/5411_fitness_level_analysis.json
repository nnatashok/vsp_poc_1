  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout spans 45 minutes, which is substantially long. Yoga 'flow' can be gentle but engaging when performed continuously. Given Owen's background, the session likely balances exertion with relaxation, moderately challenging users as they progress through what might become more intense flows over time. The lack of equipment implies reliance on bodyweight, lending to Moderate effort overall, with some potential for a Challenging level due to the length and fluidity required.",
