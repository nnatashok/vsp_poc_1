  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, categorized under 'row', adheres to Hydrow's classification of only Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty levels. Given it's conducted by an expert instructor, yet involves rhythmic and climbing intervals that are typical of rowing, the technique remains straightforward. The metadata points to this being accessible even for beginners due to the low complexity of rowing-based movements, thus a high Beginner score.",
