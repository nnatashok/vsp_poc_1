  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Cross Training Row' and falls under the category 'row,' which strongly implies that a rowing machine is central to this workout. The description mentions focusing on proper technique, further supporting the use of a rowing machine, as technique is a key aspect of rowing workouts. Despite the lack of explicit mention in the equipment field, the context provided by the title and category justifies a very high confidence score of 0.9 for the rowing machine."
