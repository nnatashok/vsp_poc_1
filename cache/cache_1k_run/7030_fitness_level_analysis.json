  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive', which according to Hydrow's specific rules, should be classified under 'Advanced' for Technique Difficulty as it typically involves complex rowing patterns that require skill. However, given the rules that for a 'row' category (here under a 'Drive' subcategory), the Technique Difficulty can only be rated as 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate'. Therefore, considering the 'high intensity' mention and Mike's description as a skilled rower focusing on connection and community, 'Intermediate' is a strong candidate, with the score being significantly higher based on the format 'Pyramid', which suggests moderate complexity in execution.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 11:25 indicates a short yet intense session. The session is labeled as a 'high intensity drive', and scoring a 3 out of 3 on intensity further suggests significant energy expenditure. The pyramid format, typically involving escalating effort, combines with these elements to rate the Effort Difficulty as 'Challenging'. The max rhythm of 36 indicates rapid pace, with 'Extreme' receiving a moderate score due to high demands likely made during the shorter peak periods of the pyramid style workout.",
