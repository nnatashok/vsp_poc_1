  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.8 due to its focus on technique and control, as indicated by phrases such as 'focus on control' and 'practice pausing at body over.' Additionally, the format 'Technique' and the tag 'standard' underscore a methodical, disciplined approach.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also applicable with a score of 0.7. The workout serves as a 'cool down,' a phase typically associated with relaxation and recovery from more intense sessions. The short duration of 5 minutes and 50 seconds and the specified maximum rhythm of 22 strokes per minute align with the concept of a gentle, restorative activity.\n\nThe inclusion of outdoor rowing imagery suggests a possible 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, but the focus was primarily on technique within a controlled setting, reducing its prominence in this classification."
