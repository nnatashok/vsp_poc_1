  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Technique + Quickness Warm-Up' emphasizes technique, making it a strong fit for 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe, as it focuses on skill-building and technique-driven exercises. This is reflected in the keywords 'Technique' and 'Quickness.' The music playlist includes energetic tracks by artists like Post Malone and Ludacris, adding a beat-driven element to the session, which aligns with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe. The music styles from 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits' stations suggest an engaging and upbeat session. The warm-up and standard rowing focus indicate a preparatory and skill-based approach rather than a high-intensity or competitive session, thus excluding vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.' The confidence level is moderate to high (0.65) due to clear indicators but limited explicit vibe cues."
