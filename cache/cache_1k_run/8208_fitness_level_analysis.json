Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "As a cool-down workout lasting only 5:41 minutes, the energy expenditure and physical demands are minimal. The interval format suggests a mild alternation of effort which, when combined with the short duration, aligns with a Light effort difficulty. The mention of 'two strokes with greater effort' provides some variance but remains within low intensity appropriate for recovery phases. This supports a Light classification with very minor Moderate elements.",
