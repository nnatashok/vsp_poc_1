Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'cool down' session that lasts only 5 minutes and 41 seconds, predominantly focusing on maintaining a low rhythm with alternating effort strokes. This minimal duration indicates a low level of physical demand. The cool down nature, combined with the short duration and specified rhythm, keeps the effort difficulty at a Light level, with a strong score of 0.85, indicating low energy expenditure and a relaxed pace suitable for recovery. There is a weak alignment with Moderate due to the brief periods of increased effort, but the overall intent is recovery-focused.",
