  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as 'Classical Pilates' and categorized under 'On The Mat,' strongly indicating the use of a mat for floor exercises. The attached image also shows an individual on a mat, which further supports this assessment. Therefore, a 'Mat' is identified as necessary equipment with very high confidence (0.9). No other equipment is mentioned or implied, suggesting the workout is primarily mat-based pilates."
