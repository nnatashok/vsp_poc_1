  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Endurance Climb Row,' which suggests a focus on building stamina through consistent, rhythmic effort, aligning well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The description indicates a structured, repetitive format with '4-minute intervals that climb in rhythm,' emphasizing endurance and prolonged effort. The use of upbeat, popular music in the playlists like 'Rather Be' by Clean Bandit and 'Good As Hell' by Lizzo suggests an elevated, enjoyable energy, fitting 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe. The rhythmic nature of rowing and music-driven structure also aligns with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, though less directly. The intensity level of 2 out of 3, combined with pop and global hits, supports a mix of meditative, endorphin-enhanced, and rhythmically powerful experiences. Hence, the scores reflect strong matches for these vibes given the structured endurance focus and uplifting music selection."
