  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'row' typically falls under Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty. The video is classified under 'breathe', indicating a focus on maintaining a steady effort, which aligns with less complex movements. Since the User Fitness Level Requirement is Beginner, the likely alignment is heavily in favor of a Beginner technique difficulty, despite the inclusion of interval training which might suggest slight Intermediate influences. Thus, Beginners will find it accessible, with a slight nod towards Intermediate due to interval format.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 31 minutes and 43 seconds combined with a workout intensity of 1 out of 3 suggests a Light to Moderate effort difficulty. The interval format could increase the challenge slightly, but the description highlights 'maintain a steady effort', which tempers the intensity. Based on these factors, the predominant classification is Light, with some elements reaching Moderate, considering it's accessible to Beginners.",
