  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under Indoor rowing with a score of 0.9. The title 'Reunion Row' and the description, which mentions 'return on the water together for 90\" intervals,' strongly indicate a rowing activity. The use of 'interval' format, combined with 'max rhythm: 30,' supports the classification as it suggests specific rowing cadence and structured rowing intervals typical in indoor rowing sessions. Despite the lack of explicit mention of a rowing machine, the context strongly implies its use. The workout type listed as 'sweat' and 'row' reinforces this classification. Other categories like HIIT were considered but not chosen due to the primary focus on rowing-specific intervals rather than mixed exercise modalities."
