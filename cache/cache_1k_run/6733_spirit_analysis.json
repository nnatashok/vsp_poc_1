  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Upper Body Strength with Bands' workout possesses a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.75. This is indicated by the focus on strengthening the upper body with specific equipment (resistance and mini bands), suggesting a methodical approach to improve posture and strength. The use of bands implies a structured resistance training session. The 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, scored at 0.7, is evident due to the natural outdoor setting visible in the image, where the workout takes place under a palm tree by a lake, creating a connection with nature. A 'Soothing & Restorative' element is present, with a score of 0.4, owing to the relaxing environment and the use of music that may enhance the mind-body connection despite the workout's focus on strength. The short duration also aligns with a quick, focused workout rather than an intense or prolonged session."
