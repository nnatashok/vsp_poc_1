  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly mentioned in the title and description as a 'Whole Body Stretch Pilates' session, which strongly supports categorizing it as Pilates. The description emphasizes 'reaching and stretching,' indicating that stretching is a significant component of the session, justifying a secondary classification there. The metadata states that the 'Workout Type' is pilates, and the session is meant for a whole-body approach, suggesting a comprehensive Pilates workout. No equipment is listed, aligning with standard Pilates practices that often involve body movements without special equipment. The 'On the Mat' tag in the category fields confirms that the workout is floor-based, typical for Pilates exercises. Despite the emphasis on stretching, the core classification as Pilates is supported by explicit labeling, hence the higher score for Pilates over Stretching."
