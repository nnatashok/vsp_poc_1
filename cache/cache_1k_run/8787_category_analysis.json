  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout title 'High Energy Hybrid Row' clearly indicates an indoor rowing session. The presence of terms like 'endurance,' '2-minute intervals,' and 'row' in the description suggests a rowing machine is used to perform interval training, aligning well with the typical structure of an indoor rowing workout. The 'Format: Intervals' and 'Category: row' statements further support this classification. Although 'drive, standard' might imply a broader scope, the heavy emphasis on rowing terms and the structure of intervals strongly favor the indoor rowing category. The intense music playlist and maximum rhythm of 28 also hint at a vigorous rowing session. Therefore, the category is classified as Indoor Rowing with a high confidence score of 0.9, thanks to the explicit references to rowing and interval format."
