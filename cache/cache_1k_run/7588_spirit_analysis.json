  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Breath Focused Flow' is primarily classified under the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with high confidence due to the emphasis on smooth movement ('flow') and breathing, which indicates a focus on coordination and mind-body connection. This is supported by the music choices, which include downtempo and chill tracks, further suggesting a pace that encourages flowing movements.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant with moderate confidence. The phrase 'overlooking Tuscany' in the description and the outdoor setting shown in the image suggest a connection to nature, aligning with this spirit.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is considered with moderate confidence as well. The focus on breath and the calming genre of music indicate elements of relaxation and stress reduction, common in restorative workouts.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the absence of indicators like high pace, intensity, or sports-specific elements. Similarly, 'Structured & Disciplined' does not align due to the lack of technical instructions and structured progression cues in the metadata."
