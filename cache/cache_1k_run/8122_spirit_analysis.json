  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Pick Drill + Power Warm-Up' is primarily characterized by a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit due to its focus on technique refinement and power activation, as noted in the description. The term 'technique' implies a methodical approach, and the inclusion of a specific drill supports a structured progression. Therefore, a strong score of 0.8 is assigned.\n\nAdditionally, the visual of rowing on a river signifies an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, as the natural setting is an integral part of the session. The outdoor environment is important for rowing sessions recorded in nature, so a complementary score of 0.7 is given.\n\nThe absence of intense or high-energy language, combined with the short duration of a warm-up, excludes the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. Similarly, the focus on technique over relaxation or slow flow excludes 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Flow & Rhythm' spirits."
