  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout type is 'row' and the specific format is 'Drive', which is designated as Hydrow's more advanced category, the technique difficulty can be either Beginner or Intermediate. The use of intervals and a max rhythm of 34 suggest a more coordinated and controlled rowing technique, aligning stronger with Intermediate. 'Drive' also implies more technical skill required than absolute Beginner-level workouts, though it's not reaching complexities of Advanced or Expert exercises.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a HIIT format which inherently demands high energy expenditure. With 'Drive' categorization and an intensity level of 3 out of 3, this indicates it requires significant physical effort. Although only 11 minutes long, the 1-minute intervals at a high rhythm add intensity equivalent to lengthier sessions. This situates it squarely in the Challenging category, with some possibility of being Extreme for those less conditioned due to the high intensity HIIT elements.",
