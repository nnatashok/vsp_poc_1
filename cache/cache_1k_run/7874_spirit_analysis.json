  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Guided Row: Find Your Stride' primarily embodies the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, with high confidence (score: 0.8). The description refers to it as a 'journey overlooking Charleston,' indicating an outdoor, nature-based setting. The image strengthens this with a visual of rowing on a river at sunset, a hallmark of outdoor exploration. Words like 'journey' and the specific mention of Charleston suggest an immersive adventure experience. Furthermore, smooth rowing at 'max rhythm 22' aligns well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, where coordination and pacing are emphasized (score: 0.7). The choice of music by Grateful Dead, known for its rhythmic and flowing style, further supports this spirit. The absence of high-intensity indicators rules out the 'High-Energy & Intense' category, while the lack of a strict methodological focus makes 'Structured & Disciplined' inapplicable. The session's natural ambiance and rhythmic music set a defining tone for a guided but exploratory rowing experience."
