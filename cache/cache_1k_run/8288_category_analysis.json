  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'HIIT' with a high confidence score of 1.0. This is due to explicit references to 'high-intensity intervals' and an intensity level of 3 out of 3, which is characteristic of High-Intensity Interval Training. The title 'Rock HIIT Row' and the description both emphasize the high-intensity nature, reinforcing its classification as a HIIT workout. \n\nThe secondary category is 'Indoor rowing', scored at 0.8. Although not explicitly mentioned, the term 'Row' in the title strongly implies the use of a rowing machine, a typical piece of equipment for such workouts. The synonymous use of 'drive' and 'standard,row' in the category metadata further supports this inference.\n\nOther categories such as 'Mat', 'Weight workout', or 'Body weight' are excluded due to the lack of evidence or direct mentions of relevant exercises or equipment. The overall analysis is confident due to the clear and repeated indications of high-intensity training and rowing-related context."
