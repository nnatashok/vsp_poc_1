  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video, titled \"Neck + Chest Opening Align,\" is designed to release tension and tightness specifically in the neck and chest, as mentioned in the description. This purpose aligns strongly with Stretching exercises, which are intended to improve flexibility and relieve muscle tightness. The mention of recommended equipment like a thick towel, blanket, or yoga block indicates optional supports often used in both Stretching and Yoga, supporting nuanced stretching and relaxation. Additionally, the activity is categorized under \"On The Mat,\" which often includes yoga and stretching sessions, indicating a lower intensity and focused bodywork session. There is not enough direct evidence of meditative or comprehensive pose-based work to classify this purely as Yoga, so it is given a lower confidence score. The playlist's chill and downtempo nature provides an environment conducive to both stretching and yoga, reinforcing relaxation. Other potential categories like Mat and Meditation are excluded due to lack of relevant explicit focus on general mat workouts or meditation mindfulness."
