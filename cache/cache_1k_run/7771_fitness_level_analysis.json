  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given that the workout category is 'row', the technique difficulty can be categorized into either Beginner or Intermediate according to Hydrow-specific rules. The inclusion of varied pace intervals might imply some coordination, hence scoring Intermediate a bit lower. Overall, the straightforward nature of rowing with breathing cues suggests a stronger alignment with Beginner level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts for over 31 minutes with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, indicating low energy expenditure. The 'breathe' type and multiple rest intervals suggest lower effort demand. While it's slightly challenging due to duration, it's predominantly a low-intensity workout, aligning mostly with 'Light'. Some intervals could push it towards 'Moderate', but not significantly enough to dominate the classification.",
