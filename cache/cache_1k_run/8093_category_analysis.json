  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Indoor Rowing' with a very high confidence due to several strong indicators from the metadata. The title 'Climbing Efforts Row' explicitly mentions 'Row', clearly suggesting a rowing-based activity. Additionally, the description references 'cruise along the shores', which aligns well with indoor rowing scenarios. The 'Format: Climb' implies an increasing intensity or challenge often associated with rowing workouts. The intensity level '2 out of 3' suggests a moderate to high challenge typical of an indoor rowing session. Moreover, terms like 'Max rhythm: 28' indicate monitoring of strokes per minute, a common metric in rowing. The choice of rhythmic, upbeat music further supports this as it complements a dynamic rowing session. Therefore, 'Indoor Rowing' is selected as the category with a score of 0.9 due to its central presence in the workout description and characteristics. Other categories like HIIT or Mat were not selected due to lack of corresponding elements such as high-intensity intervals or floor exercises."
