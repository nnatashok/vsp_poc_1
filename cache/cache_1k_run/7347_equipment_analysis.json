  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title, 'Stroke Upgrade Warm-Up,' and the description focusing on refining rowing technique imply that a rowing machine is essential. The category includes 'row,' which guarantees the need for a rowing machine at high confidence. Moreover, the activity described involves connecting parts of a stroke and finding resistance, which aligns with rower training. The image also depicts a rowing scenario, but given the usual context of training equipment, the indoor rowing machine is inferred. The confidence score is 0.95 due to explicit context and categorical alignment."
