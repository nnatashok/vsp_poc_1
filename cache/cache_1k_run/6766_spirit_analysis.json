  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Mind + Body Row' has strong elements of a Soothing & Restorative spirit. The description emphasizes leaving the session feeling better, which indicates a focus on recovery and emotional well-being. The intensity level is 1 out of 3, suggesting a gentler, more restorative workout. \n\nAdditionally, the Flow & Rhythm spirit is evident through the aerobic intervals and the playlist of indie and global hits, which likely provide a rhythmic and music-driven experience. The maximum rhythm mentioned (24) further supports a steady, flowing pace, aligning with the mind-body connection mentioned.\n\nFinally, the Outdoor & Adventure spirit is suggested by the on-water setting seen in the image, indicating a nature-based rowing experience. \n\nThe combination of a low intensity level and music that promotes rhythm, alongside the outdoor environment, highlights these three spirits as the most fitting for this workout."
