  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout is categorized under 'row' and the specific 'drive' type, technique difficulty can only be Beginner or Intermediate. The use of the format 'HIIT' and 'Drive' suggests a higher degree of technique complexity involved in maintaining proper form at a high intensity, aligning with an Intermediate level. This is supported by the presence of an advanced rhythm (max rhythm: 32) that likely requires coordination and body awareness to perform effectively.",
