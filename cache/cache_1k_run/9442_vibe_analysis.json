  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe 'The Competitor' was chosen due to the competitive nature suggested by the 'rate capped race' and 'accumulate maximum meter' elements in the description. These indicators imply a gamified, goal-oriented environment common in competitive workouts. The confidence level for this vibe is high, at 0.9, because of strong explicit language.\n\nThe secondary vibe 'The Meditative Grind' was selected based on the repetitive rowing format, which involves consistent, rhythm-based exertion over the course of 21 minutes. This aligns with endurance and focused efforts typical of a meditative grind, earning it a score of 0.7. The workout's standardized structure with an emphasis on power, combined with steady pacing (max rhythm: 18), supports this classification."
