  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is conducted on the Charles River, classifying it under the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit with high confidence (score 0.8). The environment and natural setting contribute to this categorization. The focus on breaking down the rowing stroke indicates a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, with a score of 0.7. This is supported by the technical nature of the cool down, emphasizing methodical practice of rowing technique. Furthermore, as a 'cool down' session with a low maximum rhythm of 24 strokes per minute, the routine leans towards 'Soothing & Restorative,' supporting recovery and relaxation. The use of mellow pop music also complements this calming effect, justifying a score of 0.6. The playlist suggests a mellow and relaxing atmosphere, aligning with the cool down and recovery focus."
