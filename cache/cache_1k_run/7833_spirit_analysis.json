  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Advanced HIIT Row' clearly embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit with a score of 0.9. The title itself including 'HIIT' (High-Intensity Interval Training) and the description which mentions 'maximum effort' and 'high rhythms' are strong indicators of an intense, challenging workout. The playlist features energetic pop songs, further supporting this categorization.\n\nAdditionally, the image depicts rowing on a river, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit at a score of 0.7. The natural environment enhances the adventurous aspect of the workout. While the primary focus is on intensity, the outdoor setting is integral, justifying the inclusion of this spirit.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are not suitable due to the workout's emphasis on intensity and high effort."
