  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, \"Feel the Rhythm Cool-Down,\" involves rowing at moderate rhythms with focus on precision and rhythm, hinting at a meditative quality. This aligns with \"The Meditative Grind,\" supported by the controlled pace (max rhythm 24) and practice with eyes closed, indicating a mindful and focused approach (score 0.7). \n\nThe playlist combines \"The Devil Went Down To Georgia\" and \"Tribute,\" known for engaging, story-driven music, suggesting a soothing yet engaging cooldown context. This supports elements of \"The Reboot Workout,\" focusing on a refresh and gentle movement, with a score of 0.6.\n\nThe short duration and lack of intense physical exertion exclude more vigorous vibes such as \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Nightclub Workout.\" The absence of explicit breath-centered or grounding practices excludes \"The Zen Flow.\" The confidence level is moderate at 0.7 due to limited music details and absence of instructor guidance."
