  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Solid Technique Row' emphasizes 'perfect form' and is 'technique-oriented,' which aligns well with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe. The focus on skill and form justifies a score of 0.75 under this category. Additionally, the workout is described as 'breathe' and 'standard', with a low intensity level of '1 out of 3', suggesting a steady, repetitive nature typical of 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.7. The lack of intense instruction and the use of calming music genres like Hip Hop/R&B further supports this. Lastly, the emphasis on 'breathe' and the moderate pace suggests elements of 'The Zen Flow', aligning with a slower, more intentional effort, giving it a score of 0.6. No elements suggested high intensity or adrenaline, which ruled out vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.'"
