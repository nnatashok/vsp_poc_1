  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'cool down' session lasting 10 minutes and 58 seconds, designed explicitly to lower heart rate, indicating low-intensity involvement. The Effort Difficulty is primarily Light (score: 0.9), with a slight contribution from Moderate, due to the structured nature of rowing (score: 0.1). The presence of calming activities and the lack of vigorous exercise indicate minimal energy expenditure required.",
