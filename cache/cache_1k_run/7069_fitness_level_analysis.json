  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', typically indicating simpler technique requirements. The metadata suggests 'intervals at rhythm 26', which implies a more dynamic pace but retains straightforward rowing mechanics. Therefore, technique aligns with a 'Beginner' level predominantly (score 0.75), due to the basic rowing pattern. Yet, the inclusion of 'Intermediate' is reasonable (score 0.5), due to coordination required in maintaining rhythm.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is moderate at approximately 11.5 minutes, combined with '2-minute intervals' designed to elevate heart rate, consistent with a 'sweat' type workout, which denotes some intensity. It is described as having an intensity level of '2 out of 3', indicating it requires more physical engagement than a basic workout. Hence, the effort difficulty aligns with 'Moderate' (score 0.8) and 'Challenging' (score 0.6) levels.",
