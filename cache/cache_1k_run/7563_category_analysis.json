  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as a rowing session with specific references to the 'Charles River' and using terms such as 'Power Row', which strongly indicate that this is an Indoor rowing workout. The metadata further supports this classification through mentions of a format of 'Interval' and a max rhythm of 36+, specific to rowing, and indicates a high-intensity level (3 out of 3) which aligns with powerful, interval-based rowing sessions. The music genre and playlist, while not directly indicative of a category, suggest an upbeat and energetic session matching a high-intensity rowing workout. The lack of any other equipment or exercise context further supports that the primary focus of this workout is indoor rowing, justifying the high confidence level and a score of 1. Other potential categories are excluded due to strong and explicit rowing indicators."
