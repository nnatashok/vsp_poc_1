Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of approximately 16 minutes and the description of poses mainly targeting stability with controlled movements suggest a Light effort difficulty. The absence of high-intensity cardio or weightlifting exercises and the 'chill' music playlist implies a relaxed pace. However, maintaining a proper plank for prolonged periods can introduce a Moderate effort difficulty, justifying a secondary classification at this level, albeit less strongly.",
