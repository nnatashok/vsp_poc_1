  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout \"Bring Your Best Row\" is clearly identified as an \"Indoor rowing\" session, as evidenced by the category tags 'row' and 'standard'. The description emphasizes \"one-minute efforts\" and a climbing rhythm, indicating a structured, intense workout, which aligns with \"HIIT\" principles. The intensity level rated as 3 out of 3 further supports this classification, suggesting it incorporates high-intensity elements. The workout's primary equipment appears to be a rowing machine, indicated by the 'row' tag and format references, hence the very high score for \"Indoor rowing\" at 0.9. The inclusion of climbing rhythm and intervals strengthens the classification of HIIT with a moderate score of 0.7. Other categories, such as Mat or Yoga, are excluded due to the lack of flexibility or meditation elements."
