  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Pyramid HIIT Row' is primarily characterized by a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to several key indicators. The description mentions a 'high intensity drive' and the workout type is 'drive', coupled with a format that includes 'Pyramid', indicating sessions built around intervals (work/rest cycles) intended to push physical limits. With a max rhythm of 36 and an intensity level of 3 out of 3, the session is explicitly designed to be fast-paced and highly demanding. The music genre supports this spirit, featuring rock tracks that typically accompany vigorous workouts. \n\nThe presence of rowing on a visible water body points towards an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, with the natural environment enhancing the adventurous aspect of the session. This session was conducted on water, aligning with the spirit of exploration and environmental engagement. \n\nOverall, the workout's intense focus makes 'High-Energy & Intense' the prominent spirit, while the nature of the activity supports an 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification as a secondary aspect."
