  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout 'Standing Dynamic Mobility' clearly suggests that this is an activity focused on improving mobility, which is often done through basic body movements often performed on a mat. The description mentions 'without going on your knees or back,' indicating upright exercises that do not require complex equipment or floor work, aligning well with the 'Mat' category. There is a notable focus on warming up and dynamic movements, which are essential features of mobility workouts, suggesting a 'Mat' classification with a high score of 0.8.\n\nThe second category, 'Stretching,' is suggested due to the low-impact nature of mobility work, commonly encompassing stretching exercises to enhance flexibility and prepare the body for more intensive workouts. Given the context, it receives a moderate score of 0.6.\n\n'Body weight' is chosen as the third category since this workout does not mention any equipment and involves standing movements, likely making use of body resistance. However, the term 'mobility' doesn't explicitly suggest strength or resistance training, resulting in a lower score of 0.4.\n\nOther categories like 'Weight workout' or 'HIIT' have been excluded due to the lack of equipment or high intensity, as inferred from the calm nature of the playlist and the 'warm-up' description."
