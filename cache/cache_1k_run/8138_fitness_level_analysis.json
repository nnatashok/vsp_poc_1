  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically aligns with Beginner to Intermediate technique difficulty as per guidelines. The interval format introduces a slight increase in complexity due to required coordination in varying stroke rates. However, rowing generally remains straightforward in form mechanics for less complex classifications, leading to a primary Beginner level with some Intermediate aspects due to intervals.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration exceeds 30 minutes with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, suggesting a moderate to high energy expenditure, fitting 'Moderate' and 'Challenging' classifications. The use of intervals at a max rhythm of 28 further increases physical demands, especially since sessions require adjusting effort over time. Classification is balanced between Moderate and Challenging given the moderate intensity cue, designed for broader user engagement at different effort levels.",
