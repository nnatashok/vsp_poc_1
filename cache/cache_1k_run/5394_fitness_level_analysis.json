  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is only 5 minutes and 44 seconds long, which strongly suggests a low energy expenditure suited for a Light effort difficulty classification.

Without any specified intensity cues or equipment to increase effort, this session is most suitable for users requiring minimal physical exertion.",
