  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout name 'Running Up the Hill Row' and the description clearly indicate a rowing-themed workout involving HIIT intervals. The metadata further categorizes the workout under 'row', which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the image shows a person rowing, reinforcing the likelihood that a rowing machine is necessary for this workout. Despite the lack of explicit mention in the equipment section, the combination of the title, category, and image provides very high confidence (0.9) that a rowing machine is central to this workout."
