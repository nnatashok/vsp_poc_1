Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the 15:53 duration and the focus on breathing, the workout seems designed to be calming rather than physically taxing, aligning strongly with 'Light' effort difficulty at 0.9 and 'Moderate' at 0.3. The chill and downtempo music also reinforce a lower intensity experience, suitable for a light workout level, with some possibilities for moderate due to consistent movement in the flow.",
