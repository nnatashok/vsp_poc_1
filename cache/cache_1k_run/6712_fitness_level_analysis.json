  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of approximately 11 minutes and focus on core strength suggests moderate effort, especially since pilates demands maintaining tension in the core. Lack of high-intensity cues or rapid pacing aligns more with moderate intensity. The music selection, which is not specifically high-tempo, further implies a calm, steady pace likely to offer a moderate level of physical demand, accessible to less fit users.",
