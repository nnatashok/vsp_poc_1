  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing-based session, indicating a ceiling of 'Intermediate' for Technique Difficulty due to the inherent straightforwardness of the movements associated with rowing. The description emphasizes 'practicing pacing' during intervals, which might introduce some complexity in finding and maintaining rhythm, leading to a higher Beginner score or a lower Intermediate score. Given the lack of more complex elements, both Beginner and Intermediate levels are applicable.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's effort difficulty is primarily Moderate, supported by the 21-minute duration and the '2' out of 3 intensity level. The inclusion of 2' and 3' intervals suggests that users will exert more energy than a sedentary activity, aligning with Moderate level. However, the requirement to maintain a rhythm at 26 strokes could increase the perceived effort, leading to a secondary Challenging alignment.",
