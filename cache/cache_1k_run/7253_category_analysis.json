  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Yoga' with a high score of 0.8, based on the explicit title 'Hero Pose Restorative Yoga' and the description that mentions starting in a 'hero's pose' and 'lifting your heart up.' These elements indicate a focus on yoga postures and breathing, typical of a yoga workout. Additional support comes from the use of 'restorative,' which is a specific type of yoga aimed at relaxation and posture improvement. The secondary category is 'Stretching' with a score of 0.6. The description highlights 'opening your chest and improving posture,' activities closely linked to stretching exercises. The workout's placement on 'the mat' without external resistance or high intensity, combined with chill music, further corroborates these categories. As such, neither a high-intensity nor a bodyweight-focused workout is inferred, which excludes other possible categories."
