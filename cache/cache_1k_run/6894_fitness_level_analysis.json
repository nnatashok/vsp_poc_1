  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is listed as 'drive', which Hydrow's classification categorizes as Advanced for rowing workouts. However, the user's fitness level specified as Advanced suggests substantial coordination and skill. Sprint intervals demand good technique to maintain form, but given the limitation of the category 'row', Intermediate is the highest appropriate classification tied to rowing technique difficulty here. The confidence is high due to the specific workout type (drive).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is over 21 minutes, with a high-intensity level of 3 out of 3. It includes sprint intervals, suggesting high energy expenditure and effort. The interval format typically allows less rest, maintaining a consistently elevated intensity level. Given these factors, it's strongly aligned with both Challenging and Extreme effort difficulty classifications, with a higher score for Challenging considering the user's likely reference frame of 'Advanced'.",
