  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Instructional: Power at Low Rhythms' focuses on generating power at lower rhythms and is categorized as a warm-up, indicating a steady pacing suitable for 'The Meditative Grind.' The music selection with tracks from Kygo, Miguel, and Vigiland, plus the 'Dance mid, Global Hits' radio stations, adds a layer of beat-driven motivation aligning with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe. The 5-minute 50-second duration supports a focus on power and rhythm, fitting these vibes. The instructional aspect suggests a controlled, focused experience, commonly associated with 'The Meditative Grind.' While the vibe isn't unleashing intense energy like 'The Warrior Workout,' it does provide a structured rhythm-focused experience. Hence, both vibes are relevant with moderate to high confidence."
