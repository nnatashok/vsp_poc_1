  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Power Strokes Warm-Up' features a series of 10-power strokes, which suggests a repetitive motion fitting the 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, characterized by zoning in and letting repetition take over. This is reinforced by the rowing element and the interval format, indicative of sustained rhythm and engagement, scoring a 0.7 for its strong alignment.\n\nThe inclusion of dance and global hits music implies an energetic and feel-good atmosphere, aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, which emphasizes elevated energy and enjoyable movement. The short duration and warm-up designation set the intensity at a lighter but still energizing level, thus earning a 0.6 score for its strong match.\n\nOverall, the metadata suggests a preparatory workout with a combination of rhythm, repetition, and upbeat music, making these two vibes the most representative."
