Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of about 31 minutes with a circuit format suggests consistent activity and rest intervals, which enhances the effort level. The addition of '3-minute intervals on Hydrow' in the session would likely increase heart rate, making the workout moderately demanding, especially for deconditioned users. Hence, it strongly aligns with a moderate difficulty and partially aligns with challenging for those less physically conditioned.",
