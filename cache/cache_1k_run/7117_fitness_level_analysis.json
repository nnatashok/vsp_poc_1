  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'drive,' which aligns with advanced technique requirements specific to Hydrow's classification. This suggests a higher complexity due to the need for proper rowing form at high intensities. However, since it is still a rowing workout, the Technique Difficulty may predominantly be Intermediate, reflecting the moderately complex movement typical of rowing workouts.",
