  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short at just under 16 minutes, and the music is described as 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo,' suggesting a low-intensity, relaxing session. As a beginner yoga class, it likely involves gentle stretching and breathing exercises, which contribute to a light effort requirement. However, yoga can involve some sustained poses that may slightly elevate the intensity, leading to a secondary alignment with moderate effort difficulty.",
