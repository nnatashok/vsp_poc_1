  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is clearly specified as an 'Endurance Climb Row,' which directly indicates that it is an indoor rowing session. The description mentions '4-minute intervals' with a 'shift up in rhythm each minute,' which corresponds to a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format. The term 'sweat' in the workout type and the categorization under 'sweat, standard, row' further solidifies that this is a cardio-intensive workout centered on rowing. The workout is designed to be rhythmic and challenging, suggested by 'max rhythm: 30,' aligning with the intensity level of '2 out of 3.' Due to these factors, 'Indoor rowing' is rated with high confidence (score: 0.9), as it is a central element, and 'HIIT' is rated slightly lower (score: 0.7) since while the structure fits HIIT, rowing is more explicitly emphasized. Other categories are excluded due to a lack of relevant indicators."
