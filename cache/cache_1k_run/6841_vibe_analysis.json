  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is characterized by a steady rhythm and calming cool-down, which aligns well with 'The Zen Flow'. The use of terms like 'slow', 'steady', and 'cool-down' suggest a grounding and intentional approach, earning it a score of 0.8 for this vibe. The moderate rhythm and repetitive rowing fit 'The Meditative Grind', which is supported by the focus on steady movement, hence a score of 0.6. Furthermore, the mention of a cool-down and the use of relaxed music like 'Mr. Jones' and 'Badfish' supports 'The Reboot Workout', indicating a refreshing total-body reset, leading to a score of 0.5. The use of pop and global hits adds an accessible, feel-good layer although not highly impactful for classification. Other vibes were excluded due to a lack of intense or competitive elements in the workout description."
