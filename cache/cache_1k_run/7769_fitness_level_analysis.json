Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a cool down, lasting under 6 minutes, designed to gently end a workout session rather than exert high energy. Cool downs are inherently low intensity and require minimal effort, suitable for sustaining or returning heart rate to resting levels. This aligns strongly with the Light effort difficulty as there is minimal energy expenditure expected, supporting a very low intensity exercise experience.",
