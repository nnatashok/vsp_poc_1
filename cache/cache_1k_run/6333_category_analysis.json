  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Post-Row Align Yoga.\" The explicit mention of \"Yoga\" in the title and description strongly indicates the inclusion of yoga practice, justifying a high confidence (0.9) and a score of 0.9 for the Yoga category. The description emphasizes moving through the hips, hamstrings, and spine, which are common focus areas in yoga practices, particularly those designed to follow physical activities such as rowing. This also suggests a mild presence of stretching elements, leading to a moderate score (0.5) for Stretching. The description, \"align yoga designed for right after a row,\" further supports this by indicating a recovery or alignment purpose. The use of calm and downtempo music complements the relaxed, aligning nature of yoga and stretching activities. The categories \"Mat\" were excluded as the emphasis is more clearly on yoga, as supported by metadata. Other categories such as Indoor rowing and Pilates were excluded due to lack of evidence."
