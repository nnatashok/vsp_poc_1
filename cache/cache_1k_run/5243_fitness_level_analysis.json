  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is only 5 minutes and 45 seconds, indicating a short session with limited scope to build substantial exertion levels. The focus is on 'core burn,' which can imply some intensity; however, the quick session and absence of equipment suggest low-to-moderate energy expenditure. The upbeat music may encourage some rhythm and pace, slightly lifting the effort difficulty to include Moderate but predominantly Light.",
