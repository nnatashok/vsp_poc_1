  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'Drive' type, which Hydrow specifies as having an advanced technique difficulty. However, because the category also includes 'standard' and 'row', and the primary movement is rowing, the technique difficulty remains capped at 'Intermediate' per Hydrow's guidelines. The intervals format, while requiring some coordination, generally aligns with intermediate rowing ability.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a high intensity level of 3 out of 3, coupled with a relatively prolonged duration of over 31 minutes. The use of intervals with max rhythm 30 suggests a high frequency of intense effort. This aligns well with both 'Challenging' and 'Extreme' effort difficulty levels for users with lower fitness, indicating significant energy expenditure and physical demand.",
