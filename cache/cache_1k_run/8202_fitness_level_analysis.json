  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Unleashed Row' workout is primarily categorized under 'row' with a type 'Drive,' which typically indicates a more technically demanding rowing workout. However, due to the Hydrow-specific rule, the maximum Technique Difficulty for rowing workouts can only be Intermediate. Although the workshop is guided by a Paralympian known for expert technical instruction, the constraints on rowing categories prevent it from reaching Advanced or Expert levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves four 5-minute intervals within a 31-minute duration, focusing on a max rhythm of 30 and intense effort, as reflected by the 3 out of 3 intensity rating. The energetic nature of the music playlist and the description of the instructor's high-energy delivery support a classification between Challenging to Extreme. However, a lower confidence in it being Extreme is due to the interval format, which implies rests in between high effort bouts, fitting more snugly into 'Challenging.'",
