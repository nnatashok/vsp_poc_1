  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short (10:49 minutes), and the focus is on stretching, indicating a light intensity typical in such sessions. The accompanying music and inclusion of slower-paced, downtempo songs further imply a relaxed atmosphere. However, for someone less fit, the yoga element may introduce moderate effort. Therefore, the effort difficulty is predominantly Light with aspects of Moderate difficulty for less conditioned individuals.",
