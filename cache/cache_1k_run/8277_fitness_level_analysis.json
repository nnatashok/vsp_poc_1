  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session duration is slightly over 10 minutes and consists of yoga stretches, which are typically low intensity. The music genre is soothing (chill low, cool/downtempo), further indicating a low-energy session. This aligns with a Light effort difficulty since yoga can be relaxing and restorative, requiring minimal physical exertion, especially in a short session. There's a minimal alignment with Moderate due to the focus on stretching of potentially tight muscles, but the primary effort level remains Light.",
