  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which typically involves basic rowing movements. Such movements are generally accessible and require minimal coordination, aligning it with a Beginner technique difficulty. Considering the Interval format and a maximum rhythm of 28, which may demand slightly more rhythm awareness and pacing, an additional Intermediate score is applied at a lower confidence.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of 16 minutes and is structured as interval training, which increases physical demand. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggests it is designed to offer some cardiovascular challenge, making it moderately demanding. Given the rhythm cap and lack of rest detail, it leans towards Moderate, though the Interval format could suggest some Challenging aspects, hence the lower score for Challenging.",
