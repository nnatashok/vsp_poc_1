  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', which limits the Technique Difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate as per Hydrow guidelines. The pyramid structure involves incrementally increasing rhythms, possibly requiring a moderate level of technique to maintain form. However, since the User Fitness Level Requirement is Beginner, and the description emphasizes focusing on technique without advanced complexity, a Beginner rating with a slight consideration for Intermediate is given.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts over 31 minutes with varied intervals, which suggests a moderate effort difficulty, especially given the 'breathe' type. The workout intensity is marked as 1 out of 3, indicating a lower energy requirement fitting a 'Moderate' classification. Nonetheless, the pyramid scheme of increasing rhythm implies some challenge for beginners, so a 'Challenging' level is also considered, though to a lesser extent.",
