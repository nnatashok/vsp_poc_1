  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'row' inherently lends itself to Beginner or Intermediate levels of technique difficulty due to relatively simple rowing motion. The lack of specific coordination challenges or complex movements in the description suggests a strong alignment with Beginner difficulty (score: 1). However, a small component of differentiating rhythm ('Format: Climb' with a max rhythm of 24) points to Intermediate (score: 0.6).",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 31 minutes and a low intensity level (1 out of 3) suggest Moderate effort difficulty (score: 0.8), due to the extended activity period which requires sustained moderate effort. The 'Breathe' type indicates a focus on paced exhalation, aligning with Moderate as well. Some Light effort (score: 0.4) is suggested by the instructional theme and rowing nature.",
