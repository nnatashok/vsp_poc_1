  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to the format specified as 'HIIT' (High-Intensity Interval Training) and the description emphasizing 'max pressure' and a rhythm of '30' during 1-minute intervals. This suggests an emphasis on pushing physical limits and intensity, justifying a high score of 0.9.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also applicable due to the structured nature of maintaining a specific rhythm ('rhythm 30'), and the pop and global hits playlist supports a music-driven pacing, contributing to a score of 0.7.\n\nThe image indicates an outdoor rowing setting, which aligns partially with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, warranting a score of 0.5 due to the environmental elements and connection to nature, even though intensity and rhythm are the main focuses. The workout is not primarily structured for technique, recovery, or sports-specific skills, thus excluding other spirits."
