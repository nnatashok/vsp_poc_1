  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically simplifies technique difficulty due to the repetitive nature of rowing strokes. The description underscores simplicity by focusing on the 'feeling the movement', suggesting an emphasis on basic elements rather than complex patterns. Additionally, the technical prowess of the instructor and the inclusion of 'in-depth technical detail' might suggest a slight complexity, allowing for a minimal Intermediate classification. However, the Beginner requirement strongly dominates, aligning more with the listed fitness level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of just over 16 minutes is relatively short, suggesting a lighter effort difficulty, despite the 'Interval' format which could imply more intensity. The intensity level is rated at 1 out of 3, indicating it's not particularly demanding. The inclusion of upbeat pop music implies a lighter tempo conducive to sustained effort without high exertion. Therefore, this workout is primarily suited for those seeking light physical activity while potentially introducing a touch of moderate exertion due to the interval aspect.",
