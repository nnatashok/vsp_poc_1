  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts just over 11 minutes, which limits the physical demand significantly. The focus on feet and ankles in a yoga session, along with a chill music playlist, suggests a relaxing, low-intensity session. While it involves some muscle engagement, the effort is likely low and suitable for light exertion, slightly extending into moderate for some users.",
