  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The Technique Difficulty is classified based on the metadata indicating a 'row' session, which prioritizes beginner to intermediate levels as specified by the Hydrow guidelines. The workout involves a 20-minute main session at 'sweat intensity,' but does not seem to involve highly complex movements, aligning it with coordinated, yet accessible, rowing techniques suitable for beginner to intermediate users.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The Effort Difficulty is inferred primarily from the 31-minute duration with a central 'sweat' session lasting 20 minutes marked 'intensity level 2 out of 3.' This suggests moderately high energy expenditure for the duration, classifying it between Moderate and Challenging. The interval format can increase overall intensity slightly, but is still quite manageable.",
