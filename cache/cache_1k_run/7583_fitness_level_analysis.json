Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is under 6 minutes, which falls on the lower end of exercise sessions, and it is described as a 'cool down', inherently indicating a low physical demand. The cool down involves 'marginal gains' and is performed at a maximum rhythm of 24, which further supports very low energy expenditure and physical demand. These factors point to a 'Light' effort difficulty.",
