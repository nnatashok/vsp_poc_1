  "vibesExplanation": "The chosen vibes are based on several key aspects of the workout metadata. \"The Firestarter\" vibe is strongly evident with a score of 0.9 due to the fast-paced, 15-second bursts described in the workout, aligning with HIIT characteristics. Rock and Global Hits music further amplify the intensity. \"The Warrior Workout\" is assigned a score of 0.75 since the workout demands maximum effort and high intensity, as indicated by the '3 out of 3' intensity level, signifying a primal, intense energy. \"The Competitor\" vibe is present but less dominant, with a score of 0.6, as the workout is gamified with the challenge of keeping pace during intense intervals. No leaderboard or explicit competitive elements reduce its prominence compared to the other vibes."
