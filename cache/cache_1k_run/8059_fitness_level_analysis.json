  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which typically falls under Beginner or Intermediate Technique Difficulty levels according to Hydrow-specific guidelines. The description emphasizes a focus on slowing down and creating space, suggesting a more mindful, less complex movement pattern. Furthermore, the workout intensity is relatively low, marked at 1 out of 3, which reinforces the likelihood of simple rowing movements. Given these factors, the Technique Difficulty is predominantly Beginner due to the straightforward nature of rowing, with a slight possibility of Intermediate complexity due to the interval format, though this is minimal.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 21 minutes and categorized with a low intensity of 1 out of 3, which indicates that it is likely not highly demanding, suitable for those new to regular exercise. The focus on 'breathe' and 'creating space' implies a low-energy, mindful session designed more for relaxation or gentle cardio, suggesting a Light Effort Difficulty. The inclusion of interval format raises a possibility of Moderate effort due to the potential introduction of varied rhythmic challenges, but this is less emphasized, leading to a primarily Light classification.",
