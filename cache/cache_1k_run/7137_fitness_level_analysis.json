  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout category 'row', suggests a generally lower technique difficulty, limited to Beginner or Intermediate. With the title 'Learn and Burn Row' and no complex movements indicated within the metadata or description, there is a strong alignment with Beginner (score 0.7) and moderate with Intermediate (score 0.4). This fits the description of simple rowing movements and a formula-focused narrative, indicating minimal coordination challenges.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 21 minutes aligns with Moderate to Challenging effort difficulty. The workout type 'sweat' with a format of 'Interval' and max rhythm of 30 suggest intervals that elevate energy expenditure. The intensity level is noted as 2 out of 3, which signifies a higher degree of effort than basic workouts. Hence, while it appears more fitting for those able to manage moderate efforts, the Challenging score reflects the potential intensity posed by the intervals involved.",
