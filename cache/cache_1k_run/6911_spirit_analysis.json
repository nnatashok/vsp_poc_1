  "spiritsExplanation": "The video \"Post-Row Pilates\" is classified under multiple spirits:\n\n1. **Flow & Rhythm (0.7):** The workout involves pilates, suggesting smooth and controlled movements, aligning with the spirit of Flow & Rhythm. The background music from dance and global hits may further support a rhythmic, music-driven pace.\n\n2. **Soothing & Restorative (0.6):** As a post-row activity focusing on specific muscle groups for recovery (glutes and hamstrings), this workout has elements of relaxation and stress reduction, fitting the Soothing & Restorative spirit.\n\n3. **Outdoor & Adventure (0.8):** The image shows the workout being conducted outdoors by the water, confirming the Outdoor & Adventure classification. The natural setting enhances the experience of engaging with the environment.\n\nThe workout is too gentle for High-Energy & Intense, lacks structured progression for Structured & Disciplined, and doesn\u2019t focus on sports skills, excluding Sport & Agility. The spirits chosen are supported by the activity type, setting, and music."
