  "categoriesConfidence": 0.9,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as a 'Post-Row Stretch' focusing on stretching hips and glutes after rowing, which clearly indicates a 'Stretching' category. The inclusion of a recommendation for yoga blocks suggests some overlap with Yoga, as such equipment is often used in yoga practice, but not exclusively. The description explicitly identifies the workout type as stretching, justifying a strong score of 0.9 for 'Stretching'. 'Yoga' has some relevance due to equipment mention but lacks specific yoga movements or poses, warranting only a mild consideration with a score of 0.3. Other categories like Mat were considered but 'Stretching' and 'Yoga' were more directly supported by the description and equipment."
