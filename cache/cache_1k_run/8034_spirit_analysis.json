  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is identified as a 'cool down,' which aligns strongly with a Soothing & Restorative spirit, especially as it emphasizes patience and lower rhythm rowing, typical of recovery-focused sessions, justifying a high score of 0.9. The mention of rowing in Bergen paired with the outdoor image suggests an Outdoor & Adventure element, supporting this classification with a score of 0.7. Though the session prioritizes lower rhythms, suggesting some alignment with Flow & Rhythm, the emphasis is more on relaxation and recovery than fluidity or musical pacing, resulting in a moderate score of 0.5. The environment and the calming nature of a cool-down session were the primary considerations for these spirits."
