  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' which means the technique difficulty is restricted to at most 'Intermediate'. The description suggests a focus on proper form without mentioning complex or advanced movements, which aligns well with a 'Beginner' level technique. The interval format might introduce an element of challenge, hence there is a partial fit for 'Intermediate'.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 16 minutes and the assigned intensity level of 1 out of 3 suggest the effort level is primarily 'Light'. A 'breathe' workout type typically signals a lower intensity suitable for recovery or endurance building. The inclusion of intervals introduces some variation in effort, suggesting some alignment with 'Moderate' effort difficulty.",
