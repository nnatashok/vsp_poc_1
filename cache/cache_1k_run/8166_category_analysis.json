  "categoriesExplanation": "The category 'Yoga' was assigned a high score of 0.9 due to explicit keywords such as \"standing postures,\" \"yoga blocks,\" and the workout name itself, \"Heat Building + Standing Postures,\" strongly indicating a yoga practice focused on building heat and incorporating standing postures. The use of yoga blocks further reinforces this categorization. The music mentioned is chill, matching typical yoga practice tones. 'Mat' was also considered with a score of 0.6 due to the tag 'On The Mat,' indicating that the workout involves floor-based activities or exercises commonly associated with mat work. The 'align' workout type suggests a focus on body alignment, which is integral to yoga practice. There is strong confidence in the assignment, with the majority of the metadata pointing towards a Yoga practice."
