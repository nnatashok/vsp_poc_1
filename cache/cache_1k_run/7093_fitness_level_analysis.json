  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' in the Hydrow platform is typically associated with higher difficulty levels due to its focus on powerful, technical rowing strokes and intense pacing, aligned with the 'Interval' format requiring coordination and rhythm. Despite this, the primary action being rowing keeps it within Intermediate due to Hydrow rules, though advanced aspects may be present given the instructor's Olympic background.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity level is marked as 3 out of 3, indicating it is very demanding. The interval format and high rhythm (max rhythm of 32) further suggest sustained, high-energy output, requiring significant physical exertion over the 21-minute duration. This places it primarily in the Challenging category but with elements of Extreme due to the overall structure and reported intensity.",
