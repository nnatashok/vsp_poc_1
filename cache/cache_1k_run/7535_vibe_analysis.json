  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Split Control Row' focuses on gradually controlling power output, which is indicative of 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The mention of a steady pace with a gradual increase indicates a repetitive, endurance-focused session. The score of 0.75 reflects the moderate intensity level of the workout.\n\nAdditionally, the use of pop and global hits music, such as 'Love Explosion' and 'Semi-Charmed Life,' suggests an enjoyable and uplifting atmosphere. This aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, characterized by a feel-good movement that builds energy over time, which feels suitable for the gradually increasing pace of the workout. The score here is 0.65 due to the emotional upliftment provided by the music.\n\nThe workout does not strongly align with high-intensity or explosive vibes, like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter,' given the moderate intensity and control-focused approach, hence those were excluded."
