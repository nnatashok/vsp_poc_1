  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'row' under the Drive category, which Hydrow specifies as having at most an Intermediate technique difficulty. Despite being part of the Drive format, which typically indicates an advanced-level workout, the 'row' category constrains the difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. The use of the term 'HIIT' suggests some complexity, hence the strong assignment to Intermediate with room for Beginner alignment for those familiar with basic rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 21 minutes with a format of HIIT and a high max rhythm of 32, which suggests a high intensity. The intensity level is 3 out of 3, indicating that it is quite demanding. The focus on 1-minute intervals typical in HIIT formats also suggests brief but very intense efforts. Given these factors, the workout is firmly Challenging, with strong indications towards Extreme difficulty for deconditioned users due to the sustained high intensity.",
