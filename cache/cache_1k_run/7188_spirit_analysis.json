  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Fix Your Posture' is designed to improve posture through mobility exercises targeted at the neck, shoulders, and upper back. The nature of these exercises suggests a focus on gentle, controlled movements conducive to 'Soothing & Restorative' practices. This spirit is strongly indicated by the emphasis on posture improvement, which implies care and relaxation (score: 0.8).\n\nAdditionally, the playlist includes songs from a variety of genres such as Country and Global Hits, which can create a supportive flow, aligning with 'Flow & Rhythm.' The music's rhythm may aid in movement synchronization but holds a secondary emphasis behind the primary restorative goal (score: 0.6).\n\nThere is minimal intensity and no sports-specific or adventurous elements, leading to the exclusion of those spirits. The structured nature of posture improvement could suggest some 'Structured & Disciplined' elements, but the overall restorative intention is more prevalent."
