  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Warrior Workout' (score 0.8) because of its focus on an upper body and core circuit with a combination of dumbbells and rowing, signifying a sweat-dripping and primal energy experience. The use of dumbbells, EMOM format, and explicit lyrics further emphasize an intense and determined vibe. \n\nThe 'Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe is also relevant (score 0.7) due to the energetic Latin and Global Hits music, which underscores a beat-driven workout that remains fluid and strong. This is amplified by the mention of specific songs that are rhythmically intense.\n\n'Adrenaline Rush' (score 0.6) captures the heart-racing, full-body intensity aspect, suggested by the max rhythm and short, explosive duration of the workout. The circuit nature and quick transitions contribute to a challenge that keeps participants on their toes. These cross-references help eliminate ambiguity and solidify the classification."
