  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as both 'HIIT' and 'Indoor rowing' based on several strong indicators in the metadata. The title 'Power HIIT Row' explicitly mentions 'HIIT', and this classification is reinforced by the description referring to 'short intervals at your sprint and max pace', marking it as high-intensity interval training. The phrase 'explore Miami' is metaphorical here, likely indicating the high-energy nature and visual theme of the workout. The term 'max rhythm: 32' suggests a rowing pace, reinforcing the 'Indoor rowing' classification. The workout's format is described as 'HIIT', and the intensity level is listed as '3 out of 3', both of which align well with this categorization. Despite the inclusion of 'standard,row' in the category tags, the primary intensity focus is on HIIT within a rowing context, which justifies the categorization but with slightly lower emphasis on 'Indoor rowing' since it's a specific application within the high-intensity context rather than a relaxed rowing session. Overall, the energetic playlist featuring dance remixes also supports the high-energy HIIT classification."
