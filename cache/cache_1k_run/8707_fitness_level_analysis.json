  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session lasts 5 minutes and 42 seconds, indicating a short, likely low-intensity workout. Pilates, especially in a core-focused context without high cardio activity, tends to have a Light effort difficulty, suitable for those gradually building fitness. Though core exercises can slightly increase intensity, the session's short duration supports a predominant Light classification with some scope for Moderate engagement due to involved muscle work.",
