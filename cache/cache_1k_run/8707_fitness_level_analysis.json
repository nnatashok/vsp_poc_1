  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is only 5 minutes long, significantly limiting the potential for high energy expenditure. Pilates, especially in such short, focused sessions, predominantly engages muscles through low-intensity work. No equipment or high-intensity cues are mentioned, aligning with light effort. This matches well with the 'Light' category, which is suitable for core fitness with minimal physical stress.",
