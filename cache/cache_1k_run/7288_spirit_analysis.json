  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title 'Recover + Return Cool-Down' and description emphasize recovery and relaxation, indicative of a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The mention of 'cool down' and 'recover' are clear indicators of a session designed for rest and healing, deserving a score of 0.9.\n\nThe image shows rowing on a river, which fits the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit as the participants are engaging with a natural outdoor setting. This aspect of the workout is consistently aligned with environmental interaction, warranting a score of 0.8.\n\nThe moderate rhythm and steady format further support the focus on calming, rhythmic movement typically associated with a cool-down, rather than intense effort or structured training, excluding spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined.' There is no indication of sport-specific skills practiced, excluding 'Sport & Agility.'\n\nThe music genre being unspecified but playing Country and Global Hits suggests a relaxed and potentially varied musical backdrop, though this does not heavily influence the spirit classification in this case."
