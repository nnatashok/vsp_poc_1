  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled 'Joyful Intention Row' strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine. The inclusion of the term 'row' in both the workout name and category ('row') indicates rowing as the central activity, suggesting the requirement of a rowing machine. The workout format as a 'Pyramid' and described activity of climbing up and down at a jog pace are consistent with structured rowing workouts, further supporting this classification. Additionally, the provided image shows an individual rowing, reinforcing the need for a rowing machine. Therefore, there is very high confidence that a rowing machine is the necessary equipment for this workout."
