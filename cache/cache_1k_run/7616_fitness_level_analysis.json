  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is primarily Beginner due to the workout type being 'row', which aligns with Hydrow's rules that limit rowing-based workouts to Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty. The focus on technique every 10 minutes implies some degree of coordination, suggesting a slight Intermediate influence. However, based on the metadata, the Beginner score is higher owing to the overall nature of rowing and the specified User Fitness Level Requirement, which is Beginner.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as Light primarily because the workout is categorized as 'breathe' with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, indicating low physical demand. The interval format might suggest a potential for increased intensity, but given the overall characterization as a 'breathe' session with music genres like Blues/Jazz which suit a slower pace, the Light rating is justified.",
