  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is part of Hydrow's 'Drive' category, which automatically assigns an Advanced technique difficulty due to the complex, rhythm-based rowing involved. This requires substantial body coordination and rowing proficiency, supported by metadata context such as the high rhythm number (Max rhythm: 34) indicating advanced rowing technique. Therefore, it fits the Advanced category with high confidence.",

The use of high-energy rock music further suggests a demanding session intended to maintain high energy output. Therefore, the demanding nature aligned with 'Drive' workouts and high intensity level validate this classification.",
