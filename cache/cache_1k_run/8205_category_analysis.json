  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as 'Stretching' due to the explicit focus on 'hip mobility' and 'mobility exercises' as stated in the workout name and description. These exercises are typically aimed at improving flexibility and range of motion, which are key elements of stretching routines. With a duration of 10 minutes and 39 seconds, this session is likely designed to target specific areas with a low-intensity, focused approach. This aligns strongly with the characteristics of Stretching, thus earning a high score of 0.8.\n\nThe presence of 'On The Mat' as a category and 'mobility' exercises implies that the workout is performed on the ground using only body movements, without any equipment, which indicates a 'Mat' workout. This earns a secondary classification as 'Mat' with a score of 0.7, as some stretching exercises can also overlap with general mat exercises.\n\nOther categories such as Yoga or Pilates are excluded because there is no mention of yoga postures or Pilates techniques. High-intensity categories like HIIT or Running are irrelevant based on the workout's description and intent."
