  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This workout involves rowing, indicated by its 'row' category and driving focus in the 'drive' type. The rowing activity can range from beginner to intermediate in terms of technique, as it emphasizes proper form and rhythm. However, integrating HIIT elements and a 3 out of 3 intensity level suggests a more complex execution likely needing intermediate skill to manage pacing and electricity. There's a slight tilt towards advanced due to the 'drive' component, known for demanding power and control, raising it above basic rowing complexity. Thus, it is mainly intermediate, with a nod towards advanced techniques due to these factors.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is driven by the 21-minute duration, intense HIIT structure, and high-intensity music. With rapid intervals escalating in duration, participants face increased cardiovascular and muscular demands. The 'drive' workout type, paired with a stated intensity of 3 out of 3, supports that this session likely pushes into the challenging or extreme brackets, particularly for less conditioned users. The continuous cycling through energetic phases underscores a significant physical exertion level typical of challenging efforts, with elements approaching extreme exertion due to consistent high-intensity cues and minimal rest likely present in HIIT formats.",
