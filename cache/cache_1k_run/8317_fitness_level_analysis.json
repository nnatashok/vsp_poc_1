  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features a 'Drive' format, specifically a HIIT row, which typically requires an intermediate level of coordination given the faster pace and rhythm changes indicated by a max rhythm of 32. Although rowing generally may be beginner or intermediate, the combination with HIIT and being categorized as 'Drive' increases complexity. Additional complexities such as pacing, transitioning between intervals, and potentially explosive rowing strokes align more with 'Intermediate.'",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of over 21 minutes with a focus on 'HIIT' indicates high energy expenditure, compounded by a maximum intensity level of 3 out of 3. This suggests a demanding workout with limited rest, typical of high-intensity interval training, which aligns closely with 'Challenging' difficulty. The fast-paced music genre further supports this level of energetic demand, reinforcing it as more than just moderate effort.",
