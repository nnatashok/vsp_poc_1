  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing-based routine, which places it in the 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate' category based on Hydrow's specific rules. The workout name and description suggest that it's part of a 'sweat' category with an interval format, indicating some level of coordination in rhythm, but not complex beyond basic rowing. Therefore, both Beginner (0.8) and Intermediate (0.6) apply, with a slant towards Beginner.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 11 minutes and 22 seconds, using a max rhythm of 26 with a format of interval, which suggests short bursts of increased effort. The intensity level is 2 out of 3, indicating moderate to somewhat challenging physical demand. Therefore, 'Moderate' (0.7) captures the primary effort requirement, while 'Challenging' (0.5) is also relevant due to the interval structure and pacing.",
