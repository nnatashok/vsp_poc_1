The description suggests a focus on rowing with high-energy intervals, which requires some coordination but does not involve complex movements often seen in weights or non-row workouts.

The max rhythm of 26 and 'sweat' workout type indicate moderate to challenging effort for less fit users. The time and intensity align more with a Moderate to Challenging level, due to the short bursts of high energy.",
