  "categoriesExplanation": "The metadata describes a 'Travel Mobility' workout aimed at mobilizing the body after travel. The term 'mobility' and 'Mobilize your body' strongly suggest a focus on flexibility and range of motion, fitting well within the 'Stretching' category. Additionally, the description labels the category as 'On The Mat' and 'standard', which indicates exercises that do not require equipment and are likely floor-based, hence complementing the 'Mat' category. The lack of high-intensity or equipment-specific indicators reinforces that these are likely gentle exercises focusing on flexibility rather than strength or endurance. The title, description, and classification as a standard mat workout provide clear indicators for these categories with high confidence."
