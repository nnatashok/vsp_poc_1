  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "A 15-minute yoga flow is relatively short, suggesting light physical demand. Yoga typically emphasizes controlled movements and breathing, aligning with the 'Chill mid' and 'Cool/Downtempo' music, which further supports a relaxed intensity. However, the phrase 'build heat throughout your body' implies some moderate effort is possible. Hence, Light (score 0.8) is most fitting, with some potential for Moderate effort (score 0.5).",
