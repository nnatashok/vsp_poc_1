  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'flow', specifically a yoga flow, implying a range of movements from simple to slightly complex. The description suggests it is suitable for all levels, indicating both beginner-friendly poses and slightly more challenging intermediate sequences. The lack of specific equipment and short duration align with low complexity. Thus, there is a very strong alignment with Beginner and a moderate alignment with Intermediate technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short, 15-minute yoga session described to 'build heat', which suggests a light to moderate effort. The duration and the chill music support a light intensity, suitable for beginners, although some poses may require moderate effort especially for those less fit, justifying the scores. The absence of intense cardio or high-intensity cues supports this classification.",
