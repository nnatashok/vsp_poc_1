  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description lists exercises like planks, ab roll-ups, squats, and prone push-ups, which are commonly performed on a mat. The category 'On The Mat' strongly implies a mat is integral to the workout. This results in a very high confidence score of 0.9 for the Mat being required equipment, as it is explicitly mentioned in the metadata."
