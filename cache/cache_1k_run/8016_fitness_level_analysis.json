  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily a rowing session with a category tag of 'row' which allows for a classification of Beginner or Intermediate for technique difficulty. The format includes 2-minute intervals which are straightforward to execute and do not require complex movements, thus fitting well within the Beginner category. The mention of an 'Intermediate' user fitness requirement suggests some level of technical ability beyond absolute beginner, hence the score also reflects some elements of Intermediate complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is just over 21 minutes with interval training at a max rhythm of 30. This combination of duration and interval intensity suggests a Moderate level of effort difficulty due to the manageable energy expenditure expected from 2-minute interval sessions. However, the workout is categorized under 'sweat' and tagged with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicating it could also pose a significant challenge, particularly for deconditioned users, fitting a lower Challenging score as well.",
