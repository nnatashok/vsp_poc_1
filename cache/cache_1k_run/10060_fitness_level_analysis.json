Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is just 5 minutes and 43 seconds, a typical length for a cool-down session, where physical demands are minimal. The mention of 'Take a breath, slow down your rhythm' and the focus on rhythm reduction suggest very low energy expenditure, solidifying a Light effort difficulty classification. The goal of the session is relaxation and recuperation rather than physical exertion, leading to very strong alignment with the Light effort level.",
