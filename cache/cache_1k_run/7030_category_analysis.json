  "categoriesExplanation": "The metadata provides strong evidence that this workout falls into both 'HIIT' and 'Indoor rowing' categories. The title \"Pyramid HIIT Row\" explicitly mentions HIIT, indicating a high-intensity interval training focus. The description reinforces this with phrases like \"high intensity drive\" and \"test your limits.\" The mention of a \"pyramid\" format is typical for HIIT workouts, where intensity and work intervals are varied in a structured manner. The intensity level of 3 out of 3 further supports a high-intensity classification, justified by the genre of music\u2014Rock Mid-intensity and Global Hits\u2014that typically accompanies vigorous workout sessions. Moreover, the category tags 'drive, standard, row' and maximum rhythm of 36 suggest a rowing component, confirming its alignment with indoor rowing exercises. Given the structured format and intensity described, other categories like 'Mat', 'Yoga', or 'Stretching' are excluded due to contrasting attributes with the main HIIT and rowing focus, both conveying the most appropriate classification indicators."
