  "categoriesExplanation": "The title 'March Race: Week 1 of 4' and the description 'rack up those meters' clearly indicate a competitive and goal-oriented session, which aligns with rowing workouts often focusing on distance or racing. The mention of 'high rhythms' and 'Power' format suggests a focus on speed and intensity typical of indoor rowing workouts aiming for new personal bests. The use of terms like 'drive' and 'row' in the workout type and category further confirms the activity as rowing. The intensity level of 3 out of 3 also supports the classification as an intensive rowing session rather than a more relaxed exercise. The absence of specific other equipment in the metadata reduces the likelihood of this involving other activities. Therefore, the main category chosen is 'Indoor rowing' with very high confidence."
