  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing-based session ('workoutType: breathe', 'category: row') which typically involves simple to moderately complex movement patterns. The rowing rhythm of 18-24 is manageable and doesn't demand high technical skills. Given the Beginner user requirement, it's clear the technique difficulty is primarily 'Beginner'. The 'Power' format might slightly increase coordination requirements, thus a minor alignment with 'Intermediate', but the main focus is on leg power with basic rhythms, reinforcing its beginner-friendly nature.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With an 'intensity level of 1 out of 3', this workout is classified as low intensity, aligning strongly with 'Light' effort difficulty. The duration exceeds 20 minutes, indicating prolonged activity, which slightly nudges it towards 'Moderate'. However, considering the overall low-intensity rating and lack of high-energy demands (like fast tempos or significant power requirements), it remains primarily a 'Light' effort exercise session.",
