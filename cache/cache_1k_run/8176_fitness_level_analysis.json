  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and 'breathe', suggesting a focus on rhythm and pacing over technical complexity. The sequence of rhythms (18, 22, 24) introduces some variation, but rowing generally remains a low-complexity activity.\nSince this is a row-focused workout and the drill includes maintaining specific rhythms, mastering this requires some coordination but not advanced knowledge, fitting well into Beginner and Intermediate levels. There are no complex rowing techniques indicated.\nThe title 'Low Rhythm Row' and a workout intensity of '1 out of 3' suggest the exercises are accessible to beginners, with minimal technique learning needed, aligning strongly with a Beginner rating, while still offering some intermediate challenge due to rhythm changes.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, lasting 21 minutes and 13 seconds, includes rowing at specified rhythms with a maximum rhythm of 24, suggesting a moderate pace. The term 'breathe' implies a focus on control and endurance rather than intensity, while the workout intensity level is rated '1 out of 3', reinforcing that it's not highly energy-demanding. The playlist with dance and global hits aligns with maintaining a steady, engaging pace without pushing too hard. This places the effort difficulty predominantly at the Light level but with elements of Moderate due to duration and rhythm variations.",
