  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is only 10 minutes and 51 seconds long, which is short in duration, indicating low physical demand. The workout is classified as 'On The Mat', further suggesting limited intensity and energy expenditure. Pilates typically involves controlled, low-impact movements that focus on stability rather than intense cardio or strength, supporting a primarily 'Light' effort classification with marginal 'Moderate' due to the focus on core engagement.",
