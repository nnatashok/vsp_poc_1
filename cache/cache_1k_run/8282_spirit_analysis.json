  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Post-Row Pilates' workout is strongly aligned with the Soothing & Restorative spirit. This is indicated by the emphasis on building strength and adding stretch, which are typical of restorative sessions, and the relaxing nature of Pilates. The music choice of 'Hands Clean' and 'Landslide' by Alanis Morissette and The Chicks, coupled with the 80's and Global Hits stations, suggests a calming atmosphere, enhancing this spirit (score: 0.9).\n\nThe Outdoor & Adventure spirit is also significant due to the setting by the water in the image provided, indicating an outdoor environment. This connection with nature supports exploration and adventure (score: 0.7).\n\nLastly, there is a moderate element of Flow & Rhythm, suggested by the Pilates focus and the smooth, continuous movements it involves. However, without direct information on rhythm-based cues or music-driven pacing, this classification holds a slightly lesser weight (score: 0.6). \n\nThe structured and intense spirits are excluded given the session's emphasis on relaxation and the absence of high-energy or disciplined elements."
