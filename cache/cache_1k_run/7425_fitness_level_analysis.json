  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category with a 'Breathe' format, indicating a focus on steady, controlled rowing, which aligns with Beginner technique difficulty. Rowing generally involves straightforward movements, supported by the 'Beginner' user fitness requirement and the relatively low intensity of the session (intensity level 1 out of 3). The mention of James's coaching style, which emphasizes empowerment and confidence-building, also supports the simplicity of movements. The 11-minute duration further aligns with this classification as it does not demand complex technical skill.",
