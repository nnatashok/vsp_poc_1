  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the description highlighting '2.5-minute rowing intervals' and a 'whole body dumbbell circuit.' The focus on movement and circuit training, along with the title, strongly indicate an intense, fast-paced session. The usage of Hip Hop/R&B and Global Hits music genres supports this high-energy vibe, leading to a high confidence score of 0.9.\n\nThe spirit 'Structured & Disciplined' is also applicable, indicated by the organized format of alternating rowing and dumbbell exercises, along with the specific 2.5-minute intervals, which implies a methodical approach. Therefore, it receives a score of 0.7.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is considered with a score of 0.4 due to the mention of rhythm in the metadata. However, it is less emphasized compared to the high-energy and structured aspects.\n\nOutdoor or adventure elements are excluded as the session is conducted on-the-mat indoors, and it is not specifically focused on sports or agility."
