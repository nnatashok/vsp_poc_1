  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Technique Cool-Down' is primarily classified under 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe. The 10-minute duration, and the emphasis on technique during rowing strokes, suggests a focus on skill-building and mastering the rowing form, reflected in keywords like 'technique focused' and 'reinforce technique.' This aligns well with features of a Masterclass workout involving concentrated, technique-driven activity. The confidence score of 0.8 indicates a strong match due to clear goal-oriented language in the metadata.\n\nIn addition, 'The Meditative Grind' is a secondary vibe due to the repetitive, steady nature of the rowing activity at a max rhythm of 24, supporting a focused, meditatively repetitive workout. The flow and measured pace contribute to a more meditative experience, allowing rowers to zone in on their form and movements. Pop low and Global Hits music could provide a rhythmic but calming background, supporting a meditative vibe. Thus, a score of 0.7 is assigned to this secondary vibe given the steady rhythm and focus on form."
