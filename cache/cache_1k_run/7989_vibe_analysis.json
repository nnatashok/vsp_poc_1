  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Express Bootcamp HIIT Row,' suggests a high-intensity experience typical of 'The Warrior Workout' vibe. The workout's description of 'quick intervals at rhythms 28 and 30' indicates a fast-paced, sweat-dripping session. The duration of 11 minutes and 15 seconds aligns with the explosive and intense nature of HIIT workouts. The intensity level of 3 out of 3 further emphasizes this vibe, which earns a strong score of 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of gamified elements in the 'Competitor' vibe is suggested by the structured intervals and high-intensity challenge, scoring a 0.7. The use of dance and global hit radio stations suggests a motivating and energetic atmosphere, enhancing the warrior-like focus. While one could consider elements of 'The Endorphin Wave' or 'The Adrenaline Rush,' the workout leans more towards competitive and warrior-like aspects due to the HIIT format and maximum rhythm of 30."
