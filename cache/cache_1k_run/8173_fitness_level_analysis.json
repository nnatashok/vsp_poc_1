  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is essentially a 15-minute stretching routine, which is not physically taxing. The lack of intense physical activity and the inclusion of a foam roller for comfort reinforce that this routine requires low energy expenditure, making it a perfect fit for the Light effort difficulty level. This classification is strongly aligned given the video's content and short duration.",
