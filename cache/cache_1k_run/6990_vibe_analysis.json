  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Prepare for Success Row' is designed as an interval rowing session with a high-intensity level of 3 out of 3. It features a format with increasing rhythms and short intervals, indicative of a steady and challenging pace. This suggests a strong match with 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, which represents elevated energy and feel-good movement, scoring a 0.7 due to the focus on rhythm-driven endurance paired with dance and global hit music.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Meditative Grind' is also relevant, scoring a 0.6, as the workout focuses on rowing, which often involves zoning in and letting repetition take over. The structured interval format aligns with a meditative, focused endurance session.\n\nThe music selection of dance tracks like 'Gold Dust' and 'Would You Ever' supports the energetic and rhythmic nature of the workout, reinforcing the vibe of consistent, uplifting energy which is why other vibes like 'The Nightclub Workout' or 'The Warrior Workout' were not selected due to lack of explicit dance or combat elements, respectively."
