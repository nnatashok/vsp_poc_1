Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 5 minutes and 35 seconds, which is very short, indicating low physical demand. It is a stretching routine, which generally requires low energy expenditure, especially when there is no emphasis on intensity or dynamic movements. The lack of equipment and the focus on muscle engagement rather than high-intensity work suggest a light effort difficulty. Thus, it strongly aligns with the Light category for effort difficulty.",
