  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is clearly focused on rowing, as indicated by the Workout Name 'Steady Adventure Row' and mention of 'maintaining a consistent split' which is a rowing-specific term. The description also outlines six intervals, suggesting an indoor rowing structure. The emphasis on maintaining pace aligns with rowing training practices. The music playlist and other elements like intensity level (1 out of 3) support a rhythmic and manageable pace consistent with rowing, and there is a direct category mention of 'row'. Hence, 'Indoor rowing' is the central defining characteristic here, with a very strong presence. Other potential categories like 'Breathing exercises' or 'Yoga' are excluded as the primary focus is rowing, despite the mention of 'breathe' in metadata. It is given high confidence because of these explicit cues."
