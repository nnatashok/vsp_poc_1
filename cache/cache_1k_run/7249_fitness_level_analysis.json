  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row' and falls under the 'standard' category, suggesting a typical rowing technique. In line with Hydrow-specific rules, technique difficulty for 'row' can be Beginner or Intermediate. The use of intervals typically requires some level of rhythm and coordination, aligning moderate complexity with 'Intermediate' but not exceeding it. Hence, it logically aligns with both Beginner and Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts over an hour and contains interval training with a max rhythm of 30, suggesting a variable intensity throughout the duration. Despite being rated a 2 out of 3 in intensity, the length and format of the workout produce a moderate to high energy output, aligning well with 'Moderate' for general deconditioned users and inching towards 'Challenging' for less fit users engaging in prolonged efforts.",
