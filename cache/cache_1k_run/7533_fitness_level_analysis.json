  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a brief, 5-minute warm-up, indicating low physical demand. The interval structure with 'Power 10s' suggests slightly elevated intensity than a continuous pace but remains light overall due to its duration and 'warm-up' classification, strongly aligning with Light (0.8) and weakly with Moderate (0.2) due to the intervals.",
