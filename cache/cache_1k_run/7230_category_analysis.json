  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is described as an 'align' routine with a focus on muscle and heart rate recovery after a rowing session. The inclusion of 'Yoga blocks recommended' and the name 'Post-Row Align' suggests elements of Yoga, likely a restorative or relaxation-focused session, thus justifying the Yoga category with a score of 0.7 for strong presence but not absolute certainty.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of recovery and the relaxed music genre implies some form of Stretching, contributing to a mild to moderate inclusion of the Stretching category with a score of 0.6 since it could also involve flexibility work as part of muscle recovery.\n\nThe playlist, with songs described as Chill and Cool/Downtempo, supports a calm and reflective session typical of Yoga or gentle stretching practices. The absence of high-energy or intense descriptors lowers the likelihood of higher-intensity categories, focusing instead on relaxation and alignment."
