  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts about 15 minutes and uses resistance bands for strengthening, suggesting a moderate level of physical demand. While it's meant for posture improvement, which is generally less intense, the inclusion of resistance training slightly raises the effort to the moderate level. However, given its short duration and focus on posture and upper body, it's unlikely to be too physically overwhelming, thus remaining largely within the moderate category, with a slight inclination towards challenging for very deconditioned users.",
