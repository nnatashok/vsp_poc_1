  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is composed of bodyweight exercises, conducted over a short duration of 5 minutes and 37 seconds, suggesting a 'Light' effort difficulty, suitable for beginners. However, the focus on core strength might involve sustained muscle engagement over the session, slightly increasing the intensity for less conditioned users, hence also a weak 'Moderate' rating. The lack of advanced technique or high-intensity cues in the metadata supports a primary identification as 'Light'.",
