  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of this workout is 5 minutes, which is quite short, suggesting a light effort level should be sufficient for most users (score 0.8). The 'strength' focus with past Olympian guidance implies some moderate exertion but not overwhelming, leading to a moderate effort classification as well (score 0.5). The description used does not imply high-intensity exercises typical of challenging or extreme levels.",
