  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Power Strokes Warm-Up' suggests a focus on preparing both mentally and physically with 'quick and powerful strokes,' making it fitting for 'The Meditative Grind' vibe (0.7). The interval format and rowing align with the meditative, repetitive nature of endurance exercises. Although it's a warm-up, the music selection, featuring upbeat and motivational tracks like 'Walking On A Dream' and 'Never Give Up,' hints at an energizing atmosphere, contributing to a secondary 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe (0.5). The music genre, Indie Alternative and Global Hits, further implies a motivational yet steady progression typical of an endorphin-building session. The absence of specified music genres leads to moderate confidence (0.75) in these classifications."
