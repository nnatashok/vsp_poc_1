  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row,' which typically suggests beginner to intermediate technique difficulty. The steady pace and rhythm of 20 to 24 with a focus on breathing ('breathe' workout type) further suggests simplicity in execution. With an intensity level of 1 out of 3 and the user fitness requirement at the beginner level, the technique difficulty leans strongly towards 'Beginner,' with a minor possibility of some coordination complexity making it marginally intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, 'Feel Good Row,' involves a 16-minute steady pace rowing at a light to moderate rhythm with an intensity level marked as 1 out of 3. These details suggest it is not highly physically demanding, making the effort difficulty predominantly 'Light.' However, due to the rhythmic component and continuous rowing, there is a slight possibility of it veering into 'Moderate' for very deconditioned users, contributing to the mixed score.",
