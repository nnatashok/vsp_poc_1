  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under the 'row' category, which limits the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. The description emphasizes a focus on maintaining a steady pace and proper form, facilitated by an instructor with an endurance background, suggesting that the movements are straightforward and not technically demanding. This aligns with a Beginner classification, as the emphasis is on a consistent 20-24 rhythm rather than complex or variable movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout description indicates a light, steady-paced session with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, suggesting it is not particularly demanding physically. The duration of 16:23 minutes is relatively short, and the focus on maintaining a steady rhythm aligns with a Light effort classification for beginners who are deconditioned. Although slightly engaging for new rowers, the overall low intensity and short duration also justify considering a slight overlap into the Moderate level.",
