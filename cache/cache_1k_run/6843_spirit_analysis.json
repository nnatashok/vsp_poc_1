  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Endurance Intervals Row' is classified primarily under 'Structured & Disciplined' due to its focus on alternating stroke rates and the interval format, which suggest methodical training and technical precision. The description specifies strokes per minute (22, 26, and 28), indicative of a structured approach. This justifies a high score of 0.9 for this spirit. \n\nThe included image showing rowing on a river leads to the classification under 'Outdoor & Adventure'. The natural setting and the activity of rowing inherently support this spirit, especially since it\u2019s recorded outdoors, earning it a score of 0.8.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant as the workout involves continuous rowing sequences, which, coupled with the pop and global hits music, suggests an element of rhythm. This results in a moderate score of 0.5. \n\nThe classification has high confidence (0.9) due to explicit indicators of structure and outdoor environment, and the rhythmic elements further support the analysis. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are less relevant here, given the endurance, intervals, and sweat emphasis."
