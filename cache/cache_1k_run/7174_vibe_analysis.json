  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'De-Stress Restorative Yoga' is primarily characterized by its calming and relaxing focus, as indicated by the description which mentions 'calm your mind and relax your body.' This aligns strongly with 'The Zen Flow' vibe due to its emphasis on grounding and intentional breath-centered movement. The use of tags like 'restore' and 'On The Mat' suggests a gentle, introspective session, further reinforcing this classification. The music described as 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' supports a tranquil vibe, fitting well with both 'The Zen Flow' and 'The Deep Recharge.' The short duration of 6 minutes hints at a quick yet effective session for relaxation, making 'The Deep Recharge' another relevant vibe due to its focus on nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement. The lack of specified instructor and the setting in Seville add an ambiance of open spaces, complementing these vibes. The confidence level is high due to the consistency of these elements in portraying a soothing and restorative experience."
