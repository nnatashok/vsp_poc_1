  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Years End Row' is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the presence of HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) format mentioned in the description. The focus on 45-second intervals and the maximum rhythm of 34 further underscores the workout's intense nature. The playlist featuring upbeat songs like 'Wake Me Up' and 'Celebration' supports a high-energy atmosphere. The intensity level of 3 out of 3 indicates a demanding workout, aligning closely with this spirit, thus scoring it at 0.9 for a strong match.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also assigned due to the workout being conducted on a river, as shown in the image provided. This natural setting emphasizes the spirit of adventure and exploration, scoring it a solid 0.8. \n\nOther potential spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are not applicable due to the absence of elements focused on gentle or continuous movement patterns or relaxation."
