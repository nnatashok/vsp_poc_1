Given the basic and steady rhythm at 18 and the 'breathe' workout type, which suggests simplicity and ease, it strongly aligns with the Beginner level (score: 1.0). The faint alignment with Intermediate (score: 0.2) is due to potential minor complexities of maintaining a consistent pace, although these are minimal.",
