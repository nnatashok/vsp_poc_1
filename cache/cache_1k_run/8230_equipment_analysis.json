  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Bodyweight Strength' and described explicitly as involving 'all bodyweight exercises,' indicating no additional equipment is required beyond a supportive surface. The category 'On The Mat' strongly suggests the use of a mat for exercises performed on the ground, providing stability and comfort. The image attached shows an individual exercising on a mat, reinforcing this. Therefore, a 'Mat' is identified with very high confidence (0.9) as the necessary equipment for this workout. Other equipment types are unnecessary for performing the described exercises."
