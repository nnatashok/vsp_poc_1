  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout 'Stay Steady Together Row' involves maintaining a steady rhythm of 22 to 24 strokes per minute. Rowing, especially at a steady and moderate pace, is generally considered beginner-friendly as indicated by the 'breathe' format and beginner-level requirement. Rowing primarily involves basic movements that require less technical complexity. Therefore, the technique difficulty aligns more with a Beginner level (0.8) but can have a slight Intermediate consideration (0.2) due to rhythm variations.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This rowing workout has a duration of approximately 21 minutes at low intensity (1 out of 3). The 'breathe' workout type, alongside the steady rowing rhythm, indicates a Light effort level (0.7), suitable for beginners since rowing at consistent, moderate paces does not severely tax physical exertion. However, the rhythmic consistency over the 21-minute duration can present a Moderate challenge (0.3) due to sustained activity.",
