  "spiritsExplanation": "The title 'Confidence Building Row' suggests a focus on personal development through challenging workouts. The description highlights a HIIT format with a maximum rhythm of 34, which indicates a fast-paced, exhausting session typical of High-Energy & Intense workouts. The context provided by the instructor Mike Dostal, a seasoned rowing champion, and the highest intensity level (3 out of 3) further reinforces this classification, scoring 0.9 for High-Energy & Intense due to strong evidence of vigorous activity.\n\nThe emphasis on Mike's technical expertise and achievements points to a Structured & Disciplined spirit, with an emphasis on technique and precision characteristic of a former national team member. The use of the term 'HIIT' and the structured intensity level also align with disciplined training, justifying a score of 0.7.\n\nAlthough the workout emphasizes rhythm and community, indicating possible elements of Flow & Rhythm, the lack of detailed information about music-driven pacing and smoothness reduces confidence for this spirit. Therefore, it was not included. The classification mainly draws from indicators of intensity and Mike's structured coaching style."
