  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Core Burn Express Pilates\" is primarily classified under \"Flow & Rhythm\" with a score of 0.7. This is due to the nature of Pilates, which emphasizes smooth, continuous movements and a strong mind-body connection. Additionally, the music genre, Chill mid and Cool/Downtempo, supports a rhythmic flow atmosphere.\n\nThe \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is also present with a score of 0.8. The workout appears to be set by a river, as indicated by the image and description, lending it an outdoor ambiance. This setting further emphasizes the exploration and natural element of the workout.\n\nHigh-energy intensity is unlikely due to the calming music and Pilates classification. Structured & Disciplined does not apply strongly as there is no mention of precise or rigid protocol. Despite the core focus, the workout's overall ambiance leans towards flow and outdoor elements."
