  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 15 minutes long, with a focus on improving mobility and flexibility through bodyweight exercises. These typically involve low intensity, targeting the enhancement of movement and posture rather than high energy expenditure, aligning with 'Light' effort difficulty. Given the short duration and focus, the energy consumption is minimal, and there are likely ample rest intervals. Therefore, it is most appropriate for users with lower fitness levels or those seeking gentle activity, earning a high score for 'Light.'",
