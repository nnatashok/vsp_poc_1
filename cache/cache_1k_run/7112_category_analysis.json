  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Indoor rowing' due to explicit references in the metadata. The workout's name and description clearly mention rowing, which directly suggests the use of a rowing machine. The phrase 'row with your eyes closed' strongly indicates that the primary activity is rowing. Additionally, terms like 'Max rhythm: 22' and 'Format: Steady' align with rowing workout specifics, further supporting this category. The mention of a 'cool down' also suggests a lower intensity, often associated with rowing sessions. The confidence level is high, at 0.85, due to these clear indicators in the metadata."
