  "vibesExplanation": "The workout has a strong focus on technique and skill-building, which aligns with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe due to its Pilates-based structure focused on isolating and strengthening the glutes. This is supported by the description highlighting strength-building in a quick, focused format, earning it a score of 0.8.\n\nThe music playlist featuring hip hop and R&B adds an element of rhythm and enjoyment, aligning somewhat with 'The Groove Session.' While Pilates is not typically dance-oriented, the choice of music adds a fun and expressive layer to the workout. The score of 0.6 reflects this secondary association as the music may enhance the expressive, rhythmic side of this workout.\n\nThe explicit mention of music, combined with the Pilates format, excludes more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.' Instead, the workout is seen as a focused, technique-driven session with an expressive, musical element."
