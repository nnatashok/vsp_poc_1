  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is based on rowing, which generally fits within 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its repetitive, endurance nature. The use of '2 and 1-minute intervals' suggests a rhythmic and sustained effort, typical for this vibe. The description about 'Mike and his family's story' adds a personal and engaging element, enhancing this classification.\n\nHowever, the 'Drive' type and 'intensity level: 3 out of 3' indicate a high-intensity element, aligning also with 'The Endorphin Wave', characterized by elevated energy and feel-good movement. The music from 'Rock Mid-intensity' and 'Global Hits' further support this with upbeat and motivating cues.\n\nThe lack of detailed explicit intensity details lowers absolute certainty. Overall, there is a high confidence (0.75) that these vibes are accurate, but specifics such as music transitions could refine this evaluation."
