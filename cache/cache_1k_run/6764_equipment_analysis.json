  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's category 'row' strongly suggests that a rowing machine is central to the workout, especially since no other equipment is mentioned in the metadata. This equipment is confirmed by both the word 'row' in the category and the term 'Technique,' indicating emphasis on rowing form. Despite the cool-down and stretching elements, the primary focus appears to be on rowing, leading to a very high confidence score of 0.9 for the rowing machine being required."
