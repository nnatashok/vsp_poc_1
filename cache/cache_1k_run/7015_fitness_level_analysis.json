  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 20 minutes and focus on pilates movements, this workout induces moderate physical exertion. While pilates itself can be low-impact, the mention of \"circuits\" suggests a slightly increased level of activity, which places it in the range of Light to Moderate effort for less fit individuals. The lack of equipment further suggests a manageable intensity level suitable for deconditioned participants.",
