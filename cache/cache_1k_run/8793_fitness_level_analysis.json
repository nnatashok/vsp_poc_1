  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout type is 'row', based on Hydrow's specific classification, the technique difficulty should be assessed as either Beginner or Intermediate. The format 'Interval' suggests some rhythm requirements, aligning well with Intermediate, but without explicit mention of technical rowing skills or high complexity, a Beginner score also applies. Given the intermediate User Fitness Level Requirement, Beginner and Intermediate are both plausible fits, with higher confidence in Beginner due to lack of explicit complexity indicators.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 21 minutes long, consisting of challenging five and six minute intervals, which aligns well with a Moderate to Challenging effort difficulty. The playlist features energetic tracks, and the workout's stated intensity (2 out of 3) suggest significant exertion. Although the intervals and rhythm (max 28) contribute to a potentially challenging session, the 21-minute overall duration caps its intensity, making it more moderately challenging than extremely intense.",
