  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing-based session categorized under 'sweat', featuring intervals. According to Hydrow-specific rules, the Technique Difficulty for rowing workouts can only be rated as Beginner or Intermediate. The workout's format involves interval training, which requires some coordination to manage pace and rhythm effectively, suggesting an Intermediate rating. However, beginner rowers could still attempt the workout with reduced intensity, justifying the Beginner consideration as well. The confidence in this classification is supported by the format and the description of the workout.",
