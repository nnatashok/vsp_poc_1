  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is classified as 'Drive', which Hydrow explicitly rates as Advanced. The inclusion of 'high-intensity intervals' and a max rhythm of 32 suggests complex pacing and coordination. While rowing can vary in technique difficulty, the 'Drive' category indicates a higher skill requirement for executing intense interval sessions with proper form.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 21 minutes combined with an intensity level of 3 out of 3 and a format of HIIT indicates a high level of physical exertion. The metadata highlights 'high-intensity intervals' and a supporting intense music playlist, which implies significant energy expenditure. The presence of HIIT further aligns with an 'Extreme' effort level for most users, especially for those in poor physical shape.",
