Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 16 minutes and low-to-moderate energy playlist indicate a generally light to moderate effort workout. The description of building 'heat' suggests some level of physical activity, yet 'flow' and 'chill/mid-tempo' music imply a gentler intensity. The session is likely not demanding enough to be challenging for the core audience but sufficient to elevate heart rate slightly, justifying a mix of Light and Moderate categorization.",
