  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as a 'Drive' type, which Hydrow-specific rules denote as having 'Advanced' technique difficulty. The 'Drive' category typically involves complex coordination, intense focus, and technical rowing execution. The power format and high rhythm of 38+ strokes per minute further suggest a need for advanced rowing skill and body control to maintain form under intense conditions.",
