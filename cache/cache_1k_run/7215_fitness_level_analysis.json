Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "As a 'cool down' activity with a short duration of 5:41 minutes, the intensity is inherently low, leading to a very low energy expenditure, which strongly aligns with Light effort difficulty. The pace is gentle ('two strokes on two strokes off') and rhythm is at a maximum of 20, typically low for rowing. These factors indicate it is highly suitable for deconditioned users seeking minimal exertion. There may be a weak alignment with Moderate due to the possibility of some effort in maintaining technique, but the overwhelming evidence supports a Light classification.",
