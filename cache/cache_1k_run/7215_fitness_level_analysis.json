  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is short, at just under 6 minutes, and is categorized as a 'cool down'. Such sessions are typically designed for low intensity and relaxation rather than high energy expenditure. The focus on reinforcing technique rather than intensity, combined with a moderate max rhythm, supports a Light effort difficulty classification at a score of 0.9. Users are unlikely to find the workout physically demanding.",
