  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of just over 10 minutes suggests a low effort requirement, which aligns with the Light effort difficulty. The focus on upper body strength indicates some degree of muscle engagement but without equipment or intense cardio, it is unlikely to be very demanding. Beginner-friendly descriptions suggest ease, supporting Light difficulty, but the addition of strength exercises introduces a minor element of Moderate exertion.",
