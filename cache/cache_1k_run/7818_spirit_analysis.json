  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified with a strong confidence as 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to the image showing rowing on a river. This aligns with the spirit's emphasis on nature and outdoor settings (score: 0.8). Additionally, the term 'rhythm 22' in the description and the steady rowing format suggests a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit to a moderate degree, focusing on maintaining a consistent pace and coordination, supported by the use of music from genres like Indie Alternative and Global Hits (score: 0.6). The mention of 'steady fundamentals' and structure of 5-minute segments indicates a 'Structured & Disciplined' approach, aiming for technical precision, especially given the focus on arms, core, and legs separately (score: 0.7). The intensity level is low, excluding 'High-Energy & Intense' as a relevant spirit. Overall, the metadata and image strongly support these spirits."
