Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 31 minutes, the session builds 'heat' which implies a moderate level of sustained physical effort throughout. The twisting and leg strengthening components add to the intensity, but without high-impact actions or rapid pace increases, it remains moderately challenging. The use of music categorized as 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' suggests a moderate overall energy expenditure rather than pushing into extreme or highly challenging levels. However, the focus on power and strength could make it somewhat challenging for less fit users.",
