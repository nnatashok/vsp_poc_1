  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 31 minutes long and involves a 'power flow,' which typically is a more dynamic and physically engaging form of yoga. The absence of music specifically indicating a high tempo or fast pace suggests that while the workout is engaging, it is not excessively intense. Therefore, the effort level is best classified as Moderate, with some potential for being Challenging due to the potential intensity of continuous flow yoga.",
