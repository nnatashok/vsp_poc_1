  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Technique Tips Cool-Down' and described as providing both rowing and mental skills tips suggests a focus on technique and mental engagement. This aligns with 'The Masterclass Workout,' characterized by skill-building and technique focus. The 10-minute duration and emphasis on a steady cool-down align with 'The Meditative Grind,' capturing the repetitive, calm vibe often associated with rowing-related workouts. The music playlist, featuring 'Pop low' and 'Global Hits,' implies a gentle, feel-good experience, also fitting 'The Reboot Workout,' designed for relaxation and refreshment post-exercise. The absence of high intensity and the focus on cool-down and technique leads to these vibes with moderate confidence."
