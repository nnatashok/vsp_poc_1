  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Drop Your Split: Recovery Cool-Down' focuses on recovery and breathing, which aligns well with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, scoring a strong 0.9. This vibe is supported by the workout type 'cool down' and the description that emphasizes a 'comfortable pace' and 'recovery.' Additionally, the music described as 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' further aligns with a relaxing, restorative focus.\n\nThere is a secondary element of 'The Zen Flow' vibe present, with a score of 0.6, due to the emphasis on intentional breathing and a steady pace, suggesting a slower, grounding flow. 'Zen Flow' is more about breath-centered and intentional movement, which the workout partially embodies.\n\nThe confidence in these classifications is high (0.85), given the explicit indications of recovery and relaxation in the metadata, along with the calm music setup."
