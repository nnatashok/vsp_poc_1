  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is short in duration (11 minutes, 18 seconds) but is performed at high intensity, indicated by the Intensity Level being 3 out of 3 and described as 'race off at high rhythms'. This suggests significant energy expenditure and cardiovascular demand, fitting a 'Challenging' level, with elements of 'Extreme' due to its intensity.",
