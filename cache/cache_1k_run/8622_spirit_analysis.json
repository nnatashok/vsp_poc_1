  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Relaxed Hands Cool-Down,' strongly indicates a focus on relaxation and recovery, aligning it with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This is reinforced by the emphasis on 'relaxation in your upper body and hands' and the low intensity ('max rhythm: 20'), which is typical of a cool-down session. The environment, as depicted in the image of rowing on a river, supports an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, given the natural setting. The use of music genres such as Dance Mid and Global Hits suggests a mild element of rhythm, but the primary focus remains on relaxation rather than high energy or structured training. Therefore, 'Soothing & Restorative' is assigned a high score of 0.9, and 'Outdoor & Adventure' is assigned a score of 0.7."
