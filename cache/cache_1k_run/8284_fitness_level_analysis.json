  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized primarily as a 'drive' which Hydrow typically regards as 'Advanced'. However, considering the 'row' activity embedded within, this places the technique difficulty at the 'Intermediate' level. The 'drive' category suggests synchronized and powerful strokes at high rhythms of 28 to 32, necessitating a good grasp of rowing techniques, which aligns with an Intermediate rating.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The high-intensity cues, such as a maximum rhythm of 32 and a label of workout intensity level 3 out of 3, emphasize a taxing routine. The presence of a 'Power' format implies pushing hard with minimal rest, and the duration of 21 minutes suggests sustained high effort. These factors clearly position the workout in the 'Extreme' range for effort difficulty.",
