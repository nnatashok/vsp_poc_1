  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row' and under the 'Breathe' type, suggesting a focus on energy conservation and rhythmic movement, which are characteristics of beginner-friendly workouts. The use of an acoustic playlist implies a relaxed pace, aligning with lower complexity. Although 'Climb' format may imply incremental intensity, it is generally a beginner-level feature in rowing, justifying a high Beginner score, with minimal overlap into Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 21:23 minutes and formatting under 'Breathe' implies lower intensity and energy expenditure. The workout intensity level is marked '1 out of 3,' strongly suggesting a light exercise routine. The steady rhythm at a max of 26 strokes per minute indicates a controlled pace suitable for beginners, with only slight indications of increasing intensity, which aligns more with Light effort but notes a small potential for Moderate.",
