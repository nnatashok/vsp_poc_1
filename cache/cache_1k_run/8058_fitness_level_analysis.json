  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically restricts Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The format of 'Climb' suggests some complexity beyond basic rowing, but the maximum rhythm of 28 and the lack of any mentioned specific technical movements imply that the technique remains relatively straightforward. This aligns primarily with Beginner events, with some elements suggesting a mild shift towards Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 16 minutes coupled with a format labeled 'Climb' and a sweat-inducing type implies a moderate effort difficulty, given its focus on climbing intervals. The workout intensity level of 2 out of 3 further supports that there\u2019s a moderate, potentially reaching challenging energy expenditure. The music genre and tempo can promote engagement and exertion, suggesting a high-moderate demand with some challenging elements.",
