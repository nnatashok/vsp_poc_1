  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Gradual Climb Row' is characterized by a structured progression in rhythm, which suggests a steady buildup of energy typical of 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe. The metadata mentions a 'fast run pace' and 'climb format,' indicating an emphasis on endurance and rhythm, aligning with a score of 0.75 for this vibe. The format and consistency of climbing in rhythm one beat per minute also match 'The Meditative Grind,' with its repetitive and focused nature, warranting a score of 0.65. The inclusion of \"Pop mid\" and \"Global Hits\" in the playlist, featuring artists like Calvin Harris and Ariana Grande, infuses a fun and fluid musical experience, albeit less prominent, resulting in a score of 0.4 for 'The Groove Session.' The intense but structured nature of the workout aligns less with highly explosive or zen-focused vibes, which were excluded."
