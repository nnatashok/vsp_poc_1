  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Racing Rock Row' is characterized primarily by a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, supported by the high rhythm numbers and a rock playlist that features energetic tracks like 'I Wanna Rock' and 'Cum On Feel The Noize.' The workout is described as having an interval format with an intensity level of 3 out of 3, further emphasizing its intense nature. The second spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm,' is associated with the high rhythm numbers and the music-driven pacing typical of the classic rock playlist, which supports a continuous movement pattern. Lastly, the image shows the workout occurring in a natural outdoor setting, which, along with the fact that it's a rowing session recorded on water, justifies the inclusion of the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This environment adds an element of exploration and connection with nature, although it is not the primary focus of the workout."
