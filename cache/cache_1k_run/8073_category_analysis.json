  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout 'Power + Quickness Warm-Up' is characterized by its emphasis on rhythm and power, which are typical indicators of a dynamic and intense session, often found in rowing workouts. The term 'row' in the category suggests indoor rowing is a central theme, particularly since Bergen is mentioned, a city with strong rowing associations. The description highlights 'rhythm' and 'power', reinforcing the indoor rowing context, thus receiving a strong score of 0.7.\n\nThe inclusion of 'Climb' in the format suggests a gradual increase in intensity, often aligning with HIIT workouts' alternating intensity, as warm-ups can occasionally share similar structures. However, without explicit intervals of rest and activity, the HIIT score is moderate at 0.5.\n\nThe absence of detailed descriptions or equipment listings adds some ambiguity, but the overall metadata supports a primary focus on indoor rowing with HIIT elements included, especially considering the energizing music choice from artists known for their high-energy tracks."
