  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which limits the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. The workout type being 'sweat' and interval format with rhythm up to 28 suggest coordination might be required, leading to a moderate classification, thus aligning with Intermediate. However, as a rowing workout, it remains mostly in the Beginner to Intermediate range with little complex choreography needed.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 31 minutes long with an 'interval' format, suggesting variations in intensity that can increase physical demand. The intermediate workout level requirement and intensity of 2 out of 3 suggest it is more than light effort, hence both Moderate and Challenging effort levels are applicable, particularly for less fit users navigating intervals within this duration.",
