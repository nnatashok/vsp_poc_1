  "categoriesExplanation": "This workout is categorized as 'Mat' and 'Body weight' due to the nature of exercises like planks, lunges, RDLs, and up-downs mentioned in the workout description. The term 'On The Mat' in the category reinforces that the exercises are performed on a mat, suggesting floor-based activities typical of Mat workouts. 'Body weight' is another strong category as the exercises listed involve using the body's weight for resistance. There is no explicit mention of any additional equipment, supporting the focus on body weight exercises. A moderate confidence level of 0.75 is assigned based on clear indicators within the description. Other categories such as 'Weight workout' or 'Calisthenics' were excluded due to the lack of equipment and the focus on floor-based strength training."
