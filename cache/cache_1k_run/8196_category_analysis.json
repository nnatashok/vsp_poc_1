The description mentions 'intervals,' consistent with rowing formats that often involve varied pacing. Furthermore, the intensity level is noted as 3 out of 3, indicating a high-intensity workout, which aligns with many rowing workouts that employ interval training to maximize cardiovascular and muscular endurance.
