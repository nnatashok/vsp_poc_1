  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as 'Light' because the workout is a cool down with a short duration of just 5 minutes and 40 seconds, paired with low rhythms. These characteristics indicate low energy expenditure, suitable for complete beginners. The 'Moderate' level is slightly considered due to the mention of maintaining connection throughout the body which might require focus for those less familiar with rowing, yet the overall short and gentle nature of the workout supports 'Light' as the primary classification.",
