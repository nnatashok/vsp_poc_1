Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The cool-down nature of the workout, along with a short duration of 5 minutes and 40 seconds and a low rhythm of 20 strokes per minute, indicates very low physical demand, ideal for recovery and relaxation. This aligns strongly with a Light effort difficulty, given there's no intensity cue indicating significant energy expenditure. The inclusion of a very gentle rhythm suggests minimal exertion, making Light the most suitable classification, with a moderate rating given a low score due to the low intensity implied by the workout type.",
