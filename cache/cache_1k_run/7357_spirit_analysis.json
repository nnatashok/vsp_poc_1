  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Steady Cool-Down' clearly aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The description emphasizes cooling down and feeling better for future workouts, indicating a restorative focus. This is further supported by the max rhythm of 22, which suggests a slower, calming pace typical of recovery and cool-down sessions. The use of terms like 'cool down' and 'steady' further highlights this spirit, warranting a high confidence score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the image shows rowing on a river, fitting the 'Outdoor & Adventure' category. The natural setting supports a nature-based, explorative aspect of this spirit, especially since workouts conducted on rivers should be considered under this classification. This justifies a score of 0.6 for the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, as the setting offers a secondary, supportive aspect to the main restorative focus.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility', were excluded due to the lack of indicators for high intensity or sports-specific skills within the metadata or imagery."
