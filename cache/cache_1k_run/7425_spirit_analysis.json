  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Memorial Day Row' along the Charles River strongly embodies the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the outdoor setting on a river, as indicated by the title and description. This classification is supported by the inclusion of nature in the workout, meriting a perfect score of 1.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant, as the workout is categorized with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, suggesting a gentle or calming session. The description emphasizes a steady, mindful experience, supported by the playlist's country and global hits, which often evoke a mellow atmosphere. This spirit scores 0.7 due to the recovery-focused elements.\n\nLastly, the use of the term 'breathe' and a rhythm max of 22 suggests an element of 'Flow & Rhythm,' focusing on pacing and a connection between breath and movement. However, this is a secondary element, scoring 0.5, as the primary focus is more on the outdoor and restorative aspects.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are not applicable, given the low intensity and emphasis on relaxation."
