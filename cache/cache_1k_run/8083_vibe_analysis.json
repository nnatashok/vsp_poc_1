The music genre of 'Chill' and 'Cool/Downtempo' aligns with a relaxing and introspective vibe, reinforcing this choice. \n\nAdditionally, 'The Reboot Workout' is a secondary vibe with a score of 0.6 due to the focus on stretching and mobility intended to refresh and relieve tension, consistent with a total-body refresh. This is supported by the optional use of a foam roller and the gentle nature of the exercises.
