  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'All Around Warm-Up' is conducted outdoors, leveraging the setting of the Port of LA. The presence of water and visible environment contributes strongly to the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, scoring 0.9 due to explicit mention of the location. The description mentions 'gradually build in rhythm,' indicating a smooth, coordinated workout, which aligns with 'Flow & Rhythm' scoring 0.7. The use of pop and global hits music further supports this as it enhances the rhythmic flow, aligning with flow-based pacing. There is no indication of high intensity or restorative focus, and the structured interval format is secondary in this context. These environments reduce the likelihood of a 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'High-Energy & Intense' classification."
