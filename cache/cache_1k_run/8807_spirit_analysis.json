  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to several key indicators. The workout description mentions rowing along the Hillsborough River, signaling an outdoor, nature-based setting. This is reinforced by the naming of the location, a typical trait of outdoor workouts. Hence, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit scores 0.85, indicating a strong match.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is relevant as the workout format involves intervals, a structure that suggests a potential rhythm and flow to the exercise. The inclusion of specific radio stations like Hip Hop/R&B Mid and Global Hits implies a musical influence on the pacing, contributing to a score of 0.6 as it suggests coordination and music-driven pacing.\n\nLastly, 'High-Energy & Intense' is also applicable to a moderate degree. The workout's category 'sweat' and the intermediate intensity level indicates a focus on cardiovascular effort and maintaining a high energy output, thereby fitting this spirit with a score of 0.45. Other spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative', 'Structured & Disciplined', or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to lack of specific supporting details."
