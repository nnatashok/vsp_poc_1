  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.8 due to its gentle Pilates nature emphasized by the focus on stretching and muscle activation post-rowing (\"ignite your glutes and stretch your chest\"). Pilates is typically reflective of a restorative approach. \n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Outdoor & Adventure' at a 0.6 score, influenced by the visual context of the workout taking place on a wooden platform near water. This suggests an outdoor setting which aligns with natural and explorative elements.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' receives a lower score of 0.4 due to the playlist's dance and global hits, which may influence a rhythm-based approach, but this isn't the primary focus given the pilates method.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' do not apply due to the absence of high-intensity intervals or strict training regimens in the session."
