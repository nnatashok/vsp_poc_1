Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is short in duration (less than 6 minutes) and is explicitly designed as a \"cool down,\" indicating a very low-intensity effort with the primary goal of gradually reducing heart rate. This typically involves light rowing at a slow pace, signaled by the steady rhythm with a max at 24 strokes per minute. While there might be a slight cardio engagement, the primary activity is rest-oriented, warranting a Light effort difficulty with some consideration for Moderate based on individual fitness variance.",
