  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is approximately 31 minutes, which is relatively short. Combined with the restorative focus, this indicates a lower energy expenditure. The playlist featuring 'Chill mid' and 'Cool/Downtempo' radio stations supports a relaxed pace, suitable for a light effort classification. 'Yoga flow' might introduce a small measure of moderate exertion due to continuous movement, but the overall demand remains light to moderate.",
