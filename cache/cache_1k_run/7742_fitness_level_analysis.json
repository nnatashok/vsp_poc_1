  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'sweat' under the Hydrow platform rules suggests rowing, which generally ranges from Beginner to Intermediate in technique difficulty, as rowing involves straightforward movements with minimal coordination required. The lack of any mention of advanced techniques or equipment keeps the technique complexity low. Therefore, the bulk of the classification leans towards Beginner, but the presence of a 'Climb' format and rhythm details allow for a slight elevation to Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 21 minutes and 22 seconds combined with a rhythm max of 26 indicates a moderate pace, typical for a 'sweat' workout with an intensity level of 2 out of 3. This points to a moderate energy expenditure suitable for low-to-medium levels. However, the climbing aspect and rock music playlist suggest a slight increase in intensity, thus cautiously grading part of it as Challenging.",
