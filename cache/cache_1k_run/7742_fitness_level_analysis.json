  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which inherently limits the Technique Difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. The moderate rhythm (max rhythm of 26) suggests some coordination is needed but not extensively so, leading to a score slightly favoring Beginner. This aligns with the technique requirement of basic rowing, which is straightforward.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the session is just over 21 minutes, which suggests a moderate-effort expenditure. The format 'Climb' and 'Sweat' category, alongside intensity level 2 out of 3, imply a challenging aspect but not extremely so. The rock playlist often associated with higher intensity further supports a Moderate difficulty, which is challenging enough for deconditioned users.",
