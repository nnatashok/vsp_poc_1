  "vibesExplanation": "The workout \"Performance Mindset Row\" fits primarily into \"The Meditative Grind\" vibe. The description mentions intervals and a focus on conquering the 'performance mindset,' highlighting a repetitive, focused approach typical of this vibe. The intensity level 2 out of 3 suggests a consistent challenge without extreme peaks, further supporting this classification. \n\n\"The Endorphin Wave\" is also a good fit due to the use of motivating alternative rock and pop music from artists like Imagine Dragons and P!NK. The upbeat, high-energy songs align with the experience of a steady build in energy, typical for this vibe. \n\nThe absence of extreme highs in intensity and the focus on rhythm and mindset exclude \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Adrenaline Rush,\" as these suggest more intense, unpredictable experiences. Overall, the workout leans towards a focused, rhythmical challenge with moderate intensity and motivational elements."
