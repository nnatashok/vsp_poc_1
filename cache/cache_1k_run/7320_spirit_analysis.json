  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily focused on technique and cooling down, which aligns well with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, given that it emphasizes methodical practice and precision in rowing technique. The descriptor \"Technique Focused\" and the format being technique-based further reinforce this selection, justifying a score of 0.75.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is pertinent as it is a cool-down session, designed to help the body recover and relax after intense activity. The presence of a calm music playlist, including tracks like 'The Luckiest' by Ben Folds, suggests a calming atmosphere typical of restorative workouts, warranting a score of 0.65.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' and similar high-intensity spirits are excluded due to the explicit indication that the session is a cool-down, not designed for intense exertion."
