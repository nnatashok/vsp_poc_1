  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Sprint Intervals Row' is clearly indicative of a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The use of 'sprinting intervals' and 'anaerobic capacity' in the description, along with the highest intensity level (3 out of 3), strongly support this classification. The playlist featuring energetic dance hits, such as 'Big Energy' and songs by Ti\u00ebsto, further reinforce the high-intensity vibe of the workout, achieving a score of 1.0.\n\nAdditionally, the session occurs in the 'Port of LA', an outdoor setting, which complements the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The rowing activity recorded on a river aligns well with the geographical and exploratory aspect of this spirit, leading to a score of 0.8. The strong interplay between intensity-focused interval training in an outdoor environment supports a dual classification with a blend of adventure and high energy."
