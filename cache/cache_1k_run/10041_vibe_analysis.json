  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Power Climb Row,' indicates a focus on rowing intervals that engage the legs and core, suggesting a rhythmic and repetitive nature typical of 'The Meditative Grind.' The climb format and the emphasis on strokes foster a zoning-in experience, further supporting this vibe. This classification is enhanced by the 11-minute duration and middle intensity level, which align with a focused, endurance-like session. The use of 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits' can offer motivating but not overpowering background music, aligning with this vibe as well. \n\nHowever, the classification of 'The Endorphin Wave' also fits because of the gradual build in intensity implied by the climbing format. The mention of 'sweat' in the description and a rhythm max of 30 strokes per minute suggest a building energy level, common in 'The Endorphin Wave.' Given these elements, this secondary vibe fits moderately well for this workout session."
