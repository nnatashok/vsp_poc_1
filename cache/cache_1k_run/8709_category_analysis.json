  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Beginner Flow' explicitly mentions it is a yoga session, as indicated by the phrase 'perfect if you are new to yoga or returning to yoga' in the description. The use of the word 'flow' is often associated with a sequence of yoga poses, reinforcing the yoga classification. Furthermore, the music genre tags 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' and the playlist with relaxed tracks support a yoga environment. The mention of the category 'On The Mat' suggests mat-based exercises, but the primary evidence strongly supports yoga being the focus. The inclusion of stretching as a secondary category is due to its common association with yoga practices, reflecting an element of flexibility training conducted alongside yoga. The score of 0.9 for Yoga reflects the very high confidence due to direct references in the metadata, while Stretching receives a moderate score of 0.4 due to its potential but less explicit relevance."
