  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description explicitly states it's a yoga session, and the category is 'On The Mat.' The image shows the instructor sitting on a mat, which further confirms its necessity. These indicate that a mat is very likely needed for comfort and support during the stretches and restorative poses. Although the context is post-row recovery, a rowing machine is not required for this specific session, as it focuses on yoga."
