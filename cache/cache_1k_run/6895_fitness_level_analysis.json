Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is under 6 minutes long and classified as a warm-up, designed to prepare the user for further exercise rather than exert energy at a high rate. There is a focus on generating power at low rhythms, which is unlikely to be physically demanding. The music genres implied are not indicative of high intensity, further supporting the Light effort difficulty classification.",
