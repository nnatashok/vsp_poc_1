Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of just 5:50 minutes and as a warm-up type, the effort difficulty is primarily classified as Light, aligning with its role in preparing the body with low energy expenditure. However, the focus on 'power generation' hints at some physical engagement, thus moderately aligning with the Moderate category. The short duration and warm-up nature limit the overall effort to a Light classification (0.8 score), with a slight acknowledgment of Moderate effort (0.4 score).",
