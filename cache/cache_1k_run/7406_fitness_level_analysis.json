  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which restricts the Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The 'Climb' format typically involves rhythmic row intervals, suggesting some coordination but still manageable for beginners. The simplicity of rowing movements, reinforced by a beginner-friendly requirement, aligns strongly with Beginner (score: 0.8) and moderately with Intermediate (score: 0.4).",

This setup suggests a low-energy, steady workout suitable for beginners, with a strong alignment towards Light (score: 0.8) while incorporating some mild challenge characteristic of Moderate (score: 0.4) due to the rhythm component.",
