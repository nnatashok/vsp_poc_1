  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which defaults to a Technique Difficulty of either Beginner or Intermediate according to Hydrow-specific rules. The description lacks complex movements and the rhythm format 'Climb' refers to intensity changes rather than technical complexity, indicating simple rowing strokes. Hence, a Beginner level is most appropriate (score: 1.0), with a moderate potential overlap with Intermediate due to variation in rhythm and duration (score: 0.4).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 16 minutes and 22 seconds, coupled with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, suggests a Light effort level is appropriate (score: 0.8). However, interval training at a maximum rhythm of 28 SPAM can pose moderate challenges, slightly differentiating it from very passive activity. This provides some alignment with Moderate effort (score: 0.5).",
