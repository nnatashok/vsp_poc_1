  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is about 21 minutes, which suggests moderate effort expenditure. Exercises such as lunges and push-ups can increase heart rate without high intensity when performed continuously. The use of dynamic movements like up downs adds to the caloric burn, pushing the effort level towards Moderate to Challenging. Pop and global hits may encourage consistent pacing, contributing to a moderate effort requirement.",
