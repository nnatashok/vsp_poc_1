  "categoriesExplanation": "The metadata strongly indicates that the workout is categorized as 'Indoor rowing'. The title, 'All in One Row', clearly suggests a rowing activity. The description confirms intervals are performed, and the workout format is specified as 'Interval', which aligns with typical rowing workouts on ergometers. The mention of a 'warm-up and cool-down' further supports a structured cardiovascular session common in rowing. Additionally, the tags include 'row', reinforcing that this is indeed rowing-focused. The description of a high-intensity level and a 'drive' format implies a robust rowing session rather than low-intensity activities. There is no indication of other fitness modalities being involved, making 'Indoor rowing' the sole suitable category with high confidence."
