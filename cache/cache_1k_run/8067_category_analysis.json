  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 1.0 because the workout title explicitly mentions \"4-Minute Intervals Row,\" clearly indicating that this workout involves rowing. The description further supports this with the reference to rowing with specific stroke rates, an indication of a rowing machine regimen. Given the emphasis on heart rate elevation and intervals, the 'HIIT' category is also relevant with a score of 0.65. The description notes 'two 4-minute intervals,' characteristic of High-Intensity Interval Training, although it is listed under a standard rather than high-intensity level. The workout's intensity level and rhythm align with moderate HIIT sessions, although it's not explicitly stated as 'HIIT,' hence the less than maximum score. The absence of other equipment or practices relevant to other categories justifies their exclusion."
