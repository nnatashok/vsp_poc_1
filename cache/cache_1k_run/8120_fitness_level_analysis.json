  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is rowing-based, adhering to the 'row' classification rule where technique difficulty can typically only be Beginner or Intermediate. The session involves intervals led by an Olympic rower, which may introduce slight coordination demand, thus marginally increasing the complexity beyond a pure beginner level, but not sufficiently to fully justify Intermediate without further evidence of complex movement cues.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The interval format with a duration of 11:21 suggests a moderate level of physical exertion. The 'sweat' workout type indicates a light-to-medium energy expenditure, and the intermediate intensity level (2 out of 3) positions it in the lower to mid-range of effort compared to an intense format. Thus, it primarily aligns with Moderate-level energy demand, with some alignment to Challenging due to the interval nature but tempered by the short duration.",
