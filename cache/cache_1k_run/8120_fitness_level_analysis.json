  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'row', and the Technique Difficulty can primarily be classified between Beginner and Intermediate. The use of 'Focused Intervals' suggests some degree of rhythm change and mental focus, indicating a slight elevation in technique. However, rowing itself remains primarily a straightforward endurance exercise, aligning with Beginner to Intermediate level requirements. The absence of any specific equipment or advanced maneuvers supports this classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of approximately 11 minutes and is rated at intensity level 2 out of 3. Given it is an interval workout, this suggests an elevated heart rate is maintained, with moderate energy expenditure. The shift in rhythm and 'sweat' categorization align with moderate effort, but the short duration limits it from being truly challenging. Thus, it aligns strongly with a Moderate effort level, with some overlap into Challenging for less fit individuals.",
