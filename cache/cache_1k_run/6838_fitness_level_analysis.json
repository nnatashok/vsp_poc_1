  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically implies a simple technique difficulty level. The description suggests making small adjustments to the stroke, which might introduce minor coordination challenges, thus slightly aligning it with the 'Intermediate' level. However, since the User Fitness Level Requirement is 'Beginner', the technique is straightforward enough for individuals with minimal rowing experience. Therefore, the strongest alignment is with 'Beginner'.",
