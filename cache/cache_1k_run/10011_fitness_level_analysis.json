  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of approximately 30 minutes and a circuit format, this workout involves sustained effort and high-intensity intervals with dumbbells and rowing. The inclusion of whole-body exercises and minimal rest typically elevates the effort level, aligning it with a Challenging rating. The use of high rhythm (28) contributes to potentially high cardiovascular demand, hinting at aspects of Extreme effort, but overall, it remains primarily Challenging for deconditioned users.",
