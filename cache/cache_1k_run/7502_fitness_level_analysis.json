  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty rates as light to moderate due to the workout being a Pilates session focused on core and hips, which tends to be more about control and endurance than high energy expenditure. The 20-minute duration and absence of equipment contribute to this classification, supporting a less intense level in this mat-based format.",
