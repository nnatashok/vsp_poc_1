  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video, 'Endurance Intervals Row,' incorporates elements of a structured interval format with an emphasis on building confidence and endurance. This aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe (score: 0.7), characterized by repetitive endurance training, especially the rowing focus and the workout's 15-minute duration.\n\nThe inclusion of rock and global hits music with energetic songs like 'Believer' by Imagine Dragons suggests a motivational and elevated energy environment, aligning it with 'The Endorphin Wave' (score: 0.65), where feel-good movement and steady builds are emphasized.\n\nWith a medium intensity level and language like 'sweat' and 'build confidence,' there are elements present that could fit 'The Warrior Workout' vibe (score: 0.6), which captures the heart-pounding exertion common in interval training, although the intensity is moderate.\n\nThe vibe 'The Groove Session' was considered due to the music, but the focus on endurance and intervals suggests a more structured experience."
