  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Hip-Opening Flow.' The term 'flow' is often associated with yoga or similar practices, which typically require a mat. This is further supported by the metadata category 'On The Mat,standard,on-the-mat,' explicitly mentioning 'mat.' The image shows participants standing on mats, confirming their necessity. Thus, there is very high confidence (0.9) that a mat is needed for this workout. No other equipment is indicated through either the description or the visual evidence."
