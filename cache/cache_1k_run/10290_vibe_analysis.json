  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'technical cool-down' focusing on maintaining a 'flat wrist,' which strongly suggests 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe, as it emphasizes technique and skill-building. The specific mention of 'technique' in the description aligns well with this categorization, supporting a score of 0.8. \n\nMoreover, since it's a cool-down session, it also fits the 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which involves low-stress, total-body refresh activities typical of cool-down phases. The overall nature of the cool-down aligns with being gentle and restorative, justifying a score of 0.6 here. \n\nThe dance and global hits music stations played add an element of casual, steady rhythm without impacting the primary technical focus of the workout."
