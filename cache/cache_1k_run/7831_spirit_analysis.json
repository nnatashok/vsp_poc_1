  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is best classified under 'High-Energy & Intense' due to phrases like 'elevate your heart rate' and 'get sweaty,' which indicate vigorous activity. The use of a max rhythm of 28 and the categorization under 'sweat' further support this spirit, earning it a strong score of 0.8.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant as the workout involves 'intervals shifting in rhythm.' The specified music selections from dance and global hits, as well as the workout description, suggest a rhythmic component, earning it a moderate score of 0.6.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is applicable due to the visible rowing on a river setting in the image. This natural environment aspect contributes to a spirit score of 0.7. Although the workout's focus is not exclusively on exploration or nature, the outdoor context provides a meaningful component for this classification. The confidence level is quite high due to explicit indicators from both the description and visual data."
