  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Meditative Grind' due to its focus on rowing at various rhythms ('technique row'), which suggests a repetitive and endurance-based effort. The inclusion of a 'dance playlist' featuring upbeat pop songs like 'Shut Up And Dance' and 'Higher Love' aligns with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse,' as it implies a strong, beat-driven energy accompanying the rowing, adding a layer of fluid and music-infused movement. The intensity level being 2 out of 3 indicates a significant but manageable challenge, supporting both vibes. The 'standard,row' category and the interval format further reinforce the meditative repetition of rowing. The vibes are chosen with high confidence due to the clear indicators in the description and music choice, with a slight acknowledgement that the presence of dance music slightly favors a rhythmic interpretation."
