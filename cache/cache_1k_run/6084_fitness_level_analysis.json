  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row' and the title implies a focus on endurance with a moderate rhythm of 26, which suggests a relatively straightforward rowing cadence without complex movements. The 'breathe' workout type and 'standard' category indicate basic rowing exercises. Based on the metadata, the technique is likely beginner-friendly with a moderate alignment for intermediate skills due to the pyramid format, which may introduce some complexity in maintaining effort over varied intervals. Thus, Beginner has a strong alignment while Intermediate has moderate alignment.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 21-minute duration of the workout combined with a 'pop pyramid' structure and a max rhythm of 26 indicates a light to moderate cardiovascular effort. The 'breathe' category and a stated workout intensity of 1 out of 3 suggest a moderate effort requirement, suitable for beginners who might find the interval structure somewhat challenging. Therefore, Moderate effort aligns strongly, while Challenging aligns weakly, reflecting the endurance-building nature of the workout.",
