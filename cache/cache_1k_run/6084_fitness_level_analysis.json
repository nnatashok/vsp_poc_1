  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Pop Pyramid Row' is categorized under 'row' which typically means the technique difficulty is either Beginner or Intermediate. Given the workout intensity is marked as 1 out of 3 and considering it's a rowing workout focusing more on endurance with intervals, the movements are likely straightforward and require minimal technical skills. The involvement of a standard 'breathe' format with an emphasis on building endurance aligns more with beginner-friendly technical cues. Therefore, there is a strong alignment with the Beginner level and some partial alignment with Intermediate due to potential nuances in pacing and rhythm.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 21-minute duration, combined with intervals, suggests a low to moderate exercise intensity. The workout intensity level of 1 out of 3 indicates it is relatively light in terms of physical demand, suitable for building endurance in beginners. The use of pop music genres also aligns with a more approachable tempo, supporting the categorization as Light to Moderate effort difficulty. The score reflects this mixture of endurance building with a primary lean towards the light side due to the low intensity rating.",
