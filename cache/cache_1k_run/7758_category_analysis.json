  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Endurance Intervals Row', which explicitly indicates a rowing workout. The description mentions '2-minute climbing intervals', and 'max rhythm: 28', typical of an indoor rowing session. The category metadata lists 'row', which further confirms this. The music playlist offering rock and global hits complements a dynamic and rhythmic workout, supporting the interval training style typical for rowing. The workout duration of approximately 16 minutes suggests a relatively short, intense session aligning with an interval format. The equipment is unspecified, reinforcing the rowing focus as it likely centers around the rowing machine itself. Given the strong thematic and format indicators, 'Indoor rowing' is the most fitting category with extremely high confidence."
