  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'Drive' under Hydrow's system, which specifies that the Technique Difficulty should be classified as Advanced due to the specific rhythms and focus on proper form emphasized in 'Drive'. However, since 'row' category is a primary indicator, the Technique Difficulty can only be Beginner or Intermediate. Given the focus on varying rhythms and proper form emphasized by the instructor, and the advanced User Fitness Level Requirement, an Intermediate categorization fits better with these constraints.",
