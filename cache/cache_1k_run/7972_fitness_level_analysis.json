  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is listed as 'Drive', which generally implies a higher complexity due to the intense and precise nature of rowing in this format. However, since the workout category includes 'row', the technique difficulty is limited to either Beginner or Intermediate. This, along with the use of intervals, suggests some technical coordination, leading to a 0.8 score for Beginner and 0.6 for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 16 minutes and 23 seconds, combined with intervals at varying rhythms and the stated maximum rhythm of 30, contributes to significant energy expenditure. The workout intensity is at the maximum level, 3 out of 3, suggestive of a physically demanding session. These factors align primarily with a Challenging effort level, scoring 0.8, while the top intensity contributes to a moderate alignment with Extreme, scoring 0.6.",
