  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, identified as 'Solid Technique Row,' is categorized under 'Breathe, Standard, Row' with a focus on prioritizing 'perfect form.' This indicates an emphasis on rowing fundamentals, which typically aligns with a Beginner to Intermediate technique difficulty level, especially given the 'breathe' workout type which is usually not highly technical. The Beginner rating is supported by the explicit User Fitness Level Requirement. However, some Intermediate elements might be implied due to the coaching focus on form, as such I assign Beginner 0.8 and Intermediate 0.4.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity level is 1 out of 3, suggesting a Light effort requirement. The description indicates a technique-oriented focus, rather than high energy expenditure, making it suitable for beginners. The duration of 31 minutes and the fact that it involves intervals suggests a slightly higher effort than very light activities; thus, while mostly Light, there is a slight Moderate component, leading to a Light 0.9 and Moderate 0.4 assignment.",
