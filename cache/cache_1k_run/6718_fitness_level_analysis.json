Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is just over 21 minutes, which is relatively short, and being labeled as 'beginner-friendly' suggests low-intensity, gentle practice is the focus. The use of 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' music genres supports a relaxed atmosphere, indicative of low energy expenditure typical of light effort difficulty. While yoga itself can be moderately challenging in terms of holding poses, the overall tone and labelling suggest a more light to moderate physical demand for less fit users.",
