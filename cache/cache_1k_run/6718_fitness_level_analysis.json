  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as 'Beginner Yoga Flow' and explicitly described as beginner-friendly. Yoga poses typically range from simple to moderately complex in terms of technique, placing this in the Beginner category with a strong alignment. However, some yoga flows may include poses that require more than basic coordination or flexibility, warranting consideration for Intermediate. The lack of complex equipment or advanced poses further supports this classification.",
