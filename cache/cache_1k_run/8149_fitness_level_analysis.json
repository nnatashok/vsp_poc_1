  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' is typically recognized for its advanced technique demands due to fast-paced rowing and precise stroke execution. However, the 'row' category constrains the classification to either Beginner or Intermediate. Given the format's high-intensity interval training setup and the 'drive' descriptor, it involves moderately complex rowing techniques better suited to those with some rowing experience, aligning it with Intermediate difficulty (0.7).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features a high-intensity interval training format, which is inherently energy-demanding. The 'ignite your lungs' phrase suggests significant cardiovascular exertion, and the max rhythm is high at 32 strokes per minute, further indicating the intensity. Although shorter in duration (16 minutes), the intensity level of 3 out of 3, along with description cues, supports a Challenging to Extreme effort level.",
