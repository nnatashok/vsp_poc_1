  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Foam Roller for Lower Body + Back' emphasizes mobility and involves using a foam roller to ease tension, which aligns strongly with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This is reinforced by the title and description, which focus on rolling for muscles like glutes and quads, typically associated with relaxation and recovery routines. The use of a foam roller implies a gentle, restorative approach aimed at muscle recovery and stress reduction, justifying a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe environment in the image suggests an outdoor setting, supporting the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Performing the session outdoors, by the water, adds an element of nature and exploration, contributing to its score of 0.7. However, the mobility and restorative focus keeps 'Soothing & Restorative' as the primary spirit. The music, with tracks like 'Younger (Kygo Remix)', also adds a soothing and relaxing ambiance, aligning with the restorative theme.\n\nMore dynamic or intense spirits were excluded due to the overall focus on gentle rolling and the absence of high-energy descriptors."
