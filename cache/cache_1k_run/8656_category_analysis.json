  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout name 'Power Flow' and description clearly indicate a yoga-based session, focusing on 'twisting and strengthening your legs.' The term \"flow\" is commonly associated with yoga sequences that involve smooth transitions between postures, suggesting a dynamic activity typical of Vinyasa or power yoga styles. The mention of 'building heat' aligns with more intense yoga practices that focus on strength and endurance. Additionally, the inclusion of optional yoga blocks reinforces the classification as 'Yoga'. The playlist features chill and acoustic tracks, often used to complement yoga sessions, promoting a calm yet focused atmosphere. This suggests a 'Yoga' session with a score of 0.9 due to the clear emphasis in the metadata. \n\nThe secondary classification as 'Mat' with a score of 0.7 arises because 'On The Mat' is a given category tag, indicating that the exercises are performed on a floor mat and involve movements or sequences typical in the mat category, supporting a lower-intensity, body-focused session."
