  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'row', which limits the Technique Difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate according to rules. The involvement of rhythmic climbing and driving through legs suggests a slightly complex technique, warranting an Intermediate classification. However, the basic rowing motion aligns well with Beginner difficulty. Therefore, scores of 0.7 for Beginner and 0.8 for Intermediate are assigned, with high confidence due to clear rowing-based activity and moderate rhythm involved.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 11 minutes and the workout intensity of 2 out of 3 suggest a workout that is moderately challenging, hence scores of 0.7 for Moderate and 0.6 for Challenging. The rhythmic 26 max cadence and 'sweat' category imply a level of intensity that will require considerable effort, especially for deconditioned users. The narrative of making the workout seem less intense through humor further reinforces the challenging aspect. This assessment is made with moderate to high confidence based on metadata indicators.",
