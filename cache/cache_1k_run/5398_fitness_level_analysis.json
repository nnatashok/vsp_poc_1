  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given that the workout type is 'row', Hydrow-specific rules are applied, and the technique difficulty can only range from Beginner to Intermediate. The workout is described with focus on rhythm and climbing, suggesting a rhythmic and consistent rowing pace. This aligns more with Beginner due to the straightforward nature of rowing, but the mention of 'Drive through your legs' suggests an element of proper technique positioning slightly above very basic rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the category 'sweat' and runs for about 11 minutes with a Rhythm of 26, signifying a quick pace. This, combined with the 'climb' format, indicates a moderately challenging exertion that could be demanding for deconditioned users but is not prolonged enough to be extremely challenging. The intensity level of 2 medium-scale suggests a moderate to challenging effort fitting primarily under Moderate difficulty.",
