  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is designated as a 'row' category, which explicitly indicates that a rowing machine is central to this routine. The workout name 'International Women's Day Row' and detailed description mention 'intervals,' which aligns with rowing sessions typically done on a rowing machine. Additionally, the format type 'Climb' often implies a structured increase in resistance or effort, which is common in rowing workouts. As the category includes 'row' and the format supports this, the confidence level for a rowing machine being required is very high at 1.0."
