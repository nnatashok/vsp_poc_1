  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Ride the Wave Row' is best classified under the 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is suggested by the emphasis on 'rhythm 26' and the interval format supported by pop and global hits, which likely support a music-driven pacing and a coordinated rowing experience. It scores 0.7 as the rhythm is a key feature, but not the sole focus. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is clearly evident in the 'three 3-minute intervals' and the structured format, indicating a methodical approach. Given Mac's background as a former collegiate rower, there is likely an emphasis on technique and progressive training, justifying a score of 0.8. The outdoor & adventure spirit is not applicable as the rowing setting is not specified to be outdoors. Although there are elements of fun and a moderately high intensity level, these details don't strongly indicate a purely high-energy or intense workout, focusing instead on structured training with some rhythm elements. The overall confidence in this classification is 0.78 due to the clear details provided about the workout structure and rhythm focus."
