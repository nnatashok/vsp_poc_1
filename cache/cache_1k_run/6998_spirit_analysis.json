  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is strongly classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 1.0 due to the focus on chest opening and restorative practice, as indicated by the title 'Chest Opening Restore' and the description mentioning a 'restorative practice.' The use of chill, downtempo music further supports this spirit as it promotes relaxation and stress reduction. \n\nAdditionally, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is relevant with a score of 0.8, supported by the imagery of the workout being conducted in a snowy outdoor setting. The beautiful natural environment enhances the adventure aspect, even though the primary focus remains restorative.\n\nOverall, the workout has high confidence for both identified spirits due to clear indicators in the metadata, including the title, description, and imagery. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the lack of intensity or athletic focus."
