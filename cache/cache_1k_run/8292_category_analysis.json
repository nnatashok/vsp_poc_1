  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Welcome to Vancouver Row' and the description talks about rowing through swells, which clearly indicates an 'Indoor rowing' workout. The mention of '1-minute intervals' aligns well with the 'HIIT' (High-Intensity Interval Training) category, as it suggests alternating periods of exercise and rest. The workout format is explicitly stated as HIIT, reinforcing the HIIT categorization. Additionally, the workout intensity level is marked as 3 out of 3, indicating a high-intensity session, which fits the HIIT classification. Despite having the ambience of outdoor rowing, the structure clearly fits an indoor rowing session given the context of the platform. The use of music from Indie Alternative and Global Hits radio stations adds to the motivational aspect often found in HIIT or rowing sessions. No other categories fit given the explicit focus on rowing and high-intensity intervals."
