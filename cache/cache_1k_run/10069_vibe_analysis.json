The use of the term 'feel the burn' and '1-minute intervals' underscores the intense effort required, fitting the 'Warrior Workout' description with a score of 0.8 for a strong match. The second vibe, 'The Competitor', is assigned a score of 0.7 due to the instructor's background and approach, emphasizing competition and empowerment, and appealing to advanced users who likely enjoy pushing their limits. Lastly, 'The Meditative Grind' is considered due to the repetitive nature of rowing and the focus required for interval work, earning a score of 0.4 as a moderate match.
