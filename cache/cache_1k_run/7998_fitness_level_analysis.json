  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a cooldown with a short duration of 5 minutes and 40 seconds, which typically demands low energy expenditure, supporting a Light effort difficulty classification. The description and format indicate a focus on technique rather than intensity or volume, further reinforcing the Light effort classification. Cool down workouts are generally intended to ease the body's transition from activity to rest, confirming the suitability for users with less physical fitness.",
