Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 5-minute duration and nature of a 'cool down' indicate very low physical exertion. The emphasis on 'legs only' with pauses further suggests a reduced pace and low energy demands, aligning primarily with a 'Light' effort level. The slight rhythm may marginally increase the effort to Moderate for more deconditioned users, hence the weak secondary classification.",
