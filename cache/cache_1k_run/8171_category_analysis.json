  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Heart Opening Flow,' is explicitly designed as a yoga practice focusing on opening the chest and shoulders, which aligns closely with the 'Yoga' category. The use of the term 'flow' in both the workout name and description further emphasizes the yoga nature, particularly the Vinyasa or flow-oriented sequences typical in such practices. The mention of yoga blocks\u2014a common aid in yoga classes\u2014reinforces this classification, leading to a high confidence score of 0.9 for 'Yoga.' \n\nAdditionally, the description of the workout as opening the chest and shoulders to release tension indicates that it involves elements of 'Stretching,' typically found in yoga practices designed to improve flexibility. This consideration supports assigning a moderate confidence score of 0.6 to the 'Stretching' category.\n\nOther potential categories such as 'Mat' are less applicable because the exercise's focus is explicitly on a yoga flow rather than general mat exercises. Therefore, they were not included in the final category assignments."
