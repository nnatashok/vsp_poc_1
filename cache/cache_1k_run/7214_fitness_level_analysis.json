  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily based on rowing (category: row), which typically involves the same fundamental movement. Rowing is inherently simple in terms of technique for those previously exposed to the basic rowing motion, aligning with the lower-end of Beginner level. However, some degree of technique refinement to manage varying speeds slightly raises the complexity, contributing to a 0.3 score for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is designed as an interval format, combining endurance (longer intervals) and speed (shorter bursts), over a duration of 31 minutes. The overall intensity is moderately high due to the format and rhythm (max 32), indication of sustained effort. This results in a strong alignment with Moderate and a partial alignment with Challenging due to the combination of sustained and high-intensity intervals, suitable for intermediate users seeking a slightly higher challenge.",
