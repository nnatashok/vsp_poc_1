  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given the category is 'row' and the focus is on intervals, the Technique Difficulty inherently falls into the Beginner to Intermediate range. Rowing involves repetitive motion primarily using leg and back muscles in coordination but is generally straightforward. However, the interval nature may demand some coordination and rhythm management, justifying a higher alignment with Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is over 30 minutes with intervals, which suggests a moderate to high cardiovascular demand due to the sustained exertion and varying rhythms up to a max of 32 strokes per minute. Additionally, being under a 'sweat' category indicates a higher intensity, aligning with both Moderate and Challenging effort levels.",
