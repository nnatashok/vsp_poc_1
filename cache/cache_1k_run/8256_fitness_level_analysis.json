  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout falls under 'Drive', which Hydrow rules dictate as requiring high technique due to its intense nature. While rowing is inherently simpler, the Drive category emphasizes technical execution and synchronization at high rates, particularly with a max rhythm of 34, indicating a more complex execution requiring good form and understanding. As stated, no modifications are indicated for simpler movement varieties, thus confirming its Advanced rating with high confidence.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout markedly points to an intensity level 3 out of 3, supported by a 46-minute duration and HIIT nature. The emphasis on sprint and max effort, particularly with short intervals, suggests a high energy expenditure typical of challenging levels, bolstered further by potential extremes for highly deconditioned users. The music choice and lack of listed rest periods also suggest a consistent, intense session. Given the contextual evidence, the workout is challenging to extreme for less fit individuals, with strong confidence.",
