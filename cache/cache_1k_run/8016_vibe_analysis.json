  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Meditative Grind' fits well due to the interval format, which suggests repetitive and focused effort. The duration of 21 minutes with a medium intensity (2 out of 3) supports a steady, continuous workout, aligning well with this vibe, resulting in a confident score of 0.7.\n\n'\\\"The Nightclub Workout\\\" vibe is also relevant. The music playlist includes upbeat pop and global hits, like 'Get The Party Started' and 'Low', which suggests an energetic and celebratory feel to the workout. The title 'Celebration Row' reinforces this impression, warranting a score of 0.6.\n\nWhile both vibes are applicable, the lack of specific rhythm-dependent or dance-based cues reduces the confidence in assigning 'The Nightclub Workout' exclusively. The absence of highly competitive elements rules out 'The Competitor.' The combination of music and structure supports a blend of meditative repetition and energetic music-driven movement."
