  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe 'The Reboot Workout' is strongly represented, as the workout is a cool down aimed at physical and mental recovery, as suggested by the name 'After the Finish Line Cool-Down' and the description. The workout is short, steady-paced, and reflects a calming and refreshing experience, supporting a high score of 0.9. \n\nThe secondary vibe 'The Meditative Grind' is somewhat applicable due to the emphasis on maintaining a steady pace and reflection, which aligns with repetitive and focused activities typical of this category. However, because the primary focus is on recovery rather than endurance, it is assigned a moderate score of 0.6. \n\nOther vibes like 'The Zen Flow' could also fit, but given the music influences and workout type, these were less relevant."
