  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Instructional: Ratio at Low Rhythms' is primarily characterized by a **Structured & Disciplined** spirit. This is evident from the focus on technique and precision, as suggested by terms like 'instructional,' 'ratio,' and 'technique,' and the emphasis on maintaining low rhythms. The structured nature of the warm-up format further implies methodical and disciplined training (score: 0.9).\n\nThe reference to 'rhythm' in the title and description also suggests a **Flow & Rhythm** spirit, as the workout connects rhythm with rowing technique, indicating emphasis on smooth and coordinated movements (score: 0.6).\n\nDespite the indoor rowing machine setup, the image suggests an outdoor setting, introducing possible **Outdoor & Adventure** elements. Although this is less explicit in the metadata, the visual setting in an open air environment grants mild alignment with this spirit (score: 0.5)."
