  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'Drive' and category 'row' suggest rowing-based exercises, which typically fall under Beginner or Intermediate technique. The use of a 'HIIT' format indicates a more complex coordination of high-intensity intervals, suggesting Intermediate level. However, the rowing modality keeps the complexity from reaching Advanced levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 21-minute duration at a high-intensity level 3 out of 3, combined with the HIIT format, indicates a physically demanding workout. Short, intense intervals with max rhythms of 32 reinforce a high energy expenditure. Thus, the effort is between Challenging and Extreme, optimally falling towards the higher end due to the 'drive' categorization.",
