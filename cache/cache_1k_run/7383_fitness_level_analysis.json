  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'drive' as part of its type, which suggests a higher technical demand typical of rowing workouts that require good form and coordination. However, since it's a rowing exercise ('row' category), the maximum possible classification under Hydrow's guidelines is Intermediate. The mentions of 'Max Interval' and 'Sprint' indicate advanced techniques, but within the realm of rowing, this complexity aligns more strongly with 'Intermediate'.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is brief at just over 11 minutes, but its HIIT format with intervals of max intensity rowing and a stated intensity level of 3 out of 3 imply significant physical demand. Interval training inherently requires bursts of near maximal effort which supports the 'Challenging' classification. The use of terms like 'max pace' and the specific focus on high intensity intervals further indicates that the energy expenditure is quite high, bordering on 'Extreme', but short duration slightly moderates this.",
