  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Consistent Effort Row' is mainly characterized by a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, as indicated by the emphasis on 'shifting in rhythm' and the inclusion of music-driven pacing with playlists like Indie Alternative and Global Hits. This suggests a focus on harmony and smooth movement, earning a score of 0.75.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also strongly present due to the '4 sets of 5-minute intervals' and 'endurance building', pointing to a methodical and progressive training approach. This structured intensity is consistent with a score of 0.65.\n\nFinally, given the clear outdoor setting on a river, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' category is highly fitting, with the environment adding an adventurous element to the workout, justifying a score of 0.8."
