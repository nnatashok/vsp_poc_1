  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Upper Body Strength with Long Resistance Band,' emphasizes building strength and proper posture, suggesting a methodical approach aligning with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The mention of 'corrective movements' indicates a focus on precision, further supporting this classification. The score of 0.7 reflects the strong match with this spirit due to these structured elements.\n\nThe image and category 'On The Mat' in an outdoor setting contribute to the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The natural backdrop enhances the adventure aspect, despite the indoor-style exercise format, leading to a score of 0.6. \n\nMusic genres like Indie Alternative and Global Hits add a creative element to the workout but do not significantly alter the spirit evaluation towards Flow or High-Energy categories. Overall, the structured nature and outdoor setting dominate the workout's spirit."
