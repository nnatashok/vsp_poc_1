  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 15 minutes long with a focus on core strength through Pilates, typically low-impact but potentially challenging due to the engagement of specific muscle groups. Pilates often requires maintaining muscle engagement and balance, which can be moderately effortful for deconditioned users (0.65). However, the short duration and Pilates nature, known for being adaptable, align with lighter effort levels suitable for Beginners (0.45). The medium intensity music suggests a moderate pace without high energy intensity, further supporting the Moderate classification.",
