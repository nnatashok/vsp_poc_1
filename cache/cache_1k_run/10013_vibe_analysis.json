  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Bodyweight Circuit' exhibits strong elements of 'The Disciplined Grind' vibe, scoring 0.8. The use of a circuit format and AMRAP (as many rounds as possible) suggests a focus on endurance and repetition without distraction, typical of disciplined execution. The duration (21:31 minutes) supports a sustained effort, aligning with the disciplined nature.\n\nThe vibe 'The Endorphin Wave' is also present, scoring 0.6. The continuous nature of AMRAP circuits and potential for a gradual energy build matches the steady and feel-good experience often found in Endorphin Wave workouts. The presence of upbeat music stations like Global Hits contributes to this energetic vibe.\n\nFinally, 'The Foundation Builder' scores 0.5, as the workout being bodyweight and suitable for all levels indicates a focus on strengthening fundamentals, enhancing overall fitness without specialized equipment. \n\nUncertainty exists due to lack of explicit music genre specifics and instructor guidance."
