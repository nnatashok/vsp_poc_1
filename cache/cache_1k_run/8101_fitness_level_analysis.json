  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Drive' workout type typically involves advanced technique as per Hydrow's classification guidelines. The presence of rhythm changes and a high-intensity rating (3 out of 3) further supports the advance technique difficulty, requiring substantial rowing technique refinement and coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with 15, 30, and 60-second intervals. The max rhythm of 34 suggests a demanding pace, while the short duration (11 minutes and 28 seconds) offers less time for recovery. The music choice, featuring The Prodigy tracks known for energetic and fast beats, hints at a vigorous effort level. Thus, it's most suitable for users who are accustomed to handling moderate to challenging levels of exertion.",
