  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' which defaults technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. Given the focus on maintaining rhythm during intervals, this could slightly push towards Intermediate due to the control and consistent pacing required. However, the low intensity level (1 out of 3) and clear indication that it's a beginner-friendly workout suggest that it aligns strongly with Beginner and moderately with Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is under 17 minutes, and the intensity level is marked as 1 out of 3, suggesting low intensity. Although there are intervals, the set maximum rhythm of 26 is not excessively demanding for most users, fitting a Low-to-Moderate energy expenditure. Therefore, the workout aligns strongly with Light effort difficulty and somewhat with Moderate, considering the intermittent nature of interval training.",
