  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout falls under the 'row' category, which means the Technique Difficulty can be either Beginner or Intermediate. The description mentions establishing a sprint pace with varying rhythms, implying some coordination and proper rowing form is needed, supporting an Intermediate level. However, the absence of complex movements or specific technique challenges suggests a strong alignment with the Beginner level, due to the general simplicity of rowing. Hence, both Beginner and Intermediate are applicable, with a stronger inclination towards Beginner.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 11 minutes long, focusing on power with a max rhythm of 28, indicative of moderate intensity due to the short duration yet power emphasis. The workout type 'sweat' and intensity level 2 out of 3, along with the mention of pace establishment, suggest it is physically demanding for novice rowers, aligning it with Moderate effort. However, the power element and potential fatigue from rowing at high rhythm introduce elements of challenge, aligning it partly with the Challenging level.",
