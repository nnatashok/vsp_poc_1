  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'cool down' session, inherently involving low energy expenditure. With a brief duration of 5 minutes and 48 seconds, and a 'technique' focus, effort requirements are minimal, leading to a solid Light effort classification with high confidence. The session is designed to check form rather than push physical limits, aligning strongly with the Light level.",
