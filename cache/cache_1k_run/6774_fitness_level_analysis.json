Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's short duration of under 6 minutes and its classification as a 'cool down' suggest a very low physical demand. The focus on form rather than intensity or continuous movement, combined with a slow max rhythm, reinforces the light effort level. There is no indication of high intensity or challenging energy expenditure, making it suitable for even the least conditioned users.",
