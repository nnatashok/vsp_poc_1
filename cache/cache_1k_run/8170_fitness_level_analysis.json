  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under the 'row' category, which per Hydrow\u2019s rule limits the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. The activity predominantly involves rhythmic rowing, with a max rhythm of 26, which suggests that coordination required stays within beginner to intermediate demands. Description mentions 'Gradually bring up your rhythm and intensity,' indicating this is likely accessible to beginners while offering some adaptiveness in intensity.",
