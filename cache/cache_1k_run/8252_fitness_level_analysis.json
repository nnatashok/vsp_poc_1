  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which by platform rules constrains Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The description emphasizes mental reflection with low-intensity rowing, indicating simple rowing technique. Since it falls under the 'breathe' category with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, the Beginner level is more strongly aligned.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 21 minutes and an intensity level of 1 out of 3, the workout is likely to be light, more so because of its 'breathe' category which suggests a relaxing pace. The short bursts in a 3', 2', 1' pyramid format might add slight effort, suggesting some moderate aspects for users with very low stamina, but overall these are consistent with a Light level effort.",
