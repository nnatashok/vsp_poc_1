  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is structured as a HIIT session broken into three 10-minute high-intensity intervals with a max rhythm of 32. As a category 3 out of 3 intensity, this suggests a demanding session, but given its short duration, it remains more accessible to less fit users at a 'challenging' level but can verge on 'extreme' especially when considering users in poor fitness.",
