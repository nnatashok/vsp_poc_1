  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's title 'Pitter Patter Row' and the category 'row' explicitly indicate rowing activity. The description mentions rowing in Newport, CA, and an interval format with rhythm shifts supports the rowing activity. With the workout type labeled as 'breathe' and 'standard', the focus is likely on controlled breathing and rhythm, typically associated with rowing workouts. Therefore, a rowing machine is required, earning a very high confidence score of 1.0."
