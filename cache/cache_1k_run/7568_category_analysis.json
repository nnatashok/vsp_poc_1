  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly indicated as a rowing session with a focus on power and rhythm. The name 'Club 18 Row' and the terms 'Max rhythm: 18' and 'Format: Power' in the description strongly suggest an indoor rowing workout, where participants maintain a steady stroke rate.\n\nThe 'Workout Type' being 'sweat', combined with the genre of music playing (rock and global hits), aligns with a moderately intense cardio session, typical in rowing. The duration of 21 minutes and 29 seconds also fits a typical short to mid-length rowing workout.\n\nAlthough the workout is tagged under 'sweat' and 'standard', these terms do not directly correspond to another category such as HIIT or Mat, but they describe the nature of the workout experience, which supports the classification as an indoor rowing exercise. This is why the 'Indoor Rowing' category is assigned with a high score of 0.9, reflecting its centrality to the workout, and the overall confidence in this categorization is very high at 0.95."
