  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short, under 6-minute session classified as 'warm-up'. Describing it as 'instructional' with a focus on core engagement suggests a low-intensity activity suitable particularly for warming up rather than exerting a high effort level. Short duration and the purpose minimize the physical demand, aligning it very strongly with a Light effort difficulty.",
