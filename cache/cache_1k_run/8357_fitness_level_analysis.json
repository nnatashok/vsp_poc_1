  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a brief 5-minute warm-up session, focusing on core engagement with rowing. As a warm-up, it's designed to lightly prepare the body with low intensity, evidenced by the short duration and categorization. Thus, it aligns strongly with a 'Light' effort difficulty, though moderate energy exertion is expected from core-specific focus, contributing to a minor moderate effort attribution.",
