  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 5 minutes and 40 seconds, indicating a brief session suitable for low-energy expenditure. Pilates, especially in a quick session like this, tends to focus on muscle engagement over cardio intensity, further supporting a 'Light' classification. The session's brief nature could be slightly challenging for those very unfit, hence the 'Moderate' score, but is largely light due to its format and duration.",
