  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which indicates that a rowing machine is likely necessary. The description mentions reinforcing 'core engagement and the hip pivot each stroke,' which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the presence of terms like 'stroke' and 'bow' further emphasize rowing, aligning with the rowing equipment needed. Image analysis also depicts rowing equipment, confirming its requirement. Thus, I'm very confident that a rowing machine is essential for this workout, with a confidence score of 0.9."
