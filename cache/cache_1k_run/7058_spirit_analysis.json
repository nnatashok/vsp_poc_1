  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Long Beach Challenge Row' displays a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to several key factors. The description emphasizes hitting 'your lowest split' amid a 'power' format, indicative of an effort to maximize physical output. It is further enhanced by the workout's intensity level of 3 out of 3, and the dance and global hits music playing, which likely contribute to a fast-paced, energetic session. These factors combined assign a strong score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also evident as the workout is conducted outdoors on water, which is visually confirmed by the image and aligns well with the name 'Long Beach'. This natural setting enhances the adventure and exploration aspect, justifying a score of 0.85.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Sport & Agility' were not as strongly represented due to the primary focus on intensity and the outdoors, making them less significant in this context."
