  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout title, 'Hip-Opening Align,' and the description emphasize a focus on opening the hips, which usually involves flexibility exercises that align well with 'Stretching.' The mention of 'align focused' further supports the idea of a structured stretching or alignment routine. The 'On The Mat' tag is interpreted as exercises typically done on a mat, supporting the 'Mat' category designation, albeit with a lower score due to the specific focus on hip opening rather than general floor exercises. The music genre's soothing nature (Chill low, Cool/Downtempo) also suggests a routine that is not intense, aligning with stretching activities. The absence of explicit strength, cardio, or equipment-based indicators excludes categories like 'Body weight,' 'Indoor rowing,' or 'Weight workout.' The confidence is moderate to high due to clear but not overwhelming evidence pointing toward stretching and mat-based exercises."
