  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Watts + Power Row' primarily embodies 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its focus on establishing power at lower rhythms and the nature of rowing, which often involves repetitive motion. The interval format adds a rhythm that can encourage a meditative state, with a score of 0.7 for this vibe. \n\nAdditionally, the music playlist featuring mid-tempo pop and global hits, combined with a moderate intensity level, suggests a feel-good, steady build of energy typically associated with 'The Endorphin Wave', warranting a 0.6 score for its energizing quality. \n\nThe absence of highly energetic or aggressive descriptors and the choice of familiar, uplifting songs exclude vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.' The analysis is fairly confident with a score of 0.75 due to clear indications of rhythm and endurance focus."
