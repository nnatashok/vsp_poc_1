  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which limits the Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The use of 'standard' and 'sweat' categories indicates a more straightforward rowing session without complex maneuvers. The description suggests a focus on rhythm increase, which may introduce a slight increase in coordination requirement, suggesting a stronger Beginner alignment with some Intermediate elements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves 4-minute intervals with increasing rhythm, indicating a moderately high level of effort due to sustained exertion. Aisyah's background and the 'sweat' label suggest a focus on cardiovascular endurance. The maximum rhythm and climbing format are aligned with moderate to challenging effort, appropriate for building endurance. Thus, there is moderate to strong alignment with both Moderate and Challenging levels.",
