  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Power HIIT Row' workout is characterized by high intensity and dynamic intervals, which strongly aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe. The '90\" and 60\" high intensity intervals' and '15\" sprints' suggest a sweat-dripping, heart-pounding experience typical of a Warrior Workout. The vigorous HIIT format and max rhythm of 32 support a high energy vibe, earning a score of 0.9 for 'The Warrior Workout'.\n\nThe use of music genres like 'Dance High' and 'Global Hits', combined with songs such as 'Higher Love' and 'Don't Stop Movin'', suggests elements of 'The Nightclub Workout'. These tracks create a euphoric, upbeat atmosphere, justifying a score of 0.6.\n\nThe competitive nature implied by the 'intensity level 3 out of 3' and the challenging interval structure aligns moderately with 'The Competitor' vibe, indicating gamified or goal-driven training. This earns it a score of 0.5."
