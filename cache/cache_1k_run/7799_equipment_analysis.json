  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is classified under the category 'row,' and the description explicitly mentions rowing at specific rhythms. This indicates a strong focus on rowing exercises. The mention of 'rhythms 22 and 24' and 'practice rowing with your eyes closed' further emphasizes the use of a rowing machine. Additionally, the image shows a person engaged in rowing activity on water, reinforcing the connection to rowing equipment. Consequently, the 'Rowing machine' is identified as necessary with high confidence (0.9). No other equipment is specified or implied in the metadata."
