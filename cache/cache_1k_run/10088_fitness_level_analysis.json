  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is part of the 'row' category, which typically indicates lower technical complexity. The description does not suggest complex movements that require advanced skill, aligning with Beginner to Intermediate levels. With the user fitness level requirement being Intermediate, some coordination may be involved, but the rowing component supports the Beginner classification.",

The workout type is 'sweat', indicating higher energy expenditure, and the intensity level is 2 out of 3, suggesting a challenging exertion level for less fit users. Thus, it aligns with both Moderately and Challenging levels.",
