  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Back Bends Align\" involves warming up gently and practicing backbends, which aligns closely with a \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit. The use of terms like 'gently' and the mention of a warm-up suggest a focus on gradual, healing, and relaxing movements, supported by the chill and downtempo music selection. This spirit is assigned a high confidence score of 0.8 as the workout is likely calming and recovery-focused.\n\nThe \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit receives a moderate score of 0.6. The playlist includes tracks with smooth, electronic vibes like those from R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL and Kygo, enhancing the flow and mind-body connection aspect of the workout. While there is less emphasis on continuous movement patterns, the music-driven pace adds to this categorization.\n\nOther spirits, such as \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Structured & Disciplined,\" are not suitable due to the gentle, relaxing nature of the session, which lacks high intensity or strict structure."
