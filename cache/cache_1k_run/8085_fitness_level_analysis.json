  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The brief duration of 5 minutes and 42 seconds and categorization as a 'cool down' indicate a very light physical demand. The primary focus seems to be on relaxation and reflection rather than intense physical output. With 'steady' rhythm and no instructor cues suggesting higher intensity, the energy expenditure is minimal, suitable for complete beginners, justifying a high alignment with the 'Light' level.",
