  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is just over 5 minutes, fitting within the typical timeframe for cool-down activities which generally seek to gradually reduce activity intensity. The nature of a 'cool down' dictates minimal physical exertion, aligning with a 'Light' effort difficulty. The metadata lacks any intensity cues suggesting increased effort, further reinforcing this classification.",
