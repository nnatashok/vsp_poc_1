  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Technique Cool-Down' is primarily focused on reinforcing rowing technique, as indicated by the terms 'technique' and 'each stroke' in the description, suggesting an emphasis on proper rowing form. This points strongly towards an 'Indoor rowing' category, as it directly pertains to rowing machine use, giving it a high score of 0.9. The mention of 'cool down' and 'technique focused cool-down' may suggest elements of stretching or slow-paced exercises to aid recovery and flexibility, justifying a secondary 'Stretching' category with a lower score of 0.3, due to the less prominent role. The music and playlist details support a mild, relaxed workout environment, further affirming the cool-down nature but do not play a significant role in the classification due to the focus being on technique rather than intensity or endurance. The absence of detailed intensity cues or other activity types solidifies the classification confidence."
