Although the session occurs on a rower, usage specificity like HIIT intervals elevate coordination demands. However, it does not reach Advanced due to rowing's inherent simplicity compared to other exercises.",

The 16-minute duration is intense, especially for deconditioned users, warranting Challenging classification (0.7), plus some Extreme considerations (0.6) due to its continuous high-level exertion phases.",
