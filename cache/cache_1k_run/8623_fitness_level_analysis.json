  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short, 5-minute session, which limits the potential for a high energy expenditure. Plank exercises, depending on the intensity and pace, can provide a moderate challenge, especially for deconditioned users. The upbeat music genre suggests a moderately engaging level, but due to the short duration, the overall effort difficulty is best categorized as Light to Moderate, with a stronger fit to Moderate given the time spent in a core-intensive activity.",
