  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration (5:45) and classification as a 'core burn' session suggest low to moderate intensity. Pilates mat exercises typically involve controlled, slow movements focusing on muscle engagement rather than high calorie burn or cardiovascular intensity, indicating primarily Light effort difficulty. However, core engagement during planks might pose a slight challenge to less fit users, marginally raising the possibility of Moderate effort at 0.3.",
