  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Legs Focused Align' is characterized by a lower-body yoga session, suggested through words like \"stretch out\" and \"yoga\" in the description. This aligns well with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as yoga often focuses on recovery, relaxation, and stress reduction, giving it a strong match score of 0.8.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant due to the nature of yoga, which emphasizes continuous movement patterns and mind-body connection. The chill, downtempo music genre further supports this classification with a score of 0.7, indicating a steady, calm pace that enhances the yoga flow.\n\nGiven the outdoor setting captured in the image, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is moderately applicable. The workout is conducted in a natural outdoor environment, meriting a score of 0.6. While the focus isn't on exploration or environmental challenges, the venue provides a minor element of this spirit. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded as there are no indicators of high intensity, strict training protocols, or sports-specific agility in the metadata."
