  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, classified under the 'row' category, limits the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. Given that the workout involves rhythm climbing, it suggests a degree of coordination that goes slightly beyond absolute basics, aligning more with an Intermediate level. However, rowing remains straightforward in terms of movement patterns, keeping it mostly within the Beginner range. Thus, the technique difficulty leans strongly towards Beginner with a significant component of Intermediate due to the rhythm-based nature of the climbs.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 16 minutes and a maximum rhythm of 26 imply a moderately paced effort, especially as it combines cardio and strength training elements described in the 'sweat' format. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicates it is more demanding than light but still accessible. The inclusion of rhythm climbing adds intensity, making it somewhat challenging, especially for beginners. Overall, the effort difficulty is evaluated as moderate, with a moderate alignment towards challenging due to the required pace and intensity.",
