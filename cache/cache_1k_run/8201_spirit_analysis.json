  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a high score of 0.9, due to the rowing activity being conducted along the shores of the Charles River. The setting in a natural environment is a key indicator for this spirit. Additionally, the workout's nature aligns with exploration and leveraging the river setting.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is also relevant with a score of 0.65. The presence of upbeat music from artists like P!NK and The Weeknd, combined with the 'sweat' category and intensity level 2 out of 3, indicates a focus on pushing physical limits and energizing the participants. The 'climb' format and 30 rhythm further support an intensified workout experience.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' were considered but not selected because the emphasis appeared more on energy and outdoor experience rather than smooth, continuous movements."
