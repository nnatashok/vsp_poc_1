Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves two six-minute AMRAP blocks (As Many Rounds As Possible) which can induce a significant cardiovascular and muscular endurance challenge within a 20-minute window. The exercises themselves are not of high intensity individually, but continuous execution within the AMRAP structure can elevate effort, placing this session at the high end of Moderate to the low end of Challenging levels. This is supported by the 'dynamic' and 'energized' cues in the description.",
