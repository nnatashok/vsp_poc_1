  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout 'Behind the Scenes Row' prominently features rowing, as indicated by the title and category tags such as 'row', aligning it with 'Indoor rowing'. The workout is described as maintaining a 'steady pace', suitable for an indoor rowing format with a max rhythm of 26 strokes per minute, supporting a high confidence score of 0.9 for 'Indoor rowing'. Additionally, the description mentions 'breathe' and 'Workout Type: breathe', suggesting an element of 'Breathing exercises'. Given the lower intensity level of 1 out of 3, 'Breathing exercises' might be a supporting feature, hence it receives a moderate score of 0.6. The workout is not classified under 'Stretching', 'Yoga', or 'Breathe' categories, as there's a specific mention of steady rowing pace, and there's no supporting evidence for these categories beyond focus on breathing."
