Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration of 5 minutes and 43 seconds, combined with a 'cool down' categorization, strongly suggests light energy expenditure. The emphasis on 'low rhythm' rowing aligns with light effort intensity, appropriate for recovery or cooldown phases, rather than an intense workout. There is minimal indicator of high energy demand or intensity, supporting a predominantly 'Light' classification with minimal 'Moderate' aspects due to the rowing setting.",
