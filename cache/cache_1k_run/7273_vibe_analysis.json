  "vibesExplanation": "The title 'Alternating Rhythms Row' and the use of rhythmic interval training suggest a structured yet engaging session, making 'The Meditative Grind' a suitable vibe. This is supported by the workout type 'breathe' and the interval format, indicating a focus on steady pacing and endurance typically associated with rowing, earning a score of 0.7.\n\nThe inclusion of upbeat 90s music with hits like 'Good Vibrations' and 'Play That Funky Music' contributes to a positive atmosphere, which aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe. It suggests an elevated energy and a feel-good experience, meriting a score of 0.6.\n\nThe workout's low intensity (1 out of 3) and category also confirm a more relaxed and consistent effort rather than explosive, high-intensity exertion, ruling out more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout.' The focus on rhythm and music reduces the likelihood of a solemn or introspective vibe, making 'The Endorphin Wave' and 'The Meditative Grind' the most precise fits despite some ambient ambiguity."
