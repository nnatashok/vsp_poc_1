  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', making the use of a rowing machine highly likely. The term 'row' in the category and the workout name 'Club 18 Row' strongly suggest that this is an indoor rowing workout. The description also emphasizes a rhythm-based approach, which is typical for rowing exercises. Although the image features a traditional rowing boat, in the context of a standard workout class, it likely refers to a rowing machine. Therefore, the confidence level for needing a rowing machine is very high at 0.9."
