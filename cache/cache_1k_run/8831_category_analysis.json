  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout 'Squat + Plyometric Circuit' is primarily classified under 'Mat', 'Body weight', and 'Weight workout'. The title indicates a circuit workout with squats and plyometrics, suggesting a versatile routine often performed on a mat. This aligns with metadata tags 'On The Mat' and 'circuit'. The mention of 'dumbbells' in the equipment list and the descriptor 'Total body focus' strongly supports inclusion in 'Weight workout', hence the high score (0.8). The interval format (AMRAP) and plyometric component suggest bodyweight exercises, linking it to 'Body weight' with a moderate score (0.7). High-intensity intervals on Hydrow add versatility but aren't central enough to rate as 'Indoor rowing'. The classification confidently identifies the workout's format and goal, focusing on strength and circuit training on a mat."
