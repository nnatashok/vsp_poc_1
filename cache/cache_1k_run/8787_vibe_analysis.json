  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'High Energy Hybrid Row' is focused on developing endurance through 2-minute intervals followed by intense 60-second 'blasters,' indicating a sustained, feel-good energy typical of 'The Endorphin Wave' (score: 0.7). The use of rowing and endurance-based intervals fits well with 'The Meditative Grind,' reflecting a rhythmic, repetitive nature (score: 0.6). The high intensity level (3 out of 3) and upbeat playlist with songs like 'Believer' by Imagine Dragons introduce elements of adrenaline and challenge, suggesting some characteristics of 'The Adrenaline Rush' (score: 0.4). The interval format and energetic indie alternative and global hits music also support these classifications. Lack of specific music genre limits the intensity classification, but the provided artists do hint at an energizing and motivating workout experience."
