  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Power Pyramid Row' and the category 'row' explicitly indicate that this is a rowing workout. Additionally, the term 'climb in rhythm and intensity' suggests an increase in rowing pace, which is consistent with using a rowing machine. The overall context of the workout, defined as 'sweat' and 'standard', aligns with using a rowing machine for cardiovascular and endurance training. Therefore, the required equipment for this workout is a 'Rowing machine', with very high confidence."
