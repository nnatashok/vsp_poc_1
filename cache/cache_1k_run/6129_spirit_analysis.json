  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's title \"Restorative Yoga\" and description \"Gently move and spend time in each pose\" strongly indicate a relaxing and healing focus, matching the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The score of 0.95 reflects the explicit emphasis on restorative and gentle movement.\n\nThe setting in \"Lucerne, Switzerland\" alongside the depiction of an outdoor environment by the lake suggests a connection with nature. This aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, scoring 0.75 due to the session being conducted outdoors in a scenic location.\n\nThe mentioned music genre \"Chill low, Cool/Downtempo\" supports a calming atmosphere, further reinforcing the Soothing & Restorative spirit. Lack of equipment and a short 16-minute duration also align with a light and restorative workout. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' do not fit due to the gentle, relaxed focus and setting."
