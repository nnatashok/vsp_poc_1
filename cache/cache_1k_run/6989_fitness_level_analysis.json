Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 5 minutes and 53 seconds long, classified as a 'warm-up' with the aim to raise rhythm with controlled technique rather than intense energy output. Music tracks like 'Juice' by Lizzo and 'Sugar' by Maroon 5 support an upbeat but not intense pace. Duration and warm-up nature strongly align with Light effort. Moderate effort is partially considered due to the potential energy needed for controlled rhythm exertion.",
