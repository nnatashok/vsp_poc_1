  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 30 minutes, which is moderate in length. While pilates is generally less intense than high-impact workouts, the whole-body focus suggests a comprehensive session that may involve continuous movement, aligning with a Moderate intensity level. The background music from Hip Hop/R&B Mid and Global Hits might add to the tempo, making it slightly more engaging physically. Given these factors, Moderate fits well, with some aspects potentially Challenging for less fit users.",
