  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as a cool down, with a focus on recovery, aligning well with the vibe of 'The Reboot Workout' (score: 0.8). The short duration of 5 minutes and 47 seconds, along with the emphasis on recovery and post-row snacks, supports a gentle, low-stress experience indicative of a reboot. 'The Comfort Moves' vibe (score: 0.6) is also relevant due to the casual, laid-back nature implied by discussions about favorite snacks and the comforting music choice including 'Love Yourself' and 'All To Myself', which suggest a cozy atmosphere. The soft, relaxed music genres like Country and Global Hits further enhance these vibes. There is no indication of high intensity or strenuous activity, ruling out more intense vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout.' Overall, the metadata strongly points towards a calming and restorative session."
