  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Endurance Row' strongly indicates an 'Indoor rowing' workout. The description includes specific terms such as 'row along,' directly referencing rowing exercises. Additionally, the metadata mentions 'row' as part of the category tags, further affirming its rowing nature. The format described as 'Interval' aligns well with typical rowing workout structures, indicating varying intensities possibly suitable for endurance building, as mentioned. The presence of pop music from well-known artists could be motivational for a rhythmic rowing session. Given the significant emphasis on rowing in both title and description, along with the workout format and music choice, the 'Indoor rowing' category is assigned a score of 0.9, indicating a strong presence and central role in the workout. Other categories like 'HIIT' or 'Body weight' were not considered as there's no mention of multiple exercise types or distinct high-intensity intervals beyond rowing."
