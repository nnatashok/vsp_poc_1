  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which restricts technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. The interval format with varied durations (1', 2', 3', and 4') at a rhythm of 26 suggests some level of mastery is needed to maintain consistency but remains accessible due to straightforward rowing movements. The association with Mike, a seasoned rower, highlights the importance of proper technique, raising the score for Intermediate classification slightly, though not exceeding it.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of 21 minutes of rowing intervals. The intervals increase in duration (up to 4 minutes), allowing enough cumulative exertion to challenge users. The workout's classification as 'sweat' and intensity level 2 of 3 indicate a substantially demanding effort, more than light but not the most extreme, aligning it with moderate to challenging effort levels, supportive for deconditioned users aiming to increase stamina.",
