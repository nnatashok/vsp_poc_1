  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for this workout classifies as both Beginner and Intermediate. Since this is a rowing workout ('row' category), the complexity of movement primarily involves maintaining a consistent rowing form and rhythm. The rhythm of 26 strokes per minute suggests some challenges for coordination, thus giving it an Intermediate alignment, while the overall rowing motion remains a straightforward activity aligning well with the Beginner level. The workout description's emphasis on consistency in standard rowing techniques suggests that form must be adhered to closely, but there is not enough specification indicating advanced techniques.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as Moderate with elements of Challenging due to the interval nature of the workout (1', 2', 3', and 4' increments) and a listed intensity level of 2 out of 3. The duration of approximately 21 minutes with interval training at a steady rhythm requires a considerable energy expenditure. For deconditioned users, maintaining effort across increasing interval lengths can be somewhat demanding, but not to the extent of high-intensity workouts, fitting Moderate best. The Challenging classification is supported by the continuous rowing requirement over time.",
