Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short at 20 minutes and 45 seconds, and the use of Chill music suggests a slower pace with potentially more controlled movements typical of classic Pilates. Since Pilates doesn't typically require high energy expenditure but instead focuses on control and core engagement, the effort difficulty aligns with Moderate. However, the more relaxed pace implied by music choice supports a partial alignment with a Light level for some less fit users.",
