Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of just over five minutes, this workout is a short cool down session, which is inherently low in intensity. The description and emphasis on proper technique when cycling through drills suggest a focus on form rather than cardiovascular or resistance effort. The very mention of a cool down paired with the max rhythm of 20 confirms that it is a low-intensity workout, suitable for those easing out from previous exertion or for maintaining technique, thereby classifying it as Light effort difficulty.",
