  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout combines a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) segment on the Hydrow, sandwiched between Pilates and yoga segments. The maximum rhythm of 26 during rowing suggests a fairly intense effort. Additionally, the workout intensity level is marked as 3 out of 3, indicating a demanding workout. However, the short total duration (20:51) moderately reduces overall energy expenditure, aligning it primarily with a 'Challenging' effort level for deconditioned users.",
