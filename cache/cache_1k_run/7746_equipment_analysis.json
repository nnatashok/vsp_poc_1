  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout's metadata explicitly categorizes it as a 'row,' indicating a clear focus on rowing activities. The description refers to '5-minute pieces' and a 'final 1-minute effort,' which are typical structures for rowing workouts. Additionally, the term 'drive' used in both the workout type and category further implies a rowing exercise, as this term is often associated with the main power phase in rowing. The visual image provided shows a person using a rowing scull, which strongly corroborates the workout's rowing focus. Collectively, this metadata ensures that a rowing machine is essential for completing this workout, warranting a very high confidence score of 1.0."
