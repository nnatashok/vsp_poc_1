  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video, named 'Relaxed Hands Cool-Down', is categorized under 'Indoor rowing' with high confidence due to several explicit indicators. Firstly, the description explicitly mentions 'row with Aquil', indicating that rowing is the focal activity of the workout. Furthermore, the term 'Steady' format and '20 max rhythm' suggests controlled, sustained rowing typically associated with indoor rowing machines (ergometers). The description's focus on relaxation in the upper body and hands aligns with a low-intensity rowing session common in cool-down exercises after more intense physical activities. The use of music from genres like Dance and Global Hits suggests a background music choice that supports rhythm and flow without being overly invigorating, further aligning with the cool-down rowing activity. Overall, the combination of rowing-specific terminology, alongside the context of a cool-down, supports the primary categorization as 'Indoor rowing'. No other categories such as 'Stretching', 'Meditation', or 'Yoga' apply, as the activity centers on rowing and not stretching or mindfulness practices."
