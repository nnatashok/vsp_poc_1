  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Beginner Hip + Core Pilates\" primarily embodies a \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit due to its Pilates nature, emphasizing smooth movements and coordination, as indicated by the term \"beginner friendly\" and the music choice of R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL, a band known for rhythmic and ambient soundscapes (score: 0.7). The workout also has elements of \"Soothing & Restorative,\" as Pilates often focuses on core and hip stability, aligning with relaxation and stability, though it's conducted at a beginner level, suggesting a gentler approach (score: 0.5). The outdoor setting, evident from the image featuring a historic plaza, brings an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" aspect to the workout, emphasizing nature and exploration (score: 0.6). Overall, the harmonious and beginner-friendly cues support these spirits."
