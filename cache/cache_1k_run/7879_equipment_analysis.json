  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is classified under the category 'row,' indicating a rowing focus for the cool down session. Despite the 'cool down' type, the inclusion of 'row' suggests that a rowing machine is likely necessary to perform this workout effectively. The image accompanying the metadata depicts a person rowing, which further supports the requirement of a rowing machine. The confidence score reflects this strong implication based on the categorical designation and visual evidence."
