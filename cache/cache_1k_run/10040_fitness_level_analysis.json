  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The exercise duration is relatively short at 5 minutes and 44 seconds, and the description focuses on decreasing heart rate, indicating low intensity. As a 'cool down' type, it is inherently designed for recovery and relaxation. This, combined with a relatively low rhythm max of 24 and the setting of 'Classical, Cool/Downtempo' music, suggests minimal physical demand. Therefore, it confidently matches the Light effort difficulty level.",
