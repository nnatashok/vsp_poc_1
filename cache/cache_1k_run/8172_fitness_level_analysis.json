  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'breathe' and 'row', which implies low intensity and a focus on steady sustained movement. Rowing exercises are typically beginner to intermediate in complexity, given their repetitive nature and basic form requirements. With a max rhythm of 28 and a low intensity level, this suggests straightforward rowing technique that aligns with a beginner's ability. Therefore, Beginner level has a high alignment (0.9) with a slight possibility of Intermediate (0.1) if rhythm pacing requires enhanced coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 31 minutes and low (1 out of 3) intensity rating categorize the effort as Low to Moderate. 'Breathe' formats are typically less demanding, focusing on long, steady-state rowing. The workout is designed to maintain a gentle rhythm rather than high-intensity intervals, indicated by the music choices and the theme of 'cruise'. Thus, Light effort (0.75) and some overlap into Moderate effort (0.25) for maintaining duration without high bursts of energy.",
