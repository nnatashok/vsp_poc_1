  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Tampa Intervals Row' is classified as a rowing workout, indicated by the category and title. Based on Hydrow's guidelines, rowing workouts have a technique difficulty range limited to Beginner or Intermediate. The mention of 'Drive through your legs during intervals' signifies a focus on proper rowing form, suggesting a slight complexity but not exceeding Intermediate. Therefore, Beginner is strongly aligned due to the simplicity of the exercise, while Intermediate is partially aligned due to the focus on form.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 21 minutes and 30 seconds, with an interval format and an intensity level indicated as 2 out of 3. These factors suggest a workout that is more intense than light but not excessively demanding. The interval nature increases effort, aligning well with Moderate effort difficulty. The music's mid-intensity supports this classification. A moderate alignment with Challenging is also noted, given the interval feature which may increase cardiovascular demands.",
