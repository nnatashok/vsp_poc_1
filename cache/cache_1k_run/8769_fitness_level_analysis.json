  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under the 'row' category, limiting technique difficulty to a maximum of 'Intermediate'. Given the emphasis on driving through the legs and maintaining rhythm during intervals, the movements require basic coordination and body awareness typical of rowing. Rowing as a movement itself is less complex compared to compound lifts or advanced yoga poses, justifying a strong alignment with 'Beginner' (score: 0.8) and moderate alignment with 'Intermediate' (score: 0.6).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 21 minutes and 30 seconds, which is moderate. Combined with an intensity level of 2 out of 3 and the interval format, this implies moderate to challenging energy expenditure, especially for deconditioned users. The format 'interval' suggests periods of higher intensity, raising the energy demand slightly, warranting a primary classification of 'Moderate' (score: 0.7) and secondary readiness for 'Challenging' (score: 0.5) due to interval training's nature and duration.",
