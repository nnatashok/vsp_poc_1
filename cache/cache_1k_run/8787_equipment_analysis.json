  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata clearly indicates that this workout falls under the 'row' category, suggesting a rowing-focused exercise. The workout name 'High Energy Hybrid Row' further emphasizes this focus on rowing. The format 'Intervals' and high intensity level (3 out of 3) indicate that a rowing machine is necessary to perform the high-intensity intervals effectively. Additionally, the title and description both highlight aspects of rowing, reinforcing the need for a rowing machine. Therefore, a very high confidence score of 0.95 is assigned to the rowing machine being required for this workout."
