  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Pre-HIIT Warm-Up' is classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' (score: 0.75), due to its focus on climbing in rhythm for 30-second intervals. The use of the term 'rhythm' in both the description and the title suggests a key emphasis on smooth, continuous movement patterns. The inclusion of music, specifically from the 'Rock Mid-intensity' and 'Global Hits' radio stations, reinforces this spirit by emphasizing pacing driven by beats.\n\nSecondly, the session is also assigned the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (score: 0.6) since it involves interval training ('Format: Intervals'), which is methodical and follows specific protocols. The duration of this warm-up and the preparatory nature of the workout further suggest a disciplined approach to fitness.\n\nOther potential spirits, such as 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'High-Energy & Intense', were excluded due to the workout's focus on preparation and rhythmic flow rather than recovery or maximum exertion."
