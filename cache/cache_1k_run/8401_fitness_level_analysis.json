  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'row' category, which typically involves basic rowing movements. The keywords 'power and speed' suggest a focus on pacing and rhythm changes, which could elevate it to more than just beginner level. The presence of intervals implies some coordination and understanding of pacing, leaning towards Intermediate. However, due to the simplicity of rowing, Beginner classification aligns closely. Confidence is high given typical rowing simplicity and the mention of intermediate fitness level requirement.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 21 minutes with 'interval' format and a focus on 'power and speed' suggests it goes beyond a Light effort. The 'sweat' and 'standard' categories, combined with an intensity of 2 out of 3, indicate a Moderate to Challenging effort. The interval nature increases overall exertion. Therefore, it fits a strong Moderate to low Challenging effort category for those in poor physical shape.",
