The emphasis is on rhythm control at 22 and 24, which requires basic cadence maintenance without complex form adjustments. Beginner-level classification is strongly supported since effective rowing involves basic techniques manageable by novices. Thus, this aligns with the metadata's claim of Beginner fitness level, conferring a score of 1.0 for Beginner and 0.6 for Intermediate given the potential learning curve for absolute beginners.",

With an intensity level of 1 out of 3, it signifies a lower energy demand suitable for a light workout. However, maintaining a rhythm at 22-24 can still challenge individuals with low endurance, justifying a score of 0.5 for Moderate effort. The structure and duration lean towards being Light given the platform's breath and steady format, suggesting it as approachable for beginners who might still find elements moderately demanding. Hence, it is rated Light with a score of 0.8.",
