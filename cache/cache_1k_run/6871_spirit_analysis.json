  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"Flow & Rhythm\" due to its focus on whole body pilates, which generally emphasizes smooth, continuous movements and coordination. The presence of music from the playlist featuring energetic remixes and global hits supports this classification, as it likely aids the flow and pace of the routine. The score of 0.7 reflects these strong elements of rhythmic and musical integration.\n\n\"Structured & Disciplined\" is also relevant, given the nature of pilates as a methodical practice that typically follows specific protocols and technical precision. The intermediate level described in the workout indicates a level of complexity and structure, earning it a score of 0.6.\n\nOther spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Outdoor & Adventure\" were excluded due to the lack of explicit indicators of high intensity or outdoor elements in the metadata."
