  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Contemplative Cool-Down' and involves a gradual reduction in rhythm, suggesting a calming and reflective experience, which aligns well with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The choice of music, featuring artists like the Grateful Dead, who are known for their mellow and relaxed tunes, further supports this classification. The description includes 'mentally scanning your body,' signifying a focus on mindfulness and intentional movement, also reinforcing 'The Zen Flow' vibe with a strong score of 0.8.\n\n'Cool Down' is explicitly listed as the workout type, which fits 'The Reboot Workout' vibe. It involves a refreshing and gentle conclusion to physical exertion. Given the workout's brief duration of 5 minutes and 45 seconds, it is designed for low stress and body refresh, warranting a score of 0.7 for 'The Reboot Workout'.\n\nThe repetitive nature of rowing and the focus on rhythm fits 'The Meditative Grind.' The phrase 'gradually work your way to lower rhythms' implies a focus on endurance and consistent movement, justifying a score of 0.6. Other potential vibes were excluded due to the emphasis on cooling down and mental calmness rather than intensity."
