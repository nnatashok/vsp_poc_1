  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Climbing Intervals Row' is characterized by its emphasis on rhythm and music, as seen in the description 'Climb in rhythm with Mike and Mac' and the playlist consisting of dance tracks. This suggests a strong alignment with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score 0.8), emphasizing coordination and a music-driven experience.\n\nAdditionally, the image provided shows rowing on a river, which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Despite the focus on music and rhythm, the outdoor setting contributes significant context to categorize it under this spirit (score 0.7).\n\nThe workout features interval training ('four sets of 4-minute intervals') and a mid-intensity level, fitting a variety of training methodologies. However, the structured form of interval training is not as predominant as the rhythmic and outdoor elements, hence 'Structured & Disciplined' is not prioritized.\n\nOverall, the combination of rhythmic focus and outdoor context shape the classification of this workout."
