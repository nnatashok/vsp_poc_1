  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Performance Mindset Row' strongly reflects the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to its 'sweat' type and the use of interval training with varying stroke rates (20, 26, and 28). The use of high-energy songs like 'Natural' by Imagine Dragons further emphasizes an intense, motivational atmosphere. The intensity level being 2 out of 3 supports this classification. Thus, it receives a score of 0.8 for embodying this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the workout is displayed in an outdoor setting, specifically on a river, which clearly embodies the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The environment leverages natural elements and requires adaptability to conditions different from indoor rowing. This spirit receives a score of 0.9 for its strong presence.\n\nWhile there is significant evidence for both these spirits, there are no strong indicators for other spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined,' which rely on smoother transitions or technical focus not prominent in the description."
