  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'drive' type within the 'row' category, usually rated as beginner or intermediate. However, the metadata includes descriptors like \"HIIT Pyramid Row\" and \"high-intensity intervals\" with a max rhythm of 34. The combination of high rhythms and HIIT elements suggests intermediate to advanced technical complexity, given the coordination needed for high-speed rowing. While 'drive' implies a higher technical demand specific to Hydrow, the technique difficulty remains intermediate or slightly advanced within their structure, aligning with the user requirement marked as 'Advanced'.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is notably high for this workout. It includes 'HIIT' and 'drive' types, denoting high-intensity training. The workout duration is over 31 minutes with intense intervals and a rhythm of 34, suggesting robust energy expenditure. These elements imply a strong effort demand, positioned between challenging and extreme due to the enduring high intensity and limited rest typical in HIIT sessions. The platform's intensity level of 3 corroborates this analysis, urging a closer alignment towards a challenging effort level, yet not ruling out some extreme characteristics.",
