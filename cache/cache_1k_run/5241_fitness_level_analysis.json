Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short, 5-minute session, which limits the potential for high energy expenditure. It emphasizes improving posture through mobility exercises, which are usually low-intensity and aimed at flexibility enhancement rather than cardiovascular or strength training. Given the emphasis on stretching and low duration, the effort difficulty aligns strongly with 'Light'. Some very minimal elements might slightly touch moderate effort but are unlikely to exceed it.",
