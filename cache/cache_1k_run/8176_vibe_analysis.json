  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Low Rhythm Row' has a controlled rhythm (18, 22, and 24), characteristic of 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, focusing on repetition and endurance, as indicated by the moderate intensity (1 out of 3) and the description encouraging finding 'power in your legs.' The playlist with artists like Kygo and Ed Sheeran suggests a calming but motivating environment, fitting this vibe with a score of 0.7.\n\nThe 'Zen Flow' vibe is supported by the 'breathe' workout type, focusing on intentional, breath-centered movement. The low-intensity level, combined with the music's relaxed pace, supports a grounding experience, scoring 0.6.\n\nLastly, 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe is mildly present due to the upbeat 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' radio stations, which provide an enjoyable rhythm and energy flow, though at a manageable pace, giving it a score of 0.5.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor' were excluded due to the low intensity and lack of high-intensity music or competitive elements in the metadata."
