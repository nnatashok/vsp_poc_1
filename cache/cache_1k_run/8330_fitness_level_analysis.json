Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "A 15-minute duration and categorization as 'On the Mat' with a 'flow' type hint at low-intensity, light energy expenditure. It seems suitable for relaxation and flexibility improvements rather than cardiovascular exertion, supported by the 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' music, which indicates a calm environment rather than high intensity. Hence, it aligns most strongly with a light effort difficulty, with a slight consideration for moderate effort through sustained flow sequences requiring some stamina.",
