  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 15-minute duration and description focusing on opening shoulders, chest, and back suggest a session that\u2019s not particularly high in intensity. The music genre includes 'Chill mid' and 'Cool/Downtempo', which suggests a relaxed atmosphere. Although the involvement of twisting could slightly elevate the effort level, the short duration keeps the effort difficulty primarily 'Light', with a touch of 'Moderate'.",
