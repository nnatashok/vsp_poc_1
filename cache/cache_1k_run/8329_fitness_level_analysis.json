  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a row-based session, indicated by the category 'row', and has a focus on 'proper technique'. This suggests a leaning towards Beginner-level technique difficulty, as proper rowing technique can be taught and practiced at this level. Additionally, the workout's goal to 'steadily climb in rhythm' suggests that precision and focus on form are emphasized, but these are at a basic level due to the 'breathe' workout type, which aligns with low technique complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 16 minutes and the 'breathe' workout type indicate a Moderately challenging effort for beginners. The intensity is rated 1 out of 3, suggesting a lower effort level, but the 'climb' format could elevate it slightly within the Moderate range. Thus, the effort required aligns between Light and Moderate, with emphasis slightly stronger on Moderate due to the rhythm and climb component.",
