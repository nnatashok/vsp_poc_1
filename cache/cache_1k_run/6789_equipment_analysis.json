  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is a 'Gentle Restorative Yoga' session, which typically involves movements and poses performed on the floor. The category 'On The Mat' strongly indicates that a yoga mat is required for the exercises. Additionally, the image shows a mat in use, further confirming its necessity. Therefore, a mat is identified as essential with very high confidence (0.9). Other equipment isn't mentioned or visually indicated, implying the workout relies primarily on the mat for execution."
