  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'Drive' workout which automatically suggests a more complex row and sets the floor at Intermediate. While rowing is typically a technique-focused activity, the Drive classification elevates the technique to Intermediate due to the pace and precision required at a max rhythm of 28. The nature of interval training (2-minute intervals) demands that users adapt their technique quickly, supporting this classification.",
