  "spiritsExplanation": "The spirit 'Structured & Disciplined' is prominently featured due to the focus on '3 points of contact for every stroke', indicating a methodical and instructional approach (score: 0.75). The use of clear instructions and foundational skills is indicative of structured training.\n\nThe image indicates an outdoor rowing machine setup, contributing to an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Although the workout itself is not in nature, the setting adds an element consistent with outdoor themes (score: 0.6).\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is marginally present because of the music choice (Pop mid, Global Hits) which typically supports rhythmic movement, but it's not a primary focus of the session (score: 0.4).\n\nThe workout is a warm-up, suggesting reduced intensity; thus, 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are not applicable. 'Soothing & Restorative' is also excluded as the session is more technical than recovery-focused."
