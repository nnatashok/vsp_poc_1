  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Bodyweight Strength' session focusing on building strength, particularly in the lower body and core, indicating a significant use of bodyweight exercises. The mention of 'keeping your heart rate elevated' also suggests some cardiovascular component, but not intensive enough to categorize as HIIT. The metadata explicitly lists 'On The Mat' as a category, suggesting floor-based exercises, which, along with the description, justifies including 'Mat' as a secondary category with a moderate score. No props or equipment are required, reinforcing the 'Body weight' categorization as predominant with a high score. The music, while lively (Dance mid, Global Hits), supports a potentially dynamic session but does not imply a dedicated dance or aerobics workout, which aligns with bodyweight exercises to maintain heart rate."
