  "vibesExplanation": "The workout primarily fits 'The Reboot Workout' vibe with a score of 0.9 due to its focus on a cool-down session after intense activity. The title, 'Race on the Thames Cool-Down,' and the description, 'Take the pressure off your legs after the race,' indicate a recuperative and low-intensity workout designed to refresh and recover the body. The use of 'Thinking Out Loud' and 'Shivers' by Ed Sheeran suggests a relaxing atmosphere, further emphasizing the calming and restorative nature of the vibe. 'The Meditative Grind' vibe scores 0.7, as the workout involves steady, repetitive rowing with a max rhythm of 22, indicating a consistent and focused effort that encourages zoning in and finding a rhythm. The music genre, listed as 'Pop low, Global Hits,' supports a tranquil setting, contributing to both the calming and meditative qualities of the workout. The cool-down nature rules out higher intensity vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter.' Overall, the evidence aligns well with the chill, recovery-focused attributes of the selected vibes."
