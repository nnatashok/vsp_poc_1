  "vibesExplanation": "The workout's title and description highlight a focus on technique, indicating a strong alignment with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe, which emphasizes skill-building and technical focus. The cool-down and low-intensity nature of the workout, combined with a focus on rowing, also suggest aspects of 'The Reboot Workout,' which is about relaxation and refreshing the body, matching the cool-down context. Additionally, the light rowing and repetitive motion involve elements of 'The Meditative Grind,' where the focus is on zoning in and methodical pace, although this match is moderate given the primary focus on technique refinement. The music tracks 'Jubel' and 'The Luckiest' align with a soothing and calming atmosphere, enhancing the relaxation aspect typical of a cool-down."
