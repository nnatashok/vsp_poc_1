  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Beginner Core Pilates\" has two primary spirits. Firstly, \"Flow & Rhythm\" is a strong match (0.7) due to the nature of Pilates, which emphasizes smooth, coordinated movements and core engagement. The music playlist, featuring artists like Train and Alanis Morissette, suggests a steady, rhythmic pace conducive to maintaining a flow state during the workout. The \"On The Mat\" category further supports this classification.\n\nSecondly, the image shows an outdoor environment by the water, suggesting elements of the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit (0.6). The setting in Ballinrush enhances the connection to nature, making this spirit relevant, though the workout's primary focus remains on the mat. Overall, the combination of Pilates focus and outdoor setting caters to both rhythmic flow and adventure."
