  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves rowing with a format designed to 'open up and activate your body,' suggesting focus on basic movements rather than complex techniques. Rowing typically defaults to Beginner or Intermediate technique. The 'breathe' aspect implies simple controlled movements. Therefore, strong Beginner alignment (0.9) with moderate Intermediate alignment (0.4) due to combination format.",
