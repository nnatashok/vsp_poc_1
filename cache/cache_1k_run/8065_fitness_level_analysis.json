  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session lasts only 5 minutes and 47 seconds, indicating a very light effort requirement. The pilates focus on 'stretching' and 'core strengthening' generally involves lower intensity compared to cardiovascular or high-intensity interval training. The metadata indicates the use of chill and downtempo music genres, which also supports a relaxed and gentle workout pace, reinforcing the light to moderate effort rating. Given the session's brevity and focus on flexibility, it fits predominantly in the light category with minor overlap into moderate for those unfamiliar with Pilates.",
