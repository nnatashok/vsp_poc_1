  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly named 'Core Pilates', and the description further confirms it is a Pilates session focused on core strengthening. The category 'On The Mat' in the metadata suggests a mat-based workout, which aligns with Pilates practice. Although the 'On The Mat' tag could suggest general mat exercises, the explicit mention of Pilates in both the title and workout type heavily implies that Pilates is the correct classification. The use of lightweight, body-centered movements in Pilates justifies the absence of specified equipment. The music plays more of an ambient role and does not influence the workout classification. The high confidence level is due to repeated, clear indication of Pilates throughout the metadata."
