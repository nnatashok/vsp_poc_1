Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of just over 20 minutes and described as a 'flow' sequence, the workout likely maintains a steady, low-to-moderate pace. The chill and downtempo music suggests a less intense and more relaxing atmosphere, which aligns with a Light to Moderate effort classification. While it's not particularly intense, the fact that it targets tension relief in major upper-body areas suggests a Moderate exertion level as users maintain certain poses and continuously engage muscles.",
