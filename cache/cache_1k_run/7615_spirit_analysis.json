  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily a cool-down session described explicitly as focusing on staying connected, which aligns with a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The low rhythm and steady format suggest a gentle and calming approach, consistent with recovery and relaxation (Score: 0.8). \n\nThe inclusion of popular music with a laid-back vibe such as 'Steal My Sunshine' and 'Down Under' reinforces a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the music-driven pacing and emphasis on smooth, continuous movement (Score: 0.6).\n\nThe image provided shows the workout taking place on a river, which is an outdoor setting, adding an 'Outdoor & Adventure' element to the session, despite the low intensity. The natural environment leverages the terrain, emphasizing exploration and connection with nature (Score: 0.7). \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were not chosen due to the clear focus on cooling down and relaxation, and not on high intensity or precise structure."
