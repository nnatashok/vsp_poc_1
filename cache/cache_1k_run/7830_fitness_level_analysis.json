  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This workout falls under the 'row' category, which restricts the technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. Although the use of intervals may suggest intermediate technique, the focus is on rhythm and simple movement patterns, aligning more strongly with Beginner level techniques. The metadata, highlighting 'Focus in on your technique' and the rhythmic shifts, suggests some combination of coordination and rowing form emphasis, giving a moderate score for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is relatively short at 11 minutes and 33 seconds, but it involves climbing intervals with a max rhythm of 28. This setup implies fluctuating intensity within a condensed period, aligning with moderate to challenging effort difficulty. The 'sweat' workout type and a workout intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggest significant physical demand yet suitable for users easing into higher effort workouts, supporting these scores.",
