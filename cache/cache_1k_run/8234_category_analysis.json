  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Find Your Legs Row' strongly indicates that it is centered around rowing, supported by terms like 'cruising down the Charles River' and the category tags 'row'. This suggests an indoor rowing workout, especially given the emphasis on leg power, which is integral to rowing. The 'Format: Intervals' and 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3' indicate a high-intensity workout strategy, aligning it with HIIT, as these often incorporate interval formats. The music playlist featuring upbeat dance and global hits supports an energetic and motivating atmosphere, typical of intense workouts. The absence of explicit mentions of equipment rules out other categories such as Weight workout or Mat exercises. Thus, the primary classification is 'Indoor rowing' with a high score of 0.9, and 'HIIT' with a supportive score of 0.7 due to the interval nature and high intensity."
