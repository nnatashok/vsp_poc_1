  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'The Explorer's Workout' primarily due to the scenic theme of exploring mountains in Alaska, which suggests an adventurous and open-air challenge. The mention of 'Adventure Row' emphasizes a sense of exploration and outdoor activity, aligning with that vibe, hence a strong score of 0.8.\n\n'\"The Meditative Grind\" is applicable because the workout description mentions maintaining a consistent split, which suggests a focus on steady, repetitive rowing across intervals. The category mentions 'breathe,' indicating a meditative component that fits this vibe, warranting a score of 0.7.\n\nFinally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is considered due to the rhythmic nature of rowing, coupled with pop and global hits music, which can create an elevated energy and feel-good movement. The interval format, though low intensity, may still contribute to an endorphin-releasing experience, hence a score of 0.6."
