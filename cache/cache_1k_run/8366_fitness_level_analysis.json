  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive', which as per Hydrow-specific rules, typically involves more complex rowing techniques that go beyond beginner-friendly movements due to the higher requirement of rhythm and power. Combined with the 'row' category and the objective of accumulating maximum meters, it positions this session as Intermediate in technique, despite its seemingly straightforward rowing format.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is driven by the 'drive' format with an intensity level of 3 out of 3, indicating a highly demanding session. The workout's short duration of 11 minutes and 18 seconds coupled with a high rhythm (34) suggests high-intensity intervals near maximum output, which is consistent with challenging effort. The focus on power and maximum meters adds to the demanding nature, placing it between challenging and extreme.",
