Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of over 20 minutes with exercises executed in short intervals (45\" work followed by 15\" rest), which contributes to a moderate intensity level. For a deconditioned individual, maintaining activity for 20 minutes, especially with exercises like squats and push-ups, requires a reasonable amount of effort, thus aligning it more with Moderate (score: 0.8), though some aspects are relatively light (score: 0.5) due to rest periods.",
