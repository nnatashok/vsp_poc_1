  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Pick Drill Cool-Down' emphasizes technique and a cool-down phase, clearly aligning with activities typical to indoor rowing. With the mention of 'row' in the category, it strongly suggests a rowing context. In addition, 'max rhythm: 24' and the structured format aimed at 'cooling down and your heart rate returns to baseline' further confirms indoor rowing, as these are common terms and goals associated with rowing exercises. The inclusion of acoustic music aids in supporting a relaxed, technique-focused workout. The evidence provides very high confidence (0.9) that this is an Indoor Rowing workout. No other categories such as 'Stretching', 'Yoga', or 'Meditation' are relevant due to the explicit mention of rowing and focus on technique."
