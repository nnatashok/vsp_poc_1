  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 21-minute yoga flow session with a focus on 'gently' opening the hips indicates a lower overall physical demand. The flow is neither highly dynamic nor high-intensity, supported by the smooth, chill music playlist. Consequently, it fits well within the Light effort category, while some aspects could edge into Moderate due to the session's length.",
