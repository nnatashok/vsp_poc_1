  "categoriesExplanation": "This workout is classified as 'Indoor rowing' due to several explicit indicators in the metadata. The workout name 'Power Climb Row' directly suggests a rowing workout. The description mentions 'building endurance and strength,' and the term 'climbing in rhythm' suggests varied resistance, typical in rowing machine sessions. The use of 'row' in the category and the format 'Climb' aligns with rowing workouts where users adjust resistance levels to simulate climbing. The workout type is listed as 'sweat,' indicating a physical and aerobic activity, further supporting the rowing classification. The moderate intensity level of 2 out of 3 and the duration of just over 11 minutes suggest a shorter, potentially intense rowing session. Other potential categories like 'HIIT' or 'Body weight' are excluded due to the lack of interval training or specific bodyweight exercises mentioned. Therefore, 'Indoor rowing' is the most suitable category with very high confidence."
