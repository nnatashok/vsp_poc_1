Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is relatively short at 5 minutes and 48 seconds, which typically correlates with lower physical demand. Additionally, it's a 'cool down,' which inherently involves lower effort compared to the main workout session. The low rhythm (22) further supports the classification of Light effort difficulty. While Olympian-level coaching could add intensity, the overall intent of the session suggests minimal exertion, aligning strongly with the Light difficulty classification.",
