  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Steady State Row' and is categorized under 'row', which strongly indicates the requirement of a rowing machine with very high confidence. The description also mentions a 'steady state row at rhythms 20 to 22', emphasizing the consistent use of rowing equipment. The image provided depicts an outdoor rowing setup, yet in the context of a workout video indoors, it would be interpreted as using an indoor rowing machine. These elements collectively support the necessity of a rowing machine for this workout."
