  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'On The Mat,standard,on-the-mat,' which strongly implies the need for a mat, especially for floor exercises or yoga-based flows. The description notes a 'core-focused flow,' a type typically performed on a mat to ensure comfort and support during floor-based exercises. The image also shows an exercise that appears to be performed outdoors on the grass, which would usually require a mat for comfort and stability. Given the context and categorization, there is a very high confidence that a mat is essential for this workout."
