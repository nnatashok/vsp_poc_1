  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Sweat, standard, row'. In rowing workouts, the technique difficulty typically ranges from Beginner to Intermediate due to the fundamental nature of the rowing movement, which does not demand highly complex techniques. The description emphasizes using intervals, which are a common feature in beginner to intermediate rowing routines. However, given the guidance by an Olympic-level rower, there is a slight emphasis on technique, indicating a mix between beginner and intermediate levels. Thus, there's a strong alignment with Beginner difficulty, with some elements of Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves four sets of 4-minute climbing intervals over a total of 21 minutes, which suggests that it is more demanding than a simple steady-state row given the intervals. The max rhythm of 30 strokes per minute and intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicate a workout that is meant to challenge but remain accessible to a wide audience. This aligns it with a Moderate effort difficulty, leaning towards Challenging, given the Olympic-level guidance and the motivation to build confidence.",
