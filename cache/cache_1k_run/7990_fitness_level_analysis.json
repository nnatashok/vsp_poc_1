  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 21 minutes long and involves climbing intervals, which suggests a moderate level of exertion. The interval training style, combined with a max rhythm of 30, implies intermittent periods of increased intensity, aligning more strongly with 'Moderate' effort but also somewhat aligning with 'Challenging' due to the continuous effort in intervals.",
