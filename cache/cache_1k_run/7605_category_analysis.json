  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Power Flow' strongly suggests a Yoga workout, specifically a style of Yoga that is dynamic, known as 'power yoga' or 'flow.' The description mentions 'build heat as you move with Owen through a power flow,' which indicates a Yoga practice focused on building intensity and incorporating physical postures in a continuous sequence. The optional mention of 'Yoga blocks' further solidifies this classification. Therefore, Yoga is assigned a high score of 0.9 due to the explicit reference to a 'flow' and context indicating a Yoga practice.\nThe category 'Mat' is included with a score of 0.6 as there is reference to the workout being 'On The Mat,' a common term for exercises performed on a mat, often indicating a mat-based routine, such as Yoga. Furthermore, no equipment usage is mentioned, supporting a mat-based exercise classification. The lack of specific details on high-intensity or other categories makes it clear this is not HIIT or another more intense category, and the music genre 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' aligns with a calming yoga practice rather than a high-paced workout."
