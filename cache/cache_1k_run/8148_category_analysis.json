  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under the 'Mat' category with a score of 0.9 due to the description indicating 'rolling of your glutes, quads, and back' using a foam roller, which is consistent with exercises performed on an exercise mat. The use of a foam roller for muscle massage suggests floor-based mobility exercises typical of this category. \n\nAdditionally, 'Stretching' is another relevant category, scored at 0.7, given the terms 'mobility' and 'rolling' suggest elements of flexibility improvement and muscle recovery. The short duration (10 minutes 41 seconds) and focus on specific lower body and back areas further emphasize stretching movements. The absence of an instructor or complex equipment reinforces the likelihood of this being a low-intensity flexibility session, appropriate for a stretching classification. \n\nOther categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Pilates' were considered but ultimately excluded due to the lack of mention of specific yoga poses, core-strengthening movements, or their typical methodologies in the metadata. The playlist and music information contribute to the ambiance but do not heavily impact the classification."
