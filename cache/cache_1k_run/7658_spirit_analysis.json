  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' because it is a cool-down session with a focus on gradually reducing heart rate, which aligns with recovery and relaxation. The description mentions a cool-down along the shores of Lake Tahoe, emphasizing a calming, gentle environment. 'Outdoor & Adventure' is also relevant given the mention of Lake Tahoe and the image displaying an outdoor setting on the water, reinforcing the natural and exploratory aspect. 'Flow & Rhythm' is slightly relevant due to the rowing format and the musical background of mellow pop hits, adding a rhythmic component. The other spirits are excluded due to the primary focus on cooling down and the serene, outdoor setting indicated in the metadata."
