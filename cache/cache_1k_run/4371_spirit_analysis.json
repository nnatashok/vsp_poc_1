  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is clearly a \"Soothing & Restorative\" session, as indicated by the title \"Steady Cool Down,\" the description emphasizing a 'cool down' and focusing on personal relaxation, along with the low max rhythm of 22. These elements imply a gentle, recovery-focused energy that is typical for restorative workouts. Consequently, it has been given a high score of 0.9 for the Soothing & Restorative spirit.\n\nThe presence of outdoor rowing in the image further supports categorizing the session as \"Outdoor & Adventure,\" allowing engagement with nature during the cool down. However, because the focus remains largely on soothing recovery, the score for this spirit is set at 0.7.\n\nOther spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Sport & Agility\" are excluded due to the low intensity and rhythm described in the workout metadata."
