  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Relax + Reflect Cool-Down' suggests an activity focused on rowing with a calming and reflective component, likely involving full strokes on a rowing machine as indicated by the phrase 'take full strokes.' The classification as 'cool down,' combined with terms like 'Max rhythm: 24' and 'Format: Steady,' strongly suggest a lower intensity rowing session. Even though the workout is described as calming, it should not be mistaken for Stretching, Meditation, or Yoga since it involves structured rowing strokes. The reflected structure confirms that 'Indoor rowing' is a primary category with high confidence, supporting a score of 0.8."
