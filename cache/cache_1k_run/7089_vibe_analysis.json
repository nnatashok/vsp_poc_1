  "vibesExplanation": "The workout \"Tree Pose Align Yoga\" presents a calming and intentional vibe, reflected in the focus on improving a specific yoga pose, the tree pose, alongside the peaceful setting of snowy mountains. The choice of chill and downtempo music further reinforces a grounding and meditative atmosphere, aligning well with \"The Zen Flow\" vibe, which embodies grounding and intentional movement. This vibe is assigned a score of 0.8 due to the strong alignment with breath-centered yoga practice.\n\nThe description emphasizes alignment and repetition, which fits \"The Meditative Grind\" with a score of 0.7, as it involves zoning in and letting repetition take over, characteristic of pose-focused yoga sessions.\n\nFinally, the outdoor setting and gentle nature of yoga contribute to \"The Reboot Workout\" with a score of 0.6, promoting a low stress and refreshing experience ideal for total-body refreshment. The lack of high-intensity elements excludes other vibes such as \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Adrenaline Rush.\" Overall, the vibes assigned reflect a tranquil and introspective workout."
