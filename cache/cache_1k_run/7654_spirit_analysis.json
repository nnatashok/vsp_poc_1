  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Core Flow' is strongly aligned with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The title and description emphasize a 'flow' and breathing coordination, which are central characteristics of this spirit. The mention of 'core focused poses' and music-driven pacing with a 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' playlist further reinforce this classification, suggesting a smooth and continuous movement pattern. This spirit is given a high score of 0.85 due to the title, workout type, and music choice.\\n\\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' element is evident due to the workout's focus on softening the upper body and following the breath, indicative of relaxation and stress reduction techniques. Phrases like 'soften your upper body' and the use of yoga blocks suggest a restorative nature, giving it a moderate score of 0.7.\\n\\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is relevant due to the outdoor setting near water, captured in the image, giving this spirit a moderate match score of 0.6. The environmental aspect contributes to a slightly less dominant, but still significant presence of this spirit.\\n\\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the lack of intensity and strict structure in the metadata."
