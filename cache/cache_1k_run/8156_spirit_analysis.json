  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Whittier Challenge Row' is classified with a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, scoring 0.9, due to several factors: the title mentions a 'challenge', the description specifies a focus on 'maximum meters' in a 'one-minute challenge', which implies a high-intensity effort. The format 'Power' and intensity level of '3 out of 3' further support this classification. Additionally, the explicit lyrics and music genres 'Dance high, Global Hits' contribute to a lively and vigorous atmosphere, aligning strongly with a high-energy spirit.\\n\\nThe image of rowing on a natural body of water also suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, scoring 0.8. This setting provides environmental challenges and exploration elements typical of outdoor adventures. The rowing on open water complements this spirit classification. Other spirits were considered but showed little matching evidence based on the available metadata."
