  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'HIIT Row,' explicitly indicating a combination of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) and rowing. The description further confirms this by mentioning '90\", 60\", and 30\" sprints,' which aligns with HIIT's characteristic short, intense intervals. The use of 'drive through your legs' refers to rowing mechanics. The format listed as 'HIIT' and the category tag 'row' solidify these classifications. Therefore, the categories chosen are 'Indoor rowing' with a strong presence as the core activity, and 'HIIT' reflecting the training style. The intensity level of 3 out of 3 also supports the high-intensity nature of this workout. Other categories are excluded as the metadata strongly specifies both the activity and method, leading to a high confidence level of 0.9 in this classification."
