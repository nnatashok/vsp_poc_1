  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for this workout is classified as Intermediate due to the row-based format and the Drive workout type. Rowing as an exercise generally requires a certain level of coordination, especially when paired with a Drive format which is designed to push performance (as suggested by the name Drive), thus bumping it up to Intermediate. The race-like structure and rhythm variations further contribute to this classification. Rowing workouts cannot surpass Intermediate in the technique difficulty metric, ensuring compatibility with Hydrow's guidelines.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is marked with an intensity level of 3 out of 3 and involves repeating intervals at high rhythms of 28 and 30, indicating a high-intensity effort across its 16-minute duration. The short duration combined with high rhythm levels and the lack of prolonged rest suggests a high intensity that aligns with a Challenging level. The music genre and selection hint at maintaining a high tempo, reinforcing the challenging effort level intended for users who are fit, though still approachable for determined beginners with relevant motivation.",
