  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Drive', which according to Hydrow's specific rules, defaults to an Advanced technique level due to the inherent complexity and skill required for Drive workouts. The requirement of maintaining a high rhythm (30+) also supports the Advanced classification, as this demands a high level of coordination and control. However, given that the workout is fundamentally rowing-based, there is still some alignment with Intermediate due to the general nature of rowing movements, albeit less so here.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's effort difficulty is highly influenced by its classification as a 'Drive' workout with a maximum rhythm exceeding 30. The intensity level is marked as 3 out of 3, indicating high physical demand, further supported by the interval format which implies less rest. The 21-minute duration with high rhythm challenges suggests a Challenging to Extreme effort, but the classification leans more strongly towards Challenging due to the duration not reaching a high-demand threshold typical of Extreme levels.",
