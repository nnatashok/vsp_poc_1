  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Yoga' due to the emphasis on 'sun salutations' which are a series of poses typically associated with Yoga. The description specifically mentions focusing on the alignment during sun salutations, a core component of many Yoga practices. The keyword 'align' and guidance on proper shoulder alignment further indicate a structured practice common in Yoga. In addition, the tags 'On the Mat' and 'standard' suggest a typical Yoga practice rather than a casual mat routine, reinforcing the classification. The overall music selection and genre descriptors like 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' are ambient, aligning with a calm and focused Yoga session. Given the metadata, the assignment of 'Yoga' reflects very high confidence due to clear, explicit indicators."
