  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Steady Speed Row' embodies several spirits based on the metadata provided. \n\n1. **Flow & Rhythm (0.7):** The low max rhythm of 20 and format described as 'steady' indicate a focus on maintaining smooth and continuous movement, characteristic of the Flow & Rhythm spirit.\n\n2. **Outdoor & Adventure (0.8):** The mention of 'exploring Bergen' and the image showing rowing on a river point strongly toward an Outdoor & Adventure spirit, leveraging natural settings for the workout.\n\n3. **Soothing & Restorative (0.6):** With a low intensity level (1 out of 3) and a focus on breathing, this session also aligns with the Soothing & Restorative spirit, emphasizing relaxation and lowered exertion.\n\nThe choice to exclude High-Energy & Intense is due to the low intensity and steady rhythm, lacking the fast-paced and demanding nature typical of that spirit. Similarly, the structured or sport-specific elements common to the Structured & Disciplined and Sport & Agility spirits are absent."
