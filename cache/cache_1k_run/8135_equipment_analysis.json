  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly categorized under 'row', and the description focuses on rowing-related activities, such as warming up, driving, and cooling down, all of which are integral to rowing machine workouts. The workout title \"All in One Row\" and the instructor's background, heavily emphasizing rowing, reinforce the centrality of the rowing machine to this workout. Given these factors, there is very high confidence (1.0) that a rowing machine is required as it forms the core component of this workout routine."
