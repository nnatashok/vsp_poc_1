  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout can be classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure.' The use of music with dance and global hits suggests a rhythmic element to the workout, which aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The setting, as seen in the image, being on the water also adds to this classification. Additionally, the outdoor environment aligns strongly with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The workout is described as 'beginner-friendly' with a low intensity level (1 out of 3), indicating a gentle and accessible approach, aligning with 'Soothing & Restorative.' The description mentions segmenting the workout into manageable five-minute parts, promoting an easy flow. Although the workout is structured into segments, the overall approach and beginner focus suggest a lighter emphasis on discipline, hence excluding 'Structured & Disciplined.'"
