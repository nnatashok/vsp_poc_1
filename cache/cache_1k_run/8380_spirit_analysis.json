  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Finding Grace in Movement Row' primarily embodies the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit given the description's emphasis on finding balance and rhythm (20 and 22 strokes per minute). This suggests a focus on smooth, consistent movement, and coordination, scoring a 0.9 for a strong match. The image shows the workout is conducted outdoors on a river, supporting an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The natural setting likely enhances the environmental aspect of the workout, earning it a score of 0.8.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also present but to a lesser degree, given the 'breathe' focus and low intensity level (1 out of 3), which indicates a more relaxed, less strenuous session. This assigns it a 0.6 score for a moderate match.\n\nThe steady format and lack of high intensity cues exclude a 'High-Energy & Intense' classification. Similarly, there's no structured protocol or sports-specific skills that would indicate a 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Sport & Agility' spirit."
