  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration of 5 minutes and 35 seconds suggests lower intensity overall, but since it's a core-focused session, the effort is slightly elevated. The description does not provide specifics on the rhythm or intensity, but 'Ignite your core' implies a moderate level of engagement and effort, aiming at core endurance. The use of music like 80's hits can enhance engagement without adding significant physical demand.",
