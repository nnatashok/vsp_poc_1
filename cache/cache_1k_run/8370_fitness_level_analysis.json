  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 5 minutes and 35 seconds, suggesting a brief session that likely incorporates some intensity due to the focus on core activation. For users in poor physical shape, this duration at a steady pace without rest periods can be moderately demanding. Consequently, while the exertion remains feasible for beginners, it could be experienced as moderately challenging, thus earning strong scores in both Light and Moderate categories.",
