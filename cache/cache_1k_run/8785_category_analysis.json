  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 0.8. This is based on the workout name 'Cross Training Row', which explicitly references rowing, and the general context and playlist suggesting a structured activity akin to rowing sessions. The video's 'steady' format and 'Max rhythm: 24' also align with indoor rowing parameters. The 'Breathing exercises' category is identified with a moderate score of 0.5 due to phrases like 'breathe' and the low-intensity level of 1 out of 3, which implies a focus on technique and breathing control. The 'Breathe, standard, row' tags suggest a dual focus on both rowing and controlled breathing. Other categories like 'Stretching', 'Yoga', or 'Meditation' were considered but excluded since the core activity revolves around the rowing machine and is not purely focused on flexibility or mindfulness practices."
