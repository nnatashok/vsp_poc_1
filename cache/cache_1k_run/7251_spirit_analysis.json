  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Bodyweight Strength' is primarily classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' because it is conducted outdoors in the scenic setting of Seville, Spain, leveraging the environment for the workout, which is a key component of this spirit. This classification is very strong (score: 0.9).\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is relevant given the four rounds of exercises described, indicating a clear, methodical approach to the training session. The presence of specific exercises and a systematic format supports this classification at a high confidence level (score: 0.8).\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' is also a likely spirit due to the music selection, which includes energetic dance and club mixes that typically accompany vigorous workouts. While the session is not described as particularly intense, the music suggests an underlying energetic component, giving this spirit a moderate score (score: 0.6).\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are less relevant due to the strength-focused and structured nature of the workout."
