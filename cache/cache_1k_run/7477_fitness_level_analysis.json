Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's short duration (just under 6 minutes) and its classification as a 'cool down' strongly suggest a Light effort difficulty. Cool downs are fundamentally designed to gradually lower heart rate and relax muscles, requiring minimal energy exertion. The rhythm gradually decreasing further underscores the low intensity and energy expenditure typical of a Light effort workout, aligning perfectly with the ease required for beginners or those in poor physical shape.",
