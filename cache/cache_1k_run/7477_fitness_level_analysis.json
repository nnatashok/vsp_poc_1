Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 5-minute cool-down rowing session, inherently designed to be less demanding, aligning with the 'cool down' focus. This suggests that the session is meant to decrease heart rate gradually after vigorous exercise, thus the primary effort is Light. However, it features a rhythm alteration from 22 to 18, which might prove slightly more demanding for some users, leading to consideration of a Moderate label as secondary. Therefore, the effort difficulty is primarily Light but with some aspects justifying a Moderate consideration.",
