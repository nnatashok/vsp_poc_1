  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is categorized primarily under 'Indoor rowing' due to explicit mentions of rowing-related terms in the title ('High Energy Row') and description ('reach high intensities...with Sera Moon'). Additionally, the format of 'HIIT' is mentioned in the description, indicating that this is a High-Intensity Interval Training workout. The intensity level is high (3 out of 3), and the intervals of 30-second, 45-second, and 1-minute are characteristic of HIIT training. These elements collectively contribute to high confidence ratings for both 'Indoor rowing' and 'HIIT'. There is no mention of other equipment or workout styles, and no elements suggest alternative categories such as 'Mat', 'Yoga', or 'Body weight'. The music choice and high rhythm align well with a high-energy interval training session, supporting the chosen categories."
