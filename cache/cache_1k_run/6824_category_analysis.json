  "categoriesConfidence": 0.9,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Indoor rowing' based on the title '1-Minute Sprints Row' and the description indicating the use of a rowing machine with the terms '1' on, 1' off' suggesting intervals on a rowing ergometer. The presence of 'row' in the category tags further supports this classification. The score is set at 0.9 as the evidence is explicit. Additionally, 'HIIT' is included due to the workout's structure of high intensity ('1 on, 1 off'), with a format specifically labeled as 'HIIT' in the description. The presence of high-intensity intervals in a short, structured session supports a strong score of 0.8. The 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3' indicates a maximal effort, consistent with HIIT workouts. Other categories were excluded as the metadata strongly emphasizes rowing and interval-based intensity, rather than general cardio or strength training."
