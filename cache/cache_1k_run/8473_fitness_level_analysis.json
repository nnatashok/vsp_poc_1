Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 20-minute duration of the workout and the circuit format involving EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute) suggest a demanding workout. Considering the high tempo set by the max rhythm of 26 and one-minute intervals, the workout is likely quite taxing, requiring sustained effort. This aligns with a 'Challenging' effort level for less fit users, given the continuous movement and intensity suggested by both the format and rhythm data.",
