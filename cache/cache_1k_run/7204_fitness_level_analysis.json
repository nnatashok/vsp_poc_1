  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "In this workout, the combination of 'drive' workout type and 'pyramid' format implies a measure of complexity often associated with intermediate-level rowing technique, as it involves maintaining form through varying rhythm and intensity. The metadata tags it as 'Drive', which on Hydrow indicates an expectation of some coordination and effort but not reaching advanced complexity, aligning with an Intermediate rating.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity is rated 3 out of 3, reflecting significant physical demands. The 21-minute duration with increasing interval lengths (30\", 45\", 60\") requires sustained effort, aligning with moderate to challenging difficulty. Given intervals and pace descriptors, the effort is substantial, grading strong for 'Challenging', requiring robust energy expenditure despite the workout's concise duration.",
