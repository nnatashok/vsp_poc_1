  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Instructional: Recovery Pauses' is strongly indicative of an indoor rowing session due to the phrase 'recovery portion of your stroke,' which is specific terminology used in rowing. The description mentions cycling through pauses with 'Mac,' likely referencing a rowing stroke pattern rather than actual cycling. Although the workout is mentioned as 'warm-up,' which does not fit perfectly into the standard categories, the primary focus appears to be on rowing technique. The choice of music genres like 'Indie Alternative' and 'Global Hits' and the specific songs listed do not contribute directly to classifying the workout category but maintain a calm, steady rhythm that aligns with the indoor rowing theme. Thus, 'Indoor rowing' is assigned a score of 0.9 due to strong related indicators."
