  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's title \"All in One Row\" and description indicate a balanced session beginning with a warm-up, followed by a sweat-inducing main segment, and finishing with a cool-down. This structured format, alongside the 'Sweat' category and 'Sweat intensity' description, suggests a \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit (score: 0.75). The interval training format and max rhythm of 28 indicate a moderately challenging level, contributing to this classification. \n\nThe image of participants rowing outdoors on a river corroborates the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit (score: 0.8), as it aligns with both nature-based and exploration elements. The use of popular 90's and global hits adds to an engaging atmosphere, supporting the outdoor adventurous spirit. The classification confidence is high due to strong supporting evidence from both the metadata and visual content."
