  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which suggests that the technique difficulty should fall within Beginner or Intermediate. The description refers to 'power strokes' and 'steady intervals', indicating some coordination is needed, but overall the workout involves standard rowing movements suited for those at the beginner level. The technical aspects are straightforward as it's all based on rowing mechanics, with some potential increased coordination required for transitions between intervals.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 21:24 minutes, combined with the interval format ('2-minute and 3-minute intervals'), suggests a moderately challenging effort level. Although labeled with a workout intensity of '1 out of 3', the inclusion of 'power strokes' implies periods of increased intensity, which might be challenging for those with low fitness. However, the overall energy expenditure aligns more closely with 'Moderate' due to the managed intervals and rowing pace, suitable for beginners progressing to a moderate level.",
