  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is aptly classified as 'Indoor rowing' and 'HIIT' based on the provided metadata. The title 'HIIT Row' directly suggests a high-intensity interval training session that involves rowing, which fits both the 'Indoor rowing' and 'HIIT' categories. The description reinforces this with the mention of 'high-intensity intervals' and a 'Max rhythm' of 32, aligning with HIIT's defining characteristics of alternating periods of intense effort and rest. Furthermore, the playlist and music genres enhance the high-energy atmosphere typical of HIIT. The score of 0.9 for 'Indoor rowing' reflects the central role of rowing in the workout, while the 0.8 score for 'HIIT' acknowledges the strong presence of interval training format. Other potential categories like 'Mat' or 'Body weight' are excluded due to the lack of evidence supporting exercises without rowing equipment."
