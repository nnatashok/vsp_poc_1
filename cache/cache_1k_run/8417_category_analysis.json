  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout 'Upper Body Strength with Bands' primarily falls under 'Body weight' due to the use of resistance bands, which is a typical method for bodyweight resistance training. This is supported by the reference to strength training in the workout description and the absence of any free weights or machines, implying a reliance on body weight and band resistance. The 'Mat' category is also relevant, indicated by the title 'On The Mat' and the implied use of a mat as the workout focuses on upper body strength exercises, likely performed on the floor. The 'Weight workout' category is included with a lower score due to the use of resistance bands simulating weights, but since no actual weights are used, it is less definitive. The confidence is high due to the explicit emphasis on resistance band exercises for strength training in the description."
