  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive', which typically aligns with Advanced technique due to its focus on maintaining consistent, precise rowing form at high intensities. However, given the Hydrow-specific rule that 'row' workouts are generally at most Intermediate, this category is applicable. The emphasis on rhythm and intensity suggests that maintaining form under these conditions is a key aspect, elevating the complexity slightly but still within Intermediate bounds.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is a HIIT session at rhythm 30 for over 21 minutes with a maximum intensity level of 3 out of 3. The high-intensity intervals and continuous drive effort are demanding, especially since they demand maintaining a high stroke rate and power. This aligns strongly with the Challenging category due to its significant energy demand and high exertion levels, particularly for less fit individuals.",
