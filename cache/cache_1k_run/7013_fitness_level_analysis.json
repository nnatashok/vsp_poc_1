  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', indicating that the technique difficulty can only be 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate'. The use of the term \"intervals climbing in rhythm\" suggests a moderate complexity in timing and coordination, which supports a strong alignment with 'Intermediate'. However, rowing generally involves straightforward movements, which also weakly aligns with 'Beginner'. Overall, these factors suggest a primary classification of 'Intermediate'.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 21 minutes and 30 seconds with an intensity level marked as 2 out of 3 and the format set to interval training. This suggests a moderate level of exertion, which aligns strongly with 'Moderate'. However, the climbing rhythm intervals can be demanding, especially given the intensity description, leading to a partial but significant alignment with 'Challenging'.",
