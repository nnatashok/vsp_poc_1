  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'row' type, under the category 'Breathe,standard,row', which for Hydrow categorization means the movements are limited in complexity. The workout is meant to build a cardio base, indicating a lower level of technique required, suitable for beginners. The fact that it's labeled as 'breathe' suggests a focus on maintaining a steady rhythm rather than executing complex movements. Therefore, the technique difficulty is predominantly beginner with minor elements that might be slightly intermediate for coordination with the rhythm.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 16 minutes and 30 seconds and an intensity level of 1 out of 3 suggest a light to moderate effort given the focus is on building a 'cardio base'. The term 'breathe' implies a low to moderate intensity designed for a relaxed, steady pace. The max rhythm of 24 supports this as it indicates a moderate rowing stroke rate, appropriate for entry-level cardio development.",
