  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'On The Mat,' indicating that a yoga or exercise mat is a central part of the workout, leading to very high confidence (0.9) in its necessity. The mention of 'Yoga blocks optional' in the description suggests that while they are not essential, blocks could be beneficial for some exercises, hence a low confidence (0.3) in their necessity. The image confirms the presence of a mat and yoga blocks, reinforcing their potential use in the workout."
