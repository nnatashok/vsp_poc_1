  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled 'Holding Your Power Row' and categorized under 'row' strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine. The category itself includes 'row', which according to the guidelines mandates the inclusion of a 'Rowing machine' with a high confidence score. Additionally, the description mentions 'working on sustaining your power as your rhythm shifts,' which is indicative of rowing-specific training. The presence of 'Dani along the Charles River' metaphorically suggests a rowing setting, reinforcing the need for rowing equipment. Given these factors, a Rowing machine is required with very high confidence (1.0). No other equipment is implied by the metadata."
