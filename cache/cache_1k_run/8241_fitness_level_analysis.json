  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 11 minutes long and involves yoga, which is typically not high in intensity. The description 'lengthen your side body' and 'gentle twists' indicate low energy expenditure activities. The relaxing music genre further suggests a low-intensity session, making a Light effort difficulty appropriate with a score of 0.75. The short duration could make it slightly more than minimal effort, allowing a Moderate score of 0.4, though this is less dominant.",
