  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is clearly classified as a stretching workout based on several strong indicators in the metadata. The title 'Essential Stretches for Your Back' explicitly mentions stretches, which aligns with the stated 'Workout Type' of stretching. The description supports this by specifying 'mobility exercises and stretches for your back,' emphasizing a focus on flexibility and range of motion. The 'Category' field includes 'On The Mat,' reinforcing that this is a mat-based routine typical of stretching exercises, which often do not require extensive equipment, matching the note that a 'Foam roller' is optional. The playlist with chill and downtempo music suggests a calm, relaxed session, characteristic of stretching routines. Given these factors, the classification as a 'Stretching' routine is assigned a very high score of 0.9."
