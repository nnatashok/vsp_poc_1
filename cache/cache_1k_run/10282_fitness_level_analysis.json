  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 10-minute circuit designed to elevate heart rate through continuous activity with exercises such as double pulsing squats and mountain climbers. The inclusion of a rowing pace at 22-24 s/m also adds a mild cardiovascular element. The quick transitions and varied exercises indicate a low-to-moderate energy expenditure level, which, though challenging, remain within moderate difficulty due to the short duration and beginner-friendly intensity. It requires some effort from less fit individuals but is not overwhelmingly demanding.",
