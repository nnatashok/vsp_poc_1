  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features basic bodyweight exercises like squats, planks, and toe touches, which are considered simple movements requiring minimal coordination. The inclusion of dynamic elements like speed skaters and burpee variations without jumps or push-ups adds some complexity, potentially leaning towards an Intermediate designation. Thus, the technique difficulty aligns best with Beginner with some elements of Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 10-minute circuit involving exercises like squats and mountain climbers, which require some effort particularly with increased pace at 22-24 s/m rhythm. While it is beginner-friendly, the fast pace and combination of exercises might pose a slight challenge, leading to a Moderate rating, especially with the conditioning intent indicated by the instructor. Thus, it aligns with both Light and Moderate levels.",
