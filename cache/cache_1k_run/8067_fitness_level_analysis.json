  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The row category typically aligns with Beginner or Intermediate Technique Difficulty. Given the interval format and moderate rhythm of 22 through 26, the exercise demands some coordination, consistent with Intermediate Technique. However, rowing's inherent simplicity also supports a Beginner rating. Therefore, this workout gently aligns with both Beginner (0.7) and Intermediate (0.5) levels with high confidence due to strong metadata indicators supporting simple rowing movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as having an intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicating moderate effort. The duration of 11 minutes combined with 4-minute intense intervals suggests moderate to challenging energy expenditure. Given the interval structure with controlled heart rate increases, the effort aligns more with Moderate (0.75) difficulty, with some elements of Challenging (0.6) due to the potential difficulty in maintaining elevated rhythms for deconditioned users. This analysis is of high confidence, based on clear metadata hints.",
