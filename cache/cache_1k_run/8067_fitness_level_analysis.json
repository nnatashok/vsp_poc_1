  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' which indicates a technique difficulty primarily within 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate' levels. The interval format suggests a focus on rhythm change, which aligns with coordination and pacing, characteristic of an Intermediate level. However, rowing itself is largely accessible for most beginners, especially since no complex movements or exercises beyond rowing are specified in the metadata. Thus, Beginners would still find this navigable, warranting strong Beginner and moderate Intermediate scores.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 11:21 with two 4-minute intervals indicates sustained effort. The description highlights elevating heart rate, and a max rhythm of 26 emphasizes intensity within the set timeframe, signifying a more energy-demanding activity than Light. The use of a 2 out of 3 intensity level aligns with Moderate difficulty, with brief but intense intervals suggesting some alignment with Challenging, although less dominant due to the moderate overall rating and typical rowing format.",
