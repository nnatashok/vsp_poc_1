  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified with a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit at a high confidence of 0.95. The '3-minute sprinting efforts' indicate a fast-paced, high-intensity session, further supported by the tags such as 'max rhythm: 32' and 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3'. The high-tempo music choices like 'Dance high' and 'Global Hits' also contribute to the intense vibe.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is highly relevant, scored at 0.9. The visual evidence of rowing on a natural body of water surrounded by Alaska's wilderness, along with the description 'Encounter Alaskan wildlife', strongly supports this classification. The outdoor and exploratory elements are emphasized through this environmental context.\n\nThe presence of nature-based imagery and activity, combined with the high-intensity workout format, justifies the exclusion of other spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' since there is little indication of methodical structure or smooth coordination focus."
