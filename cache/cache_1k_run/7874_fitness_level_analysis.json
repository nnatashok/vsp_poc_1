Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 20 minutes and 45 seconds and the steady row format point to a workout more demanding than very light exercises but not reaching high intensity. The use of a 'journey' workout type with a focus on endurance suggests effort beyond a simple Light level, but the description does not indicate high-intensity intervals or particularly strenuous activity. The metadata indicates a mix of Light and Moderate effort suitable for improving aerobic capacity without overwhelming less fit users. Hence, scores of 0.5 for both Light and Moderate effort levels are appropriate.",
