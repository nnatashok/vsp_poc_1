  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Flow + Restore' is strongly aligned with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to its emphasis on a 'yoga flow' that naturally incorporates smooth, continuous movement patterns. The playlist, featuring songs with relaxed and downtempo vibes, further supports a rhythmic experience, resulting in a high score of 0.9 for this spirit. The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also prominently featured, as indicated by the focus on 'restorative poses' meant for relaxation and stress reduction, aligning well with the intended yoga practice intended to 'celebrate International Day of Yoga.' This dual focus on both flow and restoration justifies its notable score of 0.8 while excluding other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' due to the absence of any intense, athletic, or competitive elements."
