Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, titled as a 'warm-up,' involves technique reinforcement and power intervals. With a duration of only 5:52 minutes and the nature of warm-ups generally being lower in intensity, this places the effort difficulty as Light. The inclusion of a power interval could introduce a momentary increase in effort, justifying a small rating for Moderate. Nonetheless, the primary function is to prepare for more demanding workouts, keeping overall energy expenditure minimal.",
