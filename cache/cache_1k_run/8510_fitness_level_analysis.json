  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The AMRAP format suggests sustained effort over the 21-minute duration, which implies a moderate level of intensity, especially with a cardio focus interspersed with rowing recovery intervals. The high-energy music playlist and description hint at sustained but manageable effort, suitable for multiple fitness levels. It's moderately challenging due to the duration and intensity cues from music and AMRAP structure.",
