Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's format as an AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) within a 21-minute duration suggests moderate intensity due to continuous movement and limited rest. The use of dance and high-energy music implies a moderately upbeat pace. However, the absence of heavy equipment keeps it from becoming overly demanding, thus moderate to challenging. Less fit users might find it challenging due to consistent lower body engagement and cardio components, yet it's accessible to a fairly broad range of ability levels.",
