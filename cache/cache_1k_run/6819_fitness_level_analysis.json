  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is classified as a 'cool down' and has a short duration of about 6 minutes, focusing on low rhythms. The low rhythm (max rhythm of 22) and the steady format indicate minimal intensity and energy expenditure, typical of a light effort workout. The primary aim is recovery, evidenced by terms like 'help your body recover.' Thus, there's a strong alignment with the 'Light' effort category, reflecting a non-demanding rowing workout suited for recovery purposes.",
