  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified with an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit because it is conducted on a helicopter pad, a unique and unconventional outdoor setting that provides an adventurous backdrop, as seen in the image and mentioned in the description. This unique location offers an element of exploration and non-traditional workout environment, justifying a high confidence level. \n\nAdditionally, the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is relevant due to the music playlist featuring upbeat Hip Hop/R&B tracks, which typically aim to energize the participants and maintain a high intensity. Phrases like 'Ignite your core' in the description suggest an intense workout focus. The short duration of the workout (about 11 minutes) also hints at a more concentrated, high-energy session. \n\nThe structured nature of 'Core Strength' workouts may suggest 'Structured & Disciplined,' but given the metadata and setting, the primary spirits align better with the adventurous and energetic aspects."
