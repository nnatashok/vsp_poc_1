  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'High Energy Row' and the category includes 'row,' both of which strongly indicate the use of a rowing machine. The term 'row' in the workout type and category makes it evident that a rowing machine is central to this workout. Additionally, there is no mention of other equipment in the description, reinforcing the idea that a rowing machine is the primary equipment needed. Given these factors, the confidence that a rowing machine is required is very high, thus a score of 1.0 is assigned."
