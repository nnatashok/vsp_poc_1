  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 15-minute session involves whole-body exercises. The mention of exercises like planks and up-downs signifies moderate to challenging effort difficulty. Given the 15-minute duration, the energy expenditure isn't extreme, but the pace may cause increased effort for less fit users. This supports a 'Moderate' classification with a possibility of some workouts being 'Challenging' as users are encouraged to push their limits.",
