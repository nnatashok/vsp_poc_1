  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is a 'Whole Body Pilates' session, explicitly mentioned to follow a classical pilates structure, typically performed on a mat. The category 'On The Mat' reinforces the need for a Mat. Additionally, the image shows the instructor standing on a mat, further confirming its necessity.
