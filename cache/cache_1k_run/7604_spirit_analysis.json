  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Fourth of July Row' is clearly marked by an outdoor setting as seen in the image, which places it strongly in the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit with a score of 0.9. The workout appears to be conducted on a river, focusing on exploration and the natural surrounding, which aligns closely with this spirit. \n\nThe description suggests a celebratory and community-focused event, pairing with popular and dynamic music such as 'American Pie' and 'Party In The U.S.A.'\u2014these elements support a secondary 'Flow & Rhythm' classification with a score of 0.7. The combination of interval format and a 'sweat' type aims for energetic engagement and coordination with music.\n\nGiven the focus on rhythm and music-driven motivation, there is a notable presence of 'Flow & Rhythm', although it's more prominent as a complementary spirit. The moderate workout intensity and festive theme further enhance the rhythmic connection, particularly with the mid-series tempo described, supporting community engagement and fun."
