  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is designed to help users recover post-row, indicating a gentle approach suitable for deconditioned users. With a duration of approximately 11 minutes, this aligns with low energy expenditure typical of light recovery routines. The music described as 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' further reinforces a calming atmosphere. The effort level is primarily classified as 'Light', due to the nature of recovery-focused yoga, but some elements might offer 'Moderate' physical engagement due to alignment focus.",
