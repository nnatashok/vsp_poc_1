  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and 'drive,' which typically indicates a focus on power and rhythm. It involves sprinting pieces with high effort, demanding good coordination to maintain rhythm and form under intensity. Given Hydrow's rules where 'Drive' workouts are considered to have advanced technique elements, the technique difficulty is suitable for 'Intermediate' with high confidence. Complex coordination isn't required, but maintaining form during high-intensity rowing is slightly challenging.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' with HIIT format and maximum rhythm of 30 indicates a very high-intensity workout. The description notes 'Use all of your effort and power,' aligned with a maximum intensity level of 3 out of 3. The short duration but high rhythm and intensity indicate an 'Extreme' effort difficulty level, as users must sustain maximal rowing sprints, demanding very high energy expenditure and effort.",
