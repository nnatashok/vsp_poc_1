  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Morning Yoga Flow,' and the category is 'On The Mat, standard, on-the-mat,' indicating a strong emphasis on floor-based exercises typical of yoga sessions. This suggests that a mat is essential for comfort and safety during the flow. Yoga practices typically occur on a yoga mat, enhancing stability and reducing the risk of injury, hence the high confidence score of 0.9. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata, reinforcing that a mat is the primary requirement."
