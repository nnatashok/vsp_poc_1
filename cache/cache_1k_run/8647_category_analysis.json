  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Indoor rowing' based on explicit references to rowing activities ('Racing Stories Row', 'row', 'Charles River', and 'drive') and the format which involves intervals. This justifies a strong presence with a score of 0.9. The mention of a rhythmic goal (max rhythm: 28) and structured format (interval training) aligns well with the characteristics of rowing workouts.\n\nAdditionally, the 'HIIT' category is relevant due to the use of interval training sessions ('2-minute intervals', 'intensity level: 3 out of 3') which is a common trait of High-Intensity Interval Training. The driving rhythmic and high-energy playlist (dance and global hits music genre) further supports this categorization, earning it a secondary score of 0.7.\n\nNo evidence supports the inclusion of other categories, as the workout clearly focuses on rowing intensively within an interval format."
