  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' and 'sweat', indicating rowing-based exercises, which typically fall within the Beginner to Intermediate range for Technique Difficulty. The mention of 'intervals' suggests some coordination but is not overly complex, aligning with Beginner to Intermediate levels. The presence of an Olympian instructor implies a well-structured session, potentially introducing elements that could elevate the complexity to Intermediate but not beyond, especially since the user fitness level requirement specifies Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 21:26 minutes with intervals, implying a sustained effort which is more demanding than light exercises. The 'sweat' category and a max rhythm of 30 suggest a focus on cardiovascular endurance. The second-level intensity out of three indicates moderate to challenging effort, especially with climbing rhythms, aligning with both Moderate and Challenging levels. The dynamic nature of intervals with rhythmic climbs supports effort above light yet not reaching extreme levels.",
