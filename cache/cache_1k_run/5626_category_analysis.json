  "categoriesExplanation": "The metadata for the workout video 'Bootcamp HIIT Row' clearly indicates a focus on rowing at high intensities. The title itself includes 'HIIT Row,' which signifies a combination of high-intensity interval training and rowing. This is reinforced by the description that mentions 'short intervals at high intensities as you row,' situating rowing as the primary activity. The format 'HIIT' and intensity level '3 out of 3' further confirm the strenuous and structured nature, typical of high-intensity workouts. The absence of typical meditation, yoga, or stretching keywords, along with the presence of high-energy music tracks and a fast maximum rhythm of 32, align well with the characteristics of HIIT rowing sessions. Therefore, the categories 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 0.9 and 'HIIT' with a score of 0.8 are appropriate due to their strong presence and central role in the workout."
