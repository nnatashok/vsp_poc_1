  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout 'Step by Step Row' was primarily classified under 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 0.8. The inclusion of 'row' in the title and the description containing elements like 'Climb' and 'rhythm and intensity with Nick and Laine' strongly suggests it's a rowing workout done on a machine. The max rhythm of 24 and the format labeled as 'Climb' further support this classification as common features of an indoor rowing session. Additionally, the category 'Breathing exercises' was selected with a score of 0.6. The mention of 'breathe' as both a workout type and category implies a potential focus on breathing techniques during rowing, which may be why it's differentiated from a purely physical rowing session. The overall confidence is tempered by the fact that the intensity level is 1 out of 3, indicating a less intense workout, but this is common in monitored breathing exercises. Other potential categories like 'Pilates' or 'Yoga' were excluded due to the clear rowing indicators and lack of language or context relevant to those practices."
