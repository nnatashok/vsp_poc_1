  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout type is classified under the category 'row' which means a rowing machine is essential for the activity. This classification is supported by the instructor's emphasis on rowing, as stated in 'every row' and 'fun, lighthearted personality to every row', highlighting that the use of a rowing machine is central to the workout experience. Further, Nick Karwoski, being a former U.S. National Triathlon Team member, adds credibility to the rowing-centric focus of this workout. Therefore, the confidence level for needing a rowing machine is very high at 1.0."
