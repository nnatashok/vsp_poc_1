  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'breathe,' indicating a less intense session as confirmed by an intensity level of 1 out of 3. The 21-minute duration with a focus on rhythm suggests a sustained but not overly taxing effort. Based on this, the effort difficulty aligns well with 'Light,' although the slightly sustained effort hints at a moderate demand for deconditioned users. Thus, both 'Light' and 'Moderate' classifications are considered, with higher alignment confidence in the 'Light' category due to lower intensity cues.",
