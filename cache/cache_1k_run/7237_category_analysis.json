  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is clearly an 'Indoor rowing' session based on explicit terminology in the metadata. The 'Workout Name' and 'Description' both mention rowing as the main activity. The 'Format: Power' and intensity level of 3 out of 3 further support this, indicating a vigorous indoor rowing session. The 'Max rhythm: 38+' suggests a high stroke rate typical of indoor rowing workouts aimed at maximizing effort. The absence of specific equipment details and the fact that the workout is not a relaxed session, disqualifies categories like 'Stretching', 'Meditation', or 'Yoga'. With clear and direct references to rowing, the classification as 'Indoor rowing' is made with very high confidence and a score of 1, reflecting its central role as the defining characteristic of the workout."
