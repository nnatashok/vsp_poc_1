  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Heat Building Yoga Align,' which explicitly specifies it as a 'Yoga' session. The description mentions 'move with your breath through sun salutation,' indicating traditional yoga practice, which is typically performed on a mat, hence the secondary category 'Mat.' The tags 'On The Mat' and 'on-the-mat' further reinforce this context. The yoga session lasts about 11 minutes and features music genres like Chill and Cool/Downtempo, which are common in yoga sessions designed to maintain a relaxed yet focused environment. The selected categories exclude others such as Stretching or Meditation, as they do not fit the primary focus of sun salutations in yoga."
