  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is clearly classified as 'Indoor Rowing' due to multiple references to rowing in the metadata. The title 'Your Comeback Cool-Down' and phrases in the description such as 'row along the Charles River' and 'returning to rowing' strongly suggest the use of a rowing machine. Although this is a cool-down, which could imply low intensity similar to stretching or meditation, the focus remains on rowing, distinguishing it as an Indoor Rowing session. The max rhythm indicates a controlled pace appropriate for cooldowns, further confirming the rowing nature of the workout. The evidence strongly supports Indoor Rowing as the primary category for this workout."
