  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is only 6 minutes and 2 seconds, which is very short. The focus is on relaxation, indicated by terms like 'calm your mind' and 'relax your body'. The lack of intense physical activity, typical of restorative yoga sessions, means that the energy expenditure is minimal, fitting perfectly into the 'Light' effort difficulty level.",
