  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'breathe,standard,row', explicitly indicating a rowing activity. The title 'World Water Day Row' further emphasizes that rowing is the primary focus. Since this is an indoor platform, a 'Rowing machine' is highly likely required to perform the exercises effectively. The description and context align with a rowing theme, justifying a very high confidence score for the need of a rowing machine."
