  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Strength' features elements that align well with 'The Groove Session' vibe due to its music choices and setting. The use of Hip Hop/R&B and Global Hits playlists suggests a rhythmic, enjoyable workout experience, indicative of 'The Groove Session' vibe, with a strong score of 0.7.\n\n'Core Strength' also fits 'The Endorphin Wave' due to its focus on igniting core muscles and the mid-level intensity of a 10-minute workout. The phrase 'ignite your core' implies a steady, energizing workout experience designed to release endorphins, thus it has a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nOther vibes were excluded as the workout's emphasis on core strength, moderate duration, and rhythmic music does not suggest high intensity or meditative qualities. The scenic outdoor setting on a helipad adds to the experience without impacting the vibe classification significantly."
