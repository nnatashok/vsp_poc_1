  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is clearly described as a 'HIIT' session in both the title 'Travel Tips HIIT Row' and the description, which mentions 'high intensity 1-minute intervals followed by 1-minute of recovery'. The term 'row' in the workout name, along with the category tags 'drive,standard,row', strongly indicates that this is an 'Indoor rowing' session. Furthermore, the intensity level is marked as 3 out of 3, which aligns with typical high-intensity workouts. The use of music genres associated with energetic and dynamic beats, such as dance and global hits, further supports the classification of this session as a high-energy workout. The combination of these factors justifies assigning high scores to both 'Indoor rowing' and 'HIIT' as the primary categories for this workout. Other potential categories like 'Weight workout' or 'Body weight' were excluded due to the lack of relevant indicators or equipment details that would suggest weight-related exercises."
