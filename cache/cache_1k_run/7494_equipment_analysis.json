  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is labeled in the category 'On The Mat,' indicating that a mat is likely required for the exercises. The image further supports this as it shows the instructor on a mat. The workout is described as a 'whole-body circuit,' which commonly involves exercises performed on a mat to target the lower body and core, aligning with the workout description. Therefore, the confidence for requiring a mat is very high. No other equipment is explicitly mentioned or implied by the provided metadata or image, suggesting that the workout is focused on bodyweight exercises on the mat."
