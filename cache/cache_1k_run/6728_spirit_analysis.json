  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to several strong indicators: the description mentions 'turn up the heat' and 'climbing interval,' suggesting challenging and vigorous exercise. The 'Power' format, combined with a max rhythm of 30+ and an intensity level of 3 out of 3, further supports this classification. The playlist features energetic pop hits, which enhance the high-energy atmosphere, earning a score of 0.85.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is also relevant as the image shows rowing on a river in an urban outdoor setting. The environmental aspect aligns with this spirit, noted by the river setting in the image, giving it a score of 0.75.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative,' were not selected due to the focus on intensity and competition, and the lack of emphasis on recovery or soothing elements."
