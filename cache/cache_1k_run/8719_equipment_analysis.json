The description also mentions an 'interval on Hydrow,' which is a type of rowing machine, so it is also included with a confidence score of 1.0. Additionally, the workout is categorized under 'On The Mat,' suggesting the use of a mat for certain exercises, giving it a confidence score of 0.7 based on implication. The imagery supports the use of dumbbells and a rowing machine, further strengthening the classification."
