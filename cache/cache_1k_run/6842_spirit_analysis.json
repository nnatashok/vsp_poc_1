  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Feel Good Cool-Down' clearly positions itself as a cool-down session, suggesting an emphasis on recovery and relaxation following more intense exercise, fitting the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a high confidence score of 0.8. This is supported by the laid-back music choices, featuring 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' and 'Hey, Soul Sister,' which further enhance the calming and uplifting nature of the session.\n\nThe visible rowing setting on the water in the image points toward the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, as the workout takes place in a natural, open environment. This environment often contributes to a sense of exploration and engagement with nature, warranting a score of 0.6.\n\nAlthough the session has elements of rhythm and steady pacing, given the max rhythm indicator of 22 and the musical accompaniment, 'Flow & Rhythm' is a less dominant spirit but still present with a score of 0.4. The structured and methodical nature of rowing adds to this rhythmic aspect, but it's not the primary focus of the session."
