  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout 'Mastering Low Rhythms' is classified under 'row', indicating a rowing-based activity where the technique difficulty is typically 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate'. The description mentions 'drive through your legs' and 'lengthen out your stroke to hit lower rhythms', suggesting a basic rowing technique with focus on leg drive and posture. These are fundamental rowing techniques suitable for beginners, complemented by the category 'Breathe', which implies a simpler workout structure. Therefore, Technique Difficulty is rated high for Beginner and moderately for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is just over 11 minutes with an intensity level of 1 out of 3. This indicates a low-intensity session designed to maintain a jogging pace, aiming at controlled breathing and rhythmic movements. The 'Breathe' category, combined with a maximum rhythm of 22 strokes per minute, suggests a relaxed and steady pace, contributing to Light effort difficulty. The 'Interval' format may add brief moderate elements, hence a slight alignment with Moderate effort. However, overall, it remains predominantly Light.",
