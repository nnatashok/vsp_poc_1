  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', which typically limits technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate levels. The absence of a specific instructor suggests less focus on technical coaching, reinforcing the perception of a lower complexity level. The 'sweat' type implies a focus on intensity over technical detail, supporting a primary classification of Beginner with a moderate note towards Intermediate due to the rhythm max of 30.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is primarily moderate due to the workout's duration of 21 minutes and 30 seconds and a max rhythm of 30, aligning with higher intensity within a manageable timeframe for less fit users. The workout intensity level of '2 out of 3' suggests more effort than light workouts but not reaching extreme exertion, classifying it as mainly Moderate with a slight tendency towards Challenging.",
