  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Finding Stillness Restore' is clearly aligned with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to its focus on restorative poses and finding stillness, as emphasized in the title and description. The use of yoga blocks and chill, downtempo music further enhances the calming and recuperative nature of the session. A high score of 0.9 reflects this perfect embodiment of a soothing and restorative spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the outdoor setting as evident in the image, with the waterfront backdrop in East Boston, supports the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. Practicing in nature contributes to an adventurous ambiance, worthy of a score of 0.7, indicating a strong match. This setting enhances the restorative nature by integrating elements of the outdoor environment. \n\nThe absence of high-energy activities, structured protocols, or sports-specific skills excludes other spirits from consideration."
