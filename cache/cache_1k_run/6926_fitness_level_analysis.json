  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout falls under the 'row' category and involves rhythmic interval climbing with a max rhythm of 30, suggesting the need for coordination to maintain cadence. However, rowing typically requires basic technique. The Intermediate level is suggested for those managing pace changes, contributing to a higher score but it's accessible to beginners, aligning with Hydrow's guidelines for rowing workouts.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, labeled as 'sweat', indicates a moderate to high effort level. A duration of over 11 minutes with interval training contributes to a higher physical demand. Level 2 out of 3 intensity suggests more than light exertion but not the maximum, warranting a moderate classification with elements of challenge due to the interval factor.",
