  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is classified as 'drive', indicating advanced technique skill typically needed due to the specific Hydrow designation. However, because it is predominantly a rowing workout, the complexity of movements aligns with an 'Intermediate' level for rowing. This is further supported by the 'HIIT' format, which involves structured interval training but with a focus on rowing, reducing overall technique complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 46 minutes long with a maximum rhythm of 30 and is labeled as high-intensity interval training (HIIT). This suggests a physically demanding session with varying intensity periods and minimal rest. The intensity level noted as 3 out of 3 supports a 'Challenging' to 'Extreme' effort classification for users in poor shape. Additionally, the advanced fitness requirement further indicates a tough workout.",
