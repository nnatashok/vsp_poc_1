  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Post-Row Mobility with Foam Roller,' which explicitly mentions the use of a foam roller, warranting a very high confidence score of 1.0. The description also specifies 'using your foam roller,' reinforcing this requirement. Additionally, the category 'On The Mat' implies that a mat is needed for the exercises, which is common for floor-based mobility workouts, thus assigning it a high confidence score of 0.9. The image supports these inferences, showing a foam roller and mat being used."
