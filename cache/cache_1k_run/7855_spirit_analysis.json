  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 1.0. The explicit mention of 'HIIT' (High-Intensity Interval Training) in the title, coupled with a maximum rhythm of 32 and a top intensity level rating of 3 out of 3, clearly indicates a vigorous and challenging workout session. The description emphasizes quick, intense intervals, further supporting this classification.\n\nSecondary classification as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.7 is suggested by the image showing an outdoor rowing scene, which implies a connection to nature and exploration. However, since the metadata doesn't specify the outdoor nature of the session explicitly, the confidence is slightly lower.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are less applicable here, as the primary focus is on intensity and outdoor elements rather than rhythm or structured progression."
