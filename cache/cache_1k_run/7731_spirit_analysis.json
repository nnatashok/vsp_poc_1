  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Steady State Row' is classified mainly as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a high score of 0.9, as the image shows the session taking place on a river, which aligns with the spirit of leveraging natural settings. 'Flow & Rhythm' is scored at 0.7 because the workout focuses on rowing at specific rhythms (22 and 24 strokes per minute), indicating an emphasis on consistent, smooth movement patterns and music-driven pacing. The playlist includes popular, rhythmic songs such as 'DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love' and 'Shape Of You', which enhance this spirit. 'Soothing & Restorative' receives a lower score of 0.4, as the workout's intensity is only 1 out of 3, suggesting a gentler, more relaxed approach. The term 'breathe' in the workout type and category further supports a calmer experience. However, the rhythmic structure and music diminish the stronger alignment with this spirit."
