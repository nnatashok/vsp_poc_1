  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 11 minutes and the description of a 'fast paced flow' intended to build body heat suggest a workout that demands moderate energy expenditure. The energetic playlist supports a brisk yet sustainable activity level, which could be challenging for less fit users but not overly taxing. Given these factors, 'Moderate' effort difficulty is appropriate, with some energy demand but within reach for beginners especially given the short duration.",
