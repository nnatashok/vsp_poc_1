  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout, titled '10-Stroke Builders Warm-Up', strongly indicates the use of an indoor rowing machine due to the term 'strokes' which is commonly associated with rowing. The description further supports this classification by mentioning 'ten strokes building in rhythm', a pattern typical in rowing workouts. The setting described as 'cruise along Newport Harbor' suggests a rowing imagery, reinforcing the rowing context. It is categorized as 'warm-up' and 'interval', which is consistent with rowing practices where short intervals at varying intensities are performed as part of training. No other equipment is specified, eliminating categories such as weight workout or HIIT, where other equipment might typically be involved. Therefore, 'Indoor rowing' is scored high at 0.9 for its clear alignment with rowing-related terms and the format described. The absence of explicit HIIT-style high intensity and rest intervals, or any other fitness activity context, further points to this singular classification."
