  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is based on rowing, which, according to the datasets, categorically fits within 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate' technique difficulty due to its straightforward movement pattern. The 'row' category inherently lowers complexity to either beginner or intermediate. The mention of 'negative splitting,' which involves pacing strategy, slightly increases complexity but remains intuitive enough to cap the technique at a strong beginner to moderate intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's effort difficulty is mainly determined by its 11-minute duration and the 'sweat' label, indicating moderate physical demand. With two 4-minute rowing intervals, it's designed to sustain effort, aligning with moderate demand. The maximum rhythm of 28 and an intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggest a slightly elevated physical demand, supporting a moderate to challenging effort classification, particularly suited to less fit users who might find prolonged effort demanding.",
