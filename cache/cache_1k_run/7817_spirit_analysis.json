The natural setting aligns with exploration and environmental enjoyment, further supported by the outdoor rowing location.\n\nThe interval format and category tag of \"sweat\" suggest some intensity, endorsing a \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit (score: 0.5). Although the overall intensity is moderate (2 out of 3), the presence of interval training supports a mix of exertion and rhythm.\n\nThe combination of rhythmic enjoyment and outdoor elements is the primary focus, while intensity plays a smaller role."
