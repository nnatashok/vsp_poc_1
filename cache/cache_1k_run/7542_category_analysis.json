  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is categorized primarily as Yoga, with a score of 0.9, based on the explicit mention of celebrating the International Day of Yoga and the description indicating a yoga flow. The word 'restore' and the phrase 'relax into restorative poses' further suggest a restorative yoga session, which is a specific style of yoga focused on relaxation and recovery. Additionally, the metadata emphasizes 'flow' and 'yoga' terms, aligning with yoga's practice of combining movement and breath. The secondary category assigned is Stretching, with a score of 0.6, reflecting the relaxing and restorative nature of the session, which often involves deeper stretches. Other categories such as Mat or Meditation were not chosen because the focus was explicitly mentioned as yoga and restorative work, rather than general mat work or meditation practices."
