  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row' and listed under the 'breathe' and 'standard' categories, which typically indicates beginner to intermediate technique difficulty. The max rhythm of 26 signifies a steady pace rather than technical or varied movement patterns. Given the basic nature of rowing and the absence of advanced rowing techniques mentioned, the technique difficulty is predominantly Beginner, with a slight alignment to Intermediate.",
