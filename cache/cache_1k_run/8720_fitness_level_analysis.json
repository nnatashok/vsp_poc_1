  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This is a rowing-based workout indicated by the category 'standard,row', which aligns with Hydrow's rule that Technique Difficulty can be Beginner or Intermediate. Given the focus on 'breathe' and technical instruction by an expert instructor, the movements are likely straightforward while being well-instructed, which suits a Beginner rating strongly (score = 0.9) with some room for slight intermediate complexity (score = 0.1).",
