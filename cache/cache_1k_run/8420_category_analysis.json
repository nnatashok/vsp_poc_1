  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout 'Time Under Tension Row' is classified primarily as an 'Indoor rowing' workout with a high confidence score of 0.9. This classification is based on direct evidence from the name and description indicating rowing activities ('intervals along the Charles River'), suggesting the use of a rowing machine or ergometer. The use of terms like 'row' and 'interval' further supports this category.\n\nThe workout also fits the 'HIIT' category with a score of 0.75, as indicated by the interval format mentioned in the description. While the intensity level is marked as 2 out of 3, suggesting moderate to high intensity, the focus on intervals aligns with HIIT principles, combining efforts over shorter durations to build endurance.\n\nOther categories such as 'Stretching', 'Yoga', or 'Meditation' are excluded due to the clear focus on cardio and rowing intervals, which do not align with their primary objectives. The music playlist suggests a high-energy atmosphere, further supporting the indoor rowing and HIIT categorization."
