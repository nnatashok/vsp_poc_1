  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is specified as 'Drive' and its category includes 'row', which allows technique difficulty to be either Beginner or Intermediate. Given the nature of a 'Drive' workout, which typically involves structured rowing with power strokes and the need for sustained rhythm maintenance, this suggests a higher level of coordination and form to execute effectively, aligning with intermediate rowing technique requirements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short at 16 minutes and 46 seconds, yet with an intensity level of 3 out of 3 and phrases like 'maintain high rhythms' and 'personal best', it suggests a high-intensity session. Power format indicates a focus on high energy output, further supporting a classification between challenging to extreme for less fit users.",
