  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is recorded outdoors on a river as indicated by the image, strongly suggesting an \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit with a score of 0.9. The focus on refining technique (\"catch position\" and \"legs only drills\") and the description \"Technique Cool-Down\" implies a \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit, scored at 0.7, due to the emphasis on specific training methods and progress. Lastly, the classification of the session as a cooldown, along with the choice of calm music by Citizen Cope and alt-J, hints at a \"Soothing & Restorative\" element, though less prominent, scoring at 0.5. Other spirits are excluded due to the lack of intensity or sport-specific agility in the session's description and format."
