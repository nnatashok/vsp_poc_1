  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title \"Back Bends Align\" suggests a session focusing on alignment through backbending exercises, commonly practiced in yoga or pilates, which often require a mat for comfort and support during floor exercises. The category 'On The Mat, standard, on-the-mat' further confirms the use of a mat as it's explicitly mentioned, which aligns with typical practices for exercises involving backbends and alignment. Given the description to warm up and practice on the mat, there's a very high confidence (0.9) that a mat is necessary for this workout. There is no indication of other equipment being required."
