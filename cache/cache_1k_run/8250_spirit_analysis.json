  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout spirit classification for 'Legends of Prague Row' combines 'Flow & Rhythm,' 'High-Energy & Intense,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure.' The description emphasizes rowing along with a story, suggesting a rhythmic component supported by the max rhythm detail, which indicates a structured pace; hence 'Flow & Rhythm' is assigned a score of 0.7. 'High-Energy & Intense' is relevant due to the interval format and the description of the workout type as 'sweat' alongside the moderately high intensity level, garnering a score of 0.6. While the workout is narrated as a story session, hinting at an engaging environmental experience, the specific context of 'Prague' and on-water rowing activities contribute to a moderate 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit with a score of 0.5. Despite being indoors (likely on an ergometer), the ambient storytelling and potential visualization of rowing in natural settings allow for this spirit's inclusion. Other spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are less applicable due to the session's interval structure and emphasis on sweat and energy."
