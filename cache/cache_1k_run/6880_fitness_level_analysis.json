  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'Drive' workout type, which is a specific categories within Hydrow's schema. Though rowing generally does not exceed Intermediate technique difficulty, the 'Drive' category inherently includes more complex or intense rowing sequences. Given this classification, and considering the high cadence indicated by 'Max rhythm: 30+', an Intermediate level is appropriate. Additionally, this aligns with the user requirement marked as 'Advanced', suggesting a nuanced difficulty in rowing techniques employed here.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With the workout duration of 11 minutes and 27 seconds and a max rhythm over 30, this session suggests high intensity rowing. The 'Power' format also indicates heightened effort, further supported by a 3 out of 3 intensity level. These elements indicate significant energy expenditure, suggesting a Challenging effort difficulty. The use of high-energy playlists further supports a robust physical demand, aligning with Challenging and perhaps bordering on Extreme, considering the intent to achieve climbing intervals and personal best performances.",
