  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Drive', which is a subcategory of 'row'. According to Hydrow's specific guidelines, this categorization indicates a higher technique difficulty within rowing workouts. Although 'row' typically aligns with beginner and intermediate levels, the mention of 'Power' and the format being 'drive', combined with an Advanced user fitness level requirement, suggests a strong alignment with Intermediate level due to the advanced technical execution likely required.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout intensity is rated 3 out of 3, indicating maximum effort which aligns with high intensity. Keywords such as 'turn up the heat' and 'climbing interval' imply significant physical demand and high-energy output. The 11:27 duration focuses on intensity over duration, supported by a 'Power' format, suggesting this workout is extremely effort-demanding. These support a strong alignment with the Extreme level, but given the instructor's background and motivational style, a Challenging level is also plausible for non-elite users.",
