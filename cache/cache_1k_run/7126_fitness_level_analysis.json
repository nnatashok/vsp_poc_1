  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Mind + Body Warm-Up' is a short duration workout (5:45) which aligns strongly with a Light effort level. The inclusion of 'short bursts at higher rhythms' provides a moderate intensity boost, qualifying it for Light to Moderate effort. However, as a warm-up, it's predominantly light in nature, with the interval format contributing to minor increases in exertion.",
