  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"Rhythm 18 Row\" primarily embodies the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit with a score of 0.75. The description highlights a steady rowing pace with focus on patience and rhythm, which aligns with the continuous movement and coordination typically associated with this spirit. The playlist of calm, flowing pop music from Taylor Swift also supports this interpretation, creating a smooth, rhythmic atmosphere.\n\n\"Outdoor & Adventure\" receives a score of 0.65 due to the image clearly showing the workout conducted on a river, engaging with natural surroundings and exploration elements, which is a key characteristic of this spirit.\n\nThe \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit is assigned a score of 0.6 as the workout description mentions \"breathe\" and its lower intensity level (1 out of 3) suggests a gentler, more relaxing experience. The choice of music further contributes to a calming ambiance typically found in restorative sessions.\n\nThe absence of high-intensity elements or technical precision excludes other spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Structured & Disciplined.\" The overall analysis aligns well with the metadata and visual context, ensuring a confident classification."
