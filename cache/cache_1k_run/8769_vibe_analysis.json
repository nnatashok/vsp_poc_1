  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Tampa Intervals Row' is best classified as 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.8 due to its focus on rowing intervals and consistent drive through the legs, which suggests a repetitive endurance workout with a moderate intensity level of 2 out of 3. The workout encourages a rhythmic and focused experience typical of a session where participants can get lost in movement through rowing.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is suitable with a score of 0.6. This is due to the use of rock mid-intensity music, which can elevate energy levels and provide a feel-good atmosphere, contributing to a steady build of exertion and endorphins.\n\nWhile these elements strongly suggest these vibes, there's some ambiguity due to the lack of direct music genre specification and instructor. However, the contextual indicators of interval training and music choices support these classifications."
