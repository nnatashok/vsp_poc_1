Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short-duration, 5:47 cool-down with intervals of rowing and rest, which suggests it is light in energy expenditure. It is framed as a 'cool down', further indicating a low-intensity session. The frequent pauses (30 seconds of pausing after each minute of rowing) also contribute to a low effort requirement. While Sera Moon's tough background could suggest higher effort levels in other contexts, this session maintains a good relaxation flow. Consequently, there's a strong alignment with 'Light' (0.9) and minimal alignment with 'Moderate' (0.1).",
