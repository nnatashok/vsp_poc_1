  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Heat Building + Standing Postures\" suggests a focus on fluid movement and Yoga, characteristic of the Flow & Rhythm spirit. The use of yoga blocks and the description mentioning building heat indicate a continuous, rhythmic activity, aligning with flow-centric practices. This is supported by the chill and downtempo music, suggesting a smooth, coordinated session.\n\nThe inclusion of \"Standing Postures\" and the category \"On The Mat\" also emphasize mind-body connection through stable, continuous flow, reinforcing the Flow & Rhythm spirit with a score of 0.7.\n\nThe image shows an outdoor setting with a scenic backdrop, indicating an Outdoor & Adventure spirit. The natural environment and presence of elements like water support this classification. Given this visual context, an Outdoor & Adventure score of 0.6 is justified.\n\nThe limited intensity and structured focus, based on available metadata, exclude other spirits like High-Energy & Intense or Structured & Disciplined."
