Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is only around 10 minutes, and being a mobility session targeted at recovery after travel, it involves light activity primarily focused on stretching. This aligns closely with a Light effort difficulty (score: 0.95). There's minimal to low energy expenditure expected, with no intense physical exertion needed. As it's a short session without high-intensity elements, the Moderate category receives a low score (0.2), likely due to inclusion of some slightly dynamic movements.",
