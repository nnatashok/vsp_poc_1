  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short, 6-minute cool down following an activity, with a focus on 'steadily cruise.' The format of 'Reverse Climb' during a cool down is indicative of a very light physical effort, primarily designed to lower the heart rate and stretch muscles. It does not require high energy expenditure or intense effort, aligning with a Light effort difficulty, leading to a score of 0.95. There is minimal indication of intensity necessitating a Moderate classification.",
