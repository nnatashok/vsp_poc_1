  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Drive' and 'Standard' under the 'row' category, which usually signifies either Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty due to the straightforward rowing movements involved. The inclusion of 1-minute intervals indicates slight complexity due to timing and rhythm coordination, aligning more with Intermediate technique difficulty. No special equipment or complex instructions involved strengthens the Beginner classification, but the Drive classification supports elevating the technique to Intermediate with high confidence.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a workout intensity level of 3 out of 3 and the interval format, this session is designed to be quite demanding, pushing it towards the upper levels of exertion. The duration of 11 minutes with a rhythm high of 30 implies high-intensity bursts that would challenge stamina and endurance, especially for deconditioned users. While challenging, it's not highly extensive in duration, resulting in a solid alignment with a moderate to challenging effort level based on these metadata cues.",
