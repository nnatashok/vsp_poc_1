  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 20 minutes long, which is a relatively short duration for a yoga session, indicating a Light effort difficulty. The description suggests inclusivity for 'all levels,' implying minimal physical demands, suitable for those in poor shape. The chill music genre also hints at a relaxed pace. However, the continuous aspect of 'flow' might require some low-level endurance and energy, thereby partially aligning with Moderate effort difficulty, but primarily it remains within the Light category.",
