  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Whole Body Circuit' is classified mainly as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.9. This is due to the location being specified as in the mountains of New Hampshire, evident from both the description and the outdoor setting in the image. The natural background reinforces the outdoor spirit.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'High-Energy & Intense', given a score of 0.7. The focus on building strength and the inclusion of energetic, dance-centric music such as 'Liquid Spirit (Claptone Remix)' and 'All On Me' suggests a vigorous workout that aligns with this spirit. The high-energy music supports this classification.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were considered but excluded due to the workout type being strength-focused, which generally lacks elements of these spirits. The absence of specified equipment also detracts from a 'Structured & Disciplined' classification, while the context of being on a mat ruled out 'Sport & Agility' as the primary spirit."
