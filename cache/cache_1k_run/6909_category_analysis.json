  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Yoga' with a very high confidence score of 0.9. This is based on the explicit mention of yoga in both the workout name ('De-Stress and Restore Yoga') and description ('calming, restorative yoga'). The tags also list 'On The Mat,' which is commonly associated with yoga practices. Additionally, the atmosphere suggested by the music genre (Chill low, Cool/Downtempo) aligns with yoga sessions, further supporting this classification. 'Stretching' is assigned a moderate score of 0.5 since restorative yoga often incorporates significant stretching elements, though it's not the session's focus as indicated by the metadata. 'Meditation' is given a low score of 0.3, as the calming nature implied by 'De-Stress and Restore' and the type of music used suggests a meditative component, but the primary focus remains physical yoga practice rather than meditation. Other categories were excluded due to a lack of relevant indicators in the metadata."
