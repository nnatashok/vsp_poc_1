  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout named 'High Rhythm Warm-Up' with a description focusing on 'three-stroke accelerations' and a 'max rhythm: 32+' strongly suggests a Flow & Rhythm spirit. The emphasis on rhythm and music-driven content, highlighted by the inclusion of songs like 'For A Better Day' and 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii, aligns with the music-driven pacing typical of Flow & Rhythm workouts, earning a high score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the visual showing the rowers in a natural setting on a waterway supports the Outdoor & Adventure spirit. Being on the water likely involves engagement with the natural environment, supporting exploration, which matches the spirit well, resulting in a score of 0.7.\n\nHigh-Energy & Intense was considered due to the rhythm and interval format, but the warm-up classification and overall cues do not sufficiently indicate extreme intensity. Therefore, it was not selected."
