  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Club 26 Row' emphasizes building endurance and rhythm with specific intervals set at a rhythm of 26, suggesting a prominent focus on smooth and consistent movement, aligning well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The use of the word 'rhythm' in both the title and description strongly supports this, earning it a score of 0.75. Additionally, the classification under 'sweat' and 'interval' training, combined with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicates a focus on cardiovascular exertion and sustained effort, which aligns with 'High-Energy & Intense.' Hence, it scores 0.65 in this category. Although the workout is rigorous, the intermediate fitness level suggests it's structured towards challenging, yet achievable efforts rather than pushing extreme limits, which is why 'High-Energy & Intense' doesn't score higher. The absence of specific technical or performance-based language, and no mention of outdoor settings, made other spirits less relevant."
