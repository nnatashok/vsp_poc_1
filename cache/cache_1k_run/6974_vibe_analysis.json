  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Sweat + 5 Min Mobility Combo' emphasizes a steady build and an endorphin-invoking experience. The description 'working up a sweat on your Hydrow for some climbing intervals' suggests a continuous effort typical of 'The Endorphin Wave'. The scoring of 0.7 reflects the use of climbing intervals that gradually increase intensity, matched with high-energy pop music that supports sustained motivation and a feel-good experience.\n\nAdditionally, the workout has elements of repetition and endurance due to its rowing focus, aligning with 'The Meditative Grind'. The score of 0.6 indicates moderate confidence due to the repetitive nature of rowing paired with stability-focused warm-ups.\n\nLastly, the playlist with strong, beat-driven tracks by Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez, and David Guetta infuses an energetic rhythm into the workout, connecting with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse'. This is scored at 0.5 as the music adds a fluid and strong vibe to the movement.\n\nOther related vibes, such as 'The Groove Session', were considered but excluded due to the workout's primary focus on rowing endurance rather than expressive movement."
