  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled 'Climbing Warm-Up' with the description indicating rowing in sync with the instructor, Buffy, strongly suggests the use of a rowing machine as the primary equipment. The metadata includes the category 'row,' which further confirms this requirement, as it explicitly denotes a focus on rowing activity. Moreover, the workout's format, described as a 'Climb,' may imply varying intensities or resistance, typically controlled by rowing machine settings. The explicit mention of 'rowing in sync' solidifies that the rowing machine is mandatory, resulting in a very high confidence score of 1.0. Other equipment is not mentioned or implied in this metadata, hence no additional items are needed."
