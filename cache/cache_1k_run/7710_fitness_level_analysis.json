Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is relatively short at just over 10 minutes, which typically indicates lower overall energy expenditure. This aligns with 'Moderate' due to the core focus, potentially involving engaging moves that require maintained effort. The music genre 'Dance mid, Global Hits' might influence a slightly elevated pace. But the absence of high-intensity cues and equipment maintains a strong alignment with 'Light' efforts. This mix warrants strong 'Moderate' but also considerable 'Light' effort classification for less fit users.",
