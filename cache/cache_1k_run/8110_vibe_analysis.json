  "vibesExplanation": "The workout named 'Commit to It Row' suggests an endurance-focused rowing session, aligning closely with 'The Meditative Grind' due to its repetitive, sustained nature. This is reinforced by the workout's classification as 'breathe' and 'standard', accompanied by a moderate endurance building description, earning a score of 0.8 for this vibe.\n\nThe description mentions cruising down the Charles River with soft pop tunes, which provides a calming and flow-like experience, justifying the assignment of 'The Zen Flow' with a score of 0.6. \n\nThe inclusion of a pop playlist ('Walk Me Home', 'Keep Your Head Up') suggests an elevated, feel-good energy, potentially aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave,' though less strongly, resulting in a score of 0.4. The intensity level of 1 out of 3 indicates a gentler approach, reinforcing the primary focus on a rhythmic, meditative vibe with some enjoyable endorphin-boosting elements."
