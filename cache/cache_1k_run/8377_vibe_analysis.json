  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Core Positioning Row' workout is primarily about focusing on technique and core positioning, aligning well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The emphasis on basics and rhythmic rowing reflects a steady build and repetition, thus receiving a score of 0.7. The workout's low intensity and 'breathe' format suggest a calming experience, earning 'The Zen Flow' vibe a score of 0.6. The music, featuring country and global hits, complements a reflective, calming atmosphere.\n\nThe focus on technique and core over positioning also indicates elements of 'The Masterclass Workout,' as it involves skill-building and refinement, justifying a score of 0.5. While the music is more upbeat, it does not overpower the workout's calm and focused nature. Other vibes like 'The Endorphin Wave' or 'The Groove Session' were excluded due to the absence of high energy or expressive dance elements.\n\nOverall, the workout appears to blend focus, calmness, and technique."
