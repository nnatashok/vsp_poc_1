  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 0.75. This is inferred from the metadata elements such as the 22 rhythm and the specific mention of 'standard,row' in the category, which strongly indicates a rowing-related workout. The 22 rhythm is typical in rowing sessions that maintain a steady state, rather than aim for high-intensity intervals. 'Stretching' is included with a lower score of 0.45, reflecting the 'cool down' nature of the workout and the intention to decrease heart rate gradually. This implies a focus on relaxation and slow pace, common in cool-down and stretching routines. However, this is a secondary component as the category 'standard,row' suggests a rowing-centric approach. No indication supports categories like HIIT or Yoga, hence they are excluded."
