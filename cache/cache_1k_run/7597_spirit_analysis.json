  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies a **Soothing & Restorative** spirit, as indicated by keywords like \"cool-down\" and \"proper technique,\" suggesting a focus on relaxing and gentle movements. The presence of indie alternative and mellow music further supports this classification, creating a calming atmosphere. This spirit is scored at 0.9 due to these strong indicators.\n\nThe **Outdoor & Adventure** spirit is also relevant, given the location on the Charles River, evident from the image. This environmental context suggests an element of nature and exploration, earning it a strong score of 0.85.\n\nFinally, the session also reflects a **Structured & Disciplined** spirit with an emphasis on technique and form. This is emphasized by the use of the term \"technique\" and a calm setting, suggesting a methodical approach. Despite being a secondary focus, it scores 0.6 given the structured nature of rowing.\n\nOther spirits, such as High-Energy & Intense or Sport & Agility, were excluded due to the absence of high-intensity or performance-focused indicators."
