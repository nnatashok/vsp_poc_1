  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a cool down lasting slightly less than six minutes, which indicates minimal energy expenditure and physical demand. There is no intensive work involved, as suggested by the 'steady' pace and the goal of bringing down the heart rate, which aligns with a Light effort level. The short duration and typical nature of cool downs, focusing on decreasing intensity, support this classification.",
