  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Breath Focused Restore' suggests a calming and restorative experience, indicated by phrases like 'breath guide your practice' and 'restorative session.' These keywords strongly align with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, focusing on grounding and breath-centered movement. The use of chill and downtempo music, such as Maggie Rogers' 'Back In My Body' and Noah Kahan's 'Young Blood (Acoustic),' further supports this vibe, creating a serene atmosphere. \n\nAdditionally, the inclusion of 'restore' in the description and short duration make it suitable for 'The Deep Recharge.' This vibe emphasizes gentle, restorative movement, perfect for a quick relaxation session. The score for 'The Zen Flow' is slightly higher due to the explicit emphasis on breath and grounding. The overall context and metadata lead to a high confidence in these classifications."
