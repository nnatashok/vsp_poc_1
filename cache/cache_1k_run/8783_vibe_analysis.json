  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Instructional: Recovery Pauses' is primarily centered around gentle movements and the recovery phase of rowing, as indicated by the description. This suggests a reflective and methodical approach, characteristic of 'The Meditative Grind,' which often involves zoning in on repetitive movements (score: 0.8). \n\nThe nature of the workout, being a warm-up and involving pauses, aligns with 'The Reboot Workout.' It provides a low-stress, refreshing experience suitable for preparing the body, fitting the vibe of total-body refreshment (score: 0.7).\n\nLastly, 'The Zen Flow' vibe is applicable due to the gentle, intentional nature of the workout, suggesting a calm and grounding effect, though to a slightly lesser extent than the other vibes (score: 0.6).\n\nThe indie and global hits music genres suggest a relaxed but energizing backdrop, supporting these vibes. Other high-intensity vibes were excluded due to the lack of intensity and focus on recovery."
