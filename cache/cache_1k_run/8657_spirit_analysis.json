  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'HIIT Row' is strongly characterized by a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, largely due to the use of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) as explicitly noted in both the workout name and description. The interval format alongside a maximum rhythm of 30 strokes contributes to the vigorous nature indicative of this spirit. Also, the setting on the water suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The upbeat, energetic music lineup including tracks from artists like Divinyls and Soft Cell supports the intense and engaging atmosphere. The workout's short duration and top intensity level underscore its vibrant, dynamic nature. Given the visual context of rowing on a river, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is notable as well, adding to the confidence in the classification, albeit slightly less than the primary high-energy focus."
