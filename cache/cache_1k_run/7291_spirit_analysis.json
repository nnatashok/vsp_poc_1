  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Finding Power Cool-Down' workout is best aligned with 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits. The mention of 'cool down' and 'series of pauses' suggests a focus on recovery and relaxation, which fits the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a strong match (score: 0.8). Additionally, the description mentions technical focus with phrases like 'front of your stroke' and 'Technique' format, indicating a methodical and progressive approach, which matches the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (score: 0.6). The use of outdoor imagery may slightly imply an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the rowing scene captured in a natural setting, but it's less pronounced in this context (score: 0.4). The music and environment are less central to the primary spirits but provide a supportive context."
