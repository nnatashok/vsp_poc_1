  "vibesExplanation": "The workout focuses on instructional elements, specifically on hip pivot and shoulder positioning, indicating a technique-driven session. This aligns closely with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe, characterized by a strong emphasis on skill building and technique, hence a high score (0.8). 'The Foundation Builder' vibe is also fitting as the workout highlights proper movement fundamentals and angles, a hallmark of strengthening and perfecting basics, scoring 0.7. Despite being categorized as a warm-up, which could slightly align with 'The Reboot Workout', given the non-intense, refreshing nature, this is less certain since the primary focus is instructional. The short duration and focus on foundational technique limit its match to 'The Reboot Workout', scoring 0.4. The music genre is indie alternative, which doesn't strongly influence the vibe selection in this technical context."
