  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Hamstring Stretch' and the description specifies the use of a band, strap, or towel, indicating the need for a resistance band with very high confidence (0.9). The 'On The Mat' category strongly implies the use of a mat, so a mat has high confidence (0.8) in being required. Additionally, since a strap or towel is mentioned explicitly, it falls under 'Other' equipment, with high confidence (0.9), for assisting in stretching. These elements are crucial for the hamstring stretch routine described."
