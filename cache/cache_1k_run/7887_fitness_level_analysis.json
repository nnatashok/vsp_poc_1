  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', allowing a technique difficulty rating of either Beginner or Intermediate. Given the workout's focus on interval rowing, which typically involves basic stroking techniques without requiring advanced skill, both Beginner (0.7) and Intermediate (0.6) ratings are applicable. The combined indication of an Intermediate fitness level requirement suggests slightly more structure than a pure beginner workout, but ultimately the movements are not complex.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 31:28 minutes with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, suggesting a moderately demanding session. Interval rowing at a max rhythm of 30 can elevate heart rates, particularly for those less conditioned, making it more than a light effort yet not as intense as elite-level training. Therefore, Moderate (0.7) and Challenging (0.5) labels aptly describe the effort involved, given the intended audience of generally lower fitness levels.",
