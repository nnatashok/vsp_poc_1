  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"HIIT Row\" prominently indicates high intensity through both the title and description, which emphasizes elevating heart rates with 30, 45, and 60-second intervals. The use of HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) format and music from genres like 00s Hits and Global Hits also supports a fast-paced, energetic atmosphere. Therefore, the spirit \"High-Energy & Intense\" is a strong match with a score of 0.9, reflecting the workout's focus on pushing limits and maximizing effort. \n\nAdditionally, the visual data showcases rowing on water, suggesting an environment-centric workout. This aligns well with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit, given the outdoor nature of the activity. Hence, this spirit is also relevant, albeit with slightly less emphasis, leading to a score of 0.7. \n\nOther spirits such as \"Flow & Rhythm\" and \"Soothing & Restorative\" are less applicable due to the structured, high-energy focus of this session."
