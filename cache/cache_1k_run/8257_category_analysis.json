  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as focused on stretching, particularly targeting the back and hips. The use of the term 'Essential Stretches' in the title and 'Stretch your back and hips' in the description strongly supports the classification of 'Stretching' as the primary category, warranting a high score of 0.9 due to very high confidence. The mention of 'On The Mat' in the category field and absence of equipment also suggests that this workout is mat-based, thus the 'Mat' category is applicable with a score of 0.7. Although the mention of music genres and songs provide ambiance, they do not significantly influence the core classification beyond suggesting a relaxed setting. Since the workout is clearly described as stretching-focused, other categories such as Yoga or Pilates are not considered appropriate despite their similar format."
