Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout is only 5 minutes and 47 seconds long and is specifically designed as a 'cool down', it is unlikely to be physically demanding. Cool downs are usually less intense and involve light activities meant to regulate the heart rate after more strenuous workouts. There is a small presence of effort due to the 'steady' format which might involve consistent, albeit gentle, movements but overall, it aligns strongly with a 'Light' effort difficulty classification.",
