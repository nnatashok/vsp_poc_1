  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is only 6 minutes long, and its primary focus is relaxation and preparing for sleep, as indicated by the workout name and description. The use of keywords like 'wind down', 'restore', and 'settles you for sleep' suggest very minimal physical exertion. This implies a Light effort difficulty level (score: 1.0) as it targets a gentle, calming state rather than creating physical demand.",
