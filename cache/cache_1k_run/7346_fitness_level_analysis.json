  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration (6 minutes) combined with the 'restore' type and calming music genre (Chill low, Cool/Downtempo) suggests very low physical demand.

Consequently, the effort difficulty is classified as 'Light' with very high confidence, as it suits complete beginners seeking gentle relaxation and not exertive physical activity.",
