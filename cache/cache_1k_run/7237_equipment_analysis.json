  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout name, 'May Race: Week 4 of 5', and description emphasize a rowing activity: 'Power up with Laine for one minute of rowing at your max effort.' Furthermore, the metadata explicitly categorizes this workout type under 'row', which strongly implies the need for a rowing machine. The workout's short, high-intensity nature ('Duration: 0 hours 1 minutes 45 seconds', 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3') suggests it's centered around max effort rowing, reinforcing the necessity of a rowing machine. Given these factors, there's very high confidence (1.0) that the rowing machine is required."
