  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves a combination of rowing and on-the-mat exercises within a 20-minute duration. The inclusion of exercises such as thrusters and squats suggests a moderate to challenging intensity, given the compounded movement patterns with dumbbells. The terms 'energizing' and 'challenge yourself to complete as many rounds as possible' imply elevated energy expenditure, aligning with Moderate difficulty for low-to-medium exercise energy and Challenging due to potential high-engagement from consecutive circuits.",
