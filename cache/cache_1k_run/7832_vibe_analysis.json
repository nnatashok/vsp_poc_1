  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Hip-Opening Flow' focuses on opening hips and bringing attention to the mind and body, which aligns closely with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The use of phrases like 'bring attention to your mind and body' and the flow type indicate an intentional, breath-centered movement. The playlist, featuring chill and downtempo music, also supports a calming and grounding experience, further solidifying this classification with a high score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the exercise can fit 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, as it involves gentle stretching and movement, aiming for a total-body refresh. The absence of intense physical exertion and focus on flow supports the inclusion of this vibe, with a score of 0.7.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Groove Session' were considered but excluded due to the absence of dance or expressiveness, as the workout is more about mindful stretching and relaxation."
