  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's category is 'row' and follows the Hydrow-specific rule, which limits technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The interval training format indicates a moderate level of complexity in coordination, aligning with Intermediate technique. However, the core activity of rowing is basic, supporting a Beginner level as well, albeit to a lesser extent.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout encompasses a 46-minute duration with an interval format indicated by 'Club 26' style and a moderate rhythm maxing at 26 strokes per minute. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 suggests a workout that is fairly demanding, but not overly so, thus fitting the Moderate effort difficulty. However, the long duration and structured rest phases imply that it could still be accessible at a Light effort level for some users.",
