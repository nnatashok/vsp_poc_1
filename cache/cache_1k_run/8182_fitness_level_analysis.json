Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is a 5-minute and 43-second steady cool-down on a rowing machine, which is inherently light due to its 'cool down' designation, short duration, and steady rhythm. The nature of a cooldown is to maintain low energy expenditure, aligning strongly with the 'Light' effort classification. There could be a slight 'Moderate' aspect for less fit users due to the need to maintain steady rowing but is unlikely to be significantly challenging due to the structure and intent of the session.",
