Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short at just over 10 minutes, indicating a low to moderate overall energy expenditure. The description's emphasis on 'prepare to perform at your best' suggests some intensity, strengthening the Moderate rating. Given potential vigorous intervals associated with 'racing', a weak Challenging score is also considered. The absence of equipment implies reliance on bodyweight exercises, keeping effort demands moderate but plausible with some challenge intensity.",
