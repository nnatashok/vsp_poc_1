  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'row', which, according to the established rules, limits the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. The workout description emphasizes maintaining a steady rhythm, suggesting a focus on sustained effort rather than technical complexity. The instructor's emphasis on fun and form points to Beginner-level accessibility. Hence, the Beginner level is most appropriate with a slight consideration for Intermediate due to the need for maintaining proper form in rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout spans over 21 minutes at a steady state, with rhythm levels of 20 and 22. This suggests a balance of effort suitable for improving endurance but not excessively challenging. The 'breathe' categorization, along with a low workout intensity level of 1 out of 3, indicates that the effort is mostly moderate, with some potential areas being light due to its steady, non-high intensity nature.",
