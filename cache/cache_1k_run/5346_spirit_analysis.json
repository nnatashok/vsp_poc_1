  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a high confidence score of 0.8 due to the visual evidence of instructors performing the routine outdoors in a natural setting, under a large tree, indicative of an adventurous element. The description suggests an on-the-mat, focused workout which aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit in a natural context.\n\nAdditionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is scored at 0.6. The playlist includes energetic songs like 'Pump Up The Jam' and 'Look At Her Now', suggesting a rhythmic, music-driven approach to engaging the core, fitting the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The combination of a standard core workout along with the choice of music implies a coordination of movement with music.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were not chosen as the workout is described to target core strength rather than emphasizing high intensity or a strict regimen. The music and outdoor setting also detract from a purely structured approach. 'Soothing & Restorative' is excluded due to the session's focus on feeling the burn, which suggests more effort than relaxation."
