  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata indicates that this workout falls under the 'Category: Drive, standard, row,' which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. The description emphasizes 'explode with power and speed,' which aligns with rowing exercises. Given the explicit mention of 'row' in the category, I assign a very high confidence level (0.9) to the need for a rowing machine. The image associated with the analysis also supports this as it shows a person using rowing equipment. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the workout metadata."
