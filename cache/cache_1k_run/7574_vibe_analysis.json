  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Core Burn Express' is identified as having a 'Masterclass Workout' vibe with a score of 0.7. This is due to its focus on precise technique and skill-building, typical of pilates which requires controlled movements and advanced instruction as suggested by the term 'advanced core pilates workout.' Additionally, the playlist includes popular dance and hit songs, which bring an energetic beat-driven element to the workout, aligning it with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, assigned a 0.6 score. This vibe reflects the strong, fluid, music-infused quality of the workout, as seen with songs like 'Heat Waves' and 'Came Here For Love.' The high-confidence level of 0.75 indicates clear indicators from the metadata, particularly the workout description and music selection. Other vibes were considered but excluded due to lack of relevant intensity or context, such as 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Meditative Grind,' because of the workout's more upbeat music and advanced challenge level."
