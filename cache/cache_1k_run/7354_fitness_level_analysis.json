  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 21-minute duration and the 'flow' categorize this workout primarily as a low-impact, continuous movement session. The nature of yoga itself involves sustaining poses that can lightly elevate heart rate but typically remain within a light to moderate range, which is fitting given Owen's experience across both active rowing and yoga disciplines. However, given the context (tension release and chest opening), it likely stays within a less intense domain, hence balanced between Light and Moderate.",
