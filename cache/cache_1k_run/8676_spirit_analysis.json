  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.8 due to its instructional nature and focus on technical precision in stroke mechanics, as indicated by the title 'Instructional: Arm Focused' and the description emphasizing speed and efficiency. The format and category tags such as 'instructional' and 'warm-up' further suggest a methodical approach.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit follows with a score of 0.6, informed by the setting of the workout being captured outdoors on the dock. This natural, adventurous backdrop contributes to this classification even though it's not central to the instructional focus. \n\nOther spirits were considered but not selected due to the explicit technical focus and the lack of intense cardiovascular or flow elements. The music choice (rock and global hits) complements but does not dominate the thematic content, negating 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Flow & Rhythm' classifications."
