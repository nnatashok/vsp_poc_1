  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a rowing session which is considered either Beginner or Intermediate in technique difficulty according to the preset rules for rowing-based workouts. Although rowing can incorporate rhythmic coordination and moderate technique, the interval nature and emphasis on basic endurance suggest that the movements are simple enough for a beginner with some level of exposure to the basics. Therefore, the technique aligns strongly with Beginner (score 0.9) and moderately with Intermediate (score 0.6) given it's a sweat-focused session.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is short at 15:59 minutes but involves endurance intervals in a 'sweat' category, which suggests a moderate physical demand but not overly intense. The intensity level is rated 2 out of 3, indicating more effort than light activities but not reaching the most challenging levels. The music selection supports a moderately intense pace, suitable for a workout that would challenge but not overwhelm a less conditioned individual, making it a very strong fit for Moderate (score 0.8), hence a moderate alignment with light (score 0.2).",
