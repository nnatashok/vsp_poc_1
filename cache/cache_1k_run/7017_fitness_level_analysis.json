  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'row', which typically limits Technique Difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate despite any specific movement complexity. With an indicated user fitness requirement of Intermediate, this aligns the Technique Difficulty as consistently Intermediate, also noting that interval format can add a layer of complexity for users unfamiliar with pacing and transitions. Based on this, the scores are Intermediate: 0.8 and Beginner: 0.4, due to the essential rowing form aligning mostly as Beginner to Intermediate, though the interval structure slightly elevates it.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout description indicates endurance intervals, with a 15-minute duration and an intensity level 2 out of 3, suggesting substantial, though manageable, energy expenditure. The term 'endurance' and 'sweat' imply an elevated demand. The playlist further supports moderate-intensity efforts with motivating, mid-intensity rock tracks. Considering effort difficulty hierarchy and user demographics, the scores are Moderate: 0.75 and Challenging: 0.6, reflecting a moderate primary challenge with aspects of increased demand for less fit users.",
