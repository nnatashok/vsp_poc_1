  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'December Race: Week 3 of 4' is characterized as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.9. This is supported by phrases like 'rev your engine' and 'maximum pace', plus a description of high intensity with a skill level of 3 out of 3. The music choices (energetic tracks like remixes and global hits) further reinforce this high-energy classification.\n\n'Sport & Agility' is assigned a score of 0.6 due to the competitive framing ('race' and 'conquer rhythms'), which suggest a focus on performance and skill-building, typical of sports training.\n\nThe presence of outdoor rowing seen in the image, along with the format being described as a 'drive,' suggests that 'Outdoor & Adventure' is also relevant with a score of 0.8. Rowing on a river typically brings in a significant outdoor component, adding an adventurous element to the session.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded due to lack of emphasis on choreography, relaxation, or recovery elements in the metadata."
