  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features a 10-minute circuit format, which implies sustained effort and possibly limited rest due to the EMOM structure (Every Minute on the Minute). The rowing component adds intensity but is limited to 2 minutes, keeping overall energy expenditure moderate (0.8). The use of dumbbells raises the effort but not to extreme levels, suggesting a moderate challenge level. The short duration of the workout aligns with a Moderate effort difficulty (0.8), with some challenging elements (0.45) due to quick transitions and EMOM pacing.",
