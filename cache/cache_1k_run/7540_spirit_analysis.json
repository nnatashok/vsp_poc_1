  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled \"Cardio Control Row,\" emphasizes the importance of controlling split times at specific rhythms of 22 and 24. This indicates a \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit, evidenced by the focus on maintaining steady pacing and technique, earning a score of 0.8. The \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit is also relevant, as the session leverages music and rhythmic pacing to enhance the rowing experience, which aligns with dance and global hits music played, scoring 0.7.\n\nDespite the workout's outdoor setting in a body of water, the intensity level is low, and there is limited evidence of exploration or environmental challenges. Therefore, the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit is assigned a lower score of 0.4. The session does not emphasize elements typical of \"High-Energy & Intense,\" \"Soothing & Restorative,\" or \"Sport & Agility,\" thus these spirits are not included."
