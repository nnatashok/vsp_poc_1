  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'The Adrenaline Rush' due to its high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format and top intensity level (3 out of 3). These factors contribute to an unpredictable, high-energy workout experience, hence the score of 0.7. 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe is indicated by the playlist featuring dance remixes and upbeat tracks, suggesting a high-energy, music-driven atmosphere, giving it a score of 0.65. Furthermore, the format and mention of 'drive' (commonly related to competitive rowing drives) align with elements of 'The Competitor,' reflecting a structured and goal-oriented workout, hence a score of 0.6. The storytelling element ('Learn more about Prague through legends and myths narrated by Mac') offers a unique immersive quality but is secondary in dictating the primary vibe."
