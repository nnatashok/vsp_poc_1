Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is short at 10 minutes and 37 seconds, which inherently limits the overall energy expenditure, classifying it closer to 'Light'. The focus on core strengthening usually involves controlled, intense muscle engagement. However, the relatively brief session and absence of high-intensity cues justify a primary classification as 'Light' effort, with a small component of 'Moderate'.",
