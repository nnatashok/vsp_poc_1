  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 10:37 minutes and a focus on core Pilates, the workout likely has low energy expenditure typical of a Light effort difficulty, suited for foundational core exercises. The absence of intense exercises or high intervals suggests primarily low-intensity, sustaining the Light classification. However, core focus might demand sustained engagement, introducing some Moderate effort.",
