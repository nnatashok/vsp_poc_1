  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Meditative Grind' is chosen due to the rowing-based nature of the workout, which suggests a repetitive, endurance-focused experience despite the specified 'intervals'. The description mentions maintaining pace, which aligns with the meditative aspect rather than high-intensity output. The vibe 'The Endorphin Wave' is supported by the moderate intensity level and uplifting 80's and global hits music which may elevate energy and mood, consistent with a feel-good experience. Both vibes are appropriate given the balance of moderate intensity and playlist that encourages a steady yet energizing pace. Other high-intensity vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded due to lack of explicit high-motivation and intensity clues."
