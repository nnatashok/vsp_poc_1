  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is aptly classified as 'The Reboot Workout' with a score of 0.8. The emphasis on a 'cool-down' and 'mindfulness' in the workout description indicates a focus on deep stretch and total-body refreshment, typical of a reboot. The use of indie alternative and global hits music suggests a calming, relaxed atmosphere. The short duration (5 minutes 42 seconds) and the format being 'steady' align with a low-intensity session meant for rejuvenation.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Zen Flow' is a fitting vibe with a score of 0.7 as the workout involves a 'mindfulness cool-down', aligning with the grounding and breath-centered qualities of Zen practices.\n\nFinally, 'The Deep Recharge' receives a score of 0.6, given the implied nervous system reset from the gentle, cool-down format and the tranquil music choice. The keyword 'scan your body' supports an emphasis on gentle, restorative exercise. No high-intensity vibes were considered relevant due to the cool-down and relaxation elements."
