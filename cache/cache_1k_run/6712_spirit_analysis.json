  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under **Flow & Rhythm** due to its focus on Pilates, which is known for smooth, continuous movements emphasizing coordination and a mind-body connection. The quick 10-minute structure combined with music genres like Hip Hop/R&B Mid and Global Hits further supports this spirit, providing a rhythm-driven workout environment (score: 0.75).\n\nThe inclusion of Lucerne, Switzerland, as the location indicates an outdoor setting, which aligns with the **Outdoor & Adventure** spirit. This spirit is suitable for sessions recorded in natural outdoor environments, enhancing the adventurous and refreshing quality of the workout (score: 0.7).\n\nAdditionally, the workout might also involve elements of **Soothing & Restorative**, as Pilates often emphasizes core strengthening and gentle movement conducive to relaxation and recovery. However, the presence of upbeat music slightly reduces the likelihood of this being a predominant element (score: 0.5).\n\nOther potential spirits like High-Energy & Intense and Sport & Agility were not applicable due to the relaxed nature of Pilates and the lack of evidence for high athletic intensity levels."
