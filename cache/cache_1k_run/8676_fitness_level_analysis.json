  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is a warm-up lasting only 5:59 minutes, which is short and inherently low in intensity. It's designed to gradually raise the heart rate and prepare muscles for higher intensity work, thus qualifying as Light in terms of effort. The max rhythm of 24 and the focus on technique rather than hard effort further supports this classification.",
