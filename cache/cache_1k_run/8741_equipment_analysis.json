  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title 'Instructional: Achieving High Rhythms' and description emphasize building rhythm, which aligns with rowing techniques. The category explicitly includes 'row,' indicating a focus on rowing activity. Additionally, the image shows a rowing machine, confirming its relevance. Therefore, the rowing machine is essential for simulating water rowing to practice rhythm control. The confidence is very high at 0.9 due to the strong emphasis on rowing in both metadata and the visual evidence."
