  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified primarily under the 'Indoor rowing' category with a high confidence level of 0.9. The explicit mention of 'Club 26 Row' and phrases like 'Spend 5-minutes warming up, 20-minutes at a Sweat intensity' clearly indicate that this is a rowing workout. The format details such as 'Steady' and 'rhythm 26' further reinforce the focus on rowing cadence, which is typical for rowing machine workouts. The term 'sweat' implies a certain level of intensity which matches the indoor rowing category that includes vigorous exertion, albeit at moderate intensity (2 out of 3). The description of warming up, steady workout, and cooling down aligns with structured indoor rowing routines. No other potential categories fit as precisely given the emphasis on rowing equipment and terminology."
