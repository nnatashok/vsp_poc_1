  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Drive,standard,row', where row-based workouts typically range from Beginner to Intermediate in technique difficulty. Given the absence of specific complex movements and the nature of rowing becoming progressively more challenging with technique refinement rather than complexity, an Intermediate classification is more fitting, aligning with the 'Drive' label suggesting advanced understanding or effort, albeit commonly within rowing technique simplicity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout description indicates high-demand sprints and maximal effort finishes, with a 3/3 intensity level, suggesting substantial energy expenditure and little rest due to interval format, implying significant physical demand. Duration slightly over 16 minutes with a sprint focus supports a classification of Challenging to Extreme effort difficulty, particularly for individuals not regularly performing high-intensity rowing.",
