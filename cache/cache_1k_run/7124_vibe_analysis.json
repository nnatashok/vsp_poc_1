  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Steady State Row,\" emphasizing maintaining a steady rhythm. The description supports this by mentioning endurance building with a steady rhythm. The max rhythm of 24 strokes per minute and the 'steady' format strongly indicate a controlled, repetitive experience, aligning well with 'The Meditative Grind.' The intensity level is only 1 out of 3, further supporting a meditative, endurance-focused vibe. The music playlist includes Latin and Global Hits, which could introduce a more rhythmic element, justifying a secondary vibe of 'The Groove Session,' although this is a weaker match. The mixture of steady pacing and rhythmic music provides a combined experiential quality, but the primary focus remains on endurance and repetition."
