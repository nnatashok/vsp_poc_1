  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily a warm-up for rowing. The term 'warm-up' and the description suggest a gradual build-up of rhythm and effort, fitting 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to the repetitive and focused nature of rowing. The 'Max rhythm: 30' implies a steady pace. The music choice of 'Rock Mid-intensity, Global Hits' can create an uplifting and energizing atmosphere, which aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave' as it incorporates feel-good energy with steady movement. However, because it is a warm-up, the intensity might be lower than a typical endurance session, lowering the score for 'The Endorphin Wave.' The confidence is relatively high given the clear focus and purpose outlined in the metadata."
