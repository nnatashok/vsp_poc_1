  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'row', which generally means the Technique Difficulty is either Beginner or Intermediate. Given that the video title is 'Starting Line Row' and is part of the 'Breathe' category with an intensity of 1 out of 3, it suggests a focus on form and technique suitable for a beginner. The mention of jogging and running paces may introduce slight complexity, warranting a minimal score for Intermediate.",
