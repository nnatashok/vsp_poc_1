  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Zen Flow' was assigned a high score of 0.8 because the workout focuses on chest and shoulder opening, releasing tension and is described as a 'flow', all of which aligns well with a grounding and intentional practice typical of Zen Flow. The music playlist, featuring tracks that are chill and downtempo, further enhances the calm and focused vibe. The second vibe, 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse', received a score of 0.6 due to the overall music choice, which includes well-known and rhythmic songs that might influence a strong but fluid session. The flow type of workout inherently involves rhythmic movements, supporting this classification. Other vibes like 'The Groove Session' or 'The Meditative Grind' were not chosen because the metadata emphasizes flow and release of tension rather than fun or repetition."
