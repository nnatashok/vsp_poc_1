  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is classified under the 'row' category, which limits the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. The structure of holding a steady rhythm and incorporating sprints suggests that users need some coordination and familiarity with rowing. Therefore, it aligns more closely with the Intermediate level. The requirement for maintaining technique during both steady-state rowing and sprints implies a necessity for some technical understanding of rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's effort difficulty is demonstrated through the 'sweat' type and the interval structure of 3-minute steady-state rows interspersed with 30-second sprints. This combination suggests moderate to challenging intensity, implying medium energy expenditure. Given the workout's duration (21:28 minutes) and described 'intensity level: 2 out of 3', it reflects a higher effort compared to pure beginner workouts, thereby aligning with both moderate and challenging criteria for deconditioned users.",
