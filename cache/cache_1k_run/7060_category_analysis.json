  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout clearly classifies as 'Indoor rowing' based on the title 'Living Authentically Row' and keywords in the description and tags, such as 'celebratory row.' The reference to a 'max rhythm: 26' and 'Format: Interval' supports this, as it aligns with the interval rowing format typical of rowing workouts. The workout also mentions 'inclusivity' and a 'tribute to the transgender community,' which are thematic elements but do not alter the classification.\n\nThe workout's explicit labeling under categories 'Sweat,standard,row' in the metadata further strengthens the classification as it reinforces that rowing is central to the workout experience. With a workout intensity level of 2 out of 3, it confirms an intermediate intensity common in structured indoor rowing workouts.\n\nOther categories such as 'HIIT' or 'Mat' were considered due to interval format and potential mixed exercises but were excluded due to lack of explicit evidence beyond rowing-focused elements. The absence of traditional HIIT indicators or a mat component justifies this exclusion. Given these factors, 'Indoor rowing' receives a high score of 0.95 with high confidence at 0.9."
