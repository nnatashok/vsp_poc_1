  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Welcome to Seville Row' features rowing on a river as seen from the image, strongly indicating an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. This is supported by the description that emphasizes exploring Seville, suggesting an element of environmental interaction and discovery. The 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is assigned a score of 0.9 due to these clear indicators. \n\nThe workout also qualifies for a 'High-Energy & Intense' classification. It involves 1-minute intervals at max pressure and is a HIIT format with the highest intensity level (3 out of 3), pointing towards a high-energy experience. The energetic music playlist (e.g., songs like 'Bulletproof' and 'Good 4 U') underlines the intense effort, warranting a score of 0.8 for this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is somewhat present due to the rhythmic component of rowing and the music-driven aspect of the workout. However, it's less dominant compared to the other spirits, given the more structured and intense elements, resulting in a score of 0.5. Other potential spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Sport & Agility' are less relevant in this context."
