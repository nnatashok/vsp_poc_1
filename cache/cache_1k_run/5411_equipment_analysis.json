  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Signature Flow' and is categorized under 'On The Mat,' indicating a floor-based routine, likely involving fluid movements like yoga or pilates. The description invites participants to follow cues for a 'flow,' which typically implies a continuous sequence of poses. The image depicts a person practicing on a mat with yoga blocks visible as props. Therefore, a mat is essential for comfort and stability during floor exercises, and the blocks are likely used for support and to enhance flexibility. Hence, both the mat and blocks are included with high confidence scores."
