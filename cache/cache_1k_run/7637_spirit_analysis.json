  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Soothing & Restorative' (0.9) due to its purpose as a cool-down session, as explicitly stated in the workout name and description. The gentle pace with a max rhythm of 24 further indicates a relaxing and calming session aimed at recovery.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also strongly represented (0.8) because the workout takes place along Lake Tahoe. This natural outdoor setting, combined with the rowing activity, aligns well with the exploration and environment-focused aspect of this spirit.\n\nFinally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is given a moderate score (0.4). The inclusion of indie alternative and global hits music suggests a session with a subtle rhythmic flow, enhancing mind-body coordination despite the low intensity.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were not selected due to the workout's relaxing and recovery-focused nature, and the lack of competitive or high-energy elements. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit was also excluded because the session's gentle and understated format lacks strong technical or progressive training indicators."
