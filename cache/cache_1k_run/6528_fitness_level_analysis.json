Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of only about 6 minutes and the context of a 'Gentle Warm-Up', effort difficulty is primarily Light. The use of music genres like Dance mid and Global Hits also indicates a light to potentially moderate energy expenditure, but given the shorter duration and warm-up category, Light is more dominant. Moderate effort is slightly possible due to 'gradually build in effort and rhythm', but it remains secondary.",
