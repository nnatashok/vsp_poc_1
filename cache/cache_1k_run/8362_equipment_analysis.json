  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Gratitude Row\" and categorized under \"row,\" which strongly indicates the central use of a rowing machine. The \"Format: Climb\" and the workout being a \"series of intervals\" further suggest the use of a rowing machine, typical for such a workout style. The image supports rower usage, even though it appears to be outdoors; however, for this analysis, it's assumed to translate to a rowing machine. Given these details, there is very high confidence (1.0) that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
