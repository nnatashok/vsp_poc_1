  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'Indoor rowing' with high confidence due to several explicit cues in the metadata. The title 'Father's Day Row' clearly indicates a rowing workout. The description mentions maintaining pace through a series of intervals, which is a common structure in rowing workouts. The format is labeled as 'Intervals' and the category tags include 'row', directly pointing to an indoor rowing activity. Despite the tag 'sweat', which might suggest HIIT, the lack of explicit mention of high intensity or alternating intense segments with rest periods makes 'Indoor rowing' more appropriate. The moderate session duration of 16 minutes and the intensity level of 2 out of 3 further support this category as typical for a focused rowing workout. These indicators give 'Indoor rowing' a strong presence score of 0.95, reflecting its central defining characteristic in this session. Other workout categories are excluded due to the absence of indicators relevant to them."
