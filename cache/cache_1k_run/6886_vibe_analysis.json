  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Building Effort Warm-Up' suggests a gradual increase from light pressure to max effort, typical of a structured warm-up routine, aligning with a focus on building endurance and maintaining a repetitive flow, fitting 'The Meditative Grind' vibe (score: 0.7). The mention of intervals and increasing intensity touches on 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe due to the feel-good movement and steady build associated with the mix of Latin and Global Hits music (score: 0.6). The 5-minute duration and rhythmic max of 30 imply a gentle but continuous motion. Limited cues about intense exertion ruled out 'The Warrior Workout' or other high-intensity vibes."
