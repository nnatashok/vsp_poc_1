  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 16 minutes is relatively short, and the description labels it as a 'Beginner Flow,' implying low physical demand. Keywords like 'Chill mid' and 'Cool/Downtempo' for the music genre suggest a relaxed pace. There is no mention of high-intensity movements or short rest periods, supporting a Light effort difficulty classification, making it suitable even for very deconditioned users.",
