Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is 10 minutes and 47 seconds, which suggests a low to moderate intensity with possible short bursts of effort, indicated by the 'Moderate' score of 0.6. Resistance bands typically allow for control over the resistance, making the workout less energetically demanding than others, hence a 'Light' effort level is plausible (score 0.4). The emphasis is on building strength rather than high-intensity cardio, making this workout more suitable for those seeking moderate exertion, particularly given the playlist's mid-tempo pop genre.",
