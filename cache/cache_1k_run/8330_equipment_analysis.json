  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Twists Flow' and described as a flow focusing on opening the shoulders, chest, and back. This suggests a yoga or stretching routine. The category 'On The Mat' further confirms the use of a mat, as mats are commonly used for comfort and support in floor exercises and yoga practices. The image supports this by showing the individual performing a twist pose on a mat. Therefore, the confidence level for requiring a mat is very high at 0.9."
