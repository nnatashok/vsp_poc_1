  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is characterized by a circuit format ('Workout Type: circuit') and includes 'Upper Body + Core' focus, indicating targeted muscular engagement. The mention of 'Explicit lyrics' and a playlist with 'Latin, Global Hits' suggest a lively, energetic atmosphere, aligning with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit (score: 0.7). The 'Max rhythm: 24, Format: EMOM' indicates a methodical element, where exercises are performed in Every Minute On the Minute (EMOM), reflecting a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (score: 0.6). The duration of around 10 minutes on the mat suggests a condensed, efficient session rather than a soothing or restorative focus. Therefore, while energy and discipline are present, flows or restorative elements are not significant, leading to their exclusion in the classification."
