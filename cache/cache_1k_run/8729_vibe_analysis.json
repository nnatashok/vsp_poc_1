  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified for the workout is 'The Meditative Grind,' scored at 0.8. This is due to the 'breathe' nature of the workout, the long-distance rowing focus, and the repetitive pyramid structure. The low intensity (1 out of 3) further supports a meditative and endurance-focused vibe.\n\nThe 'Endorphin Wave' also fits with a score of 0.6. The gradual build-up through pyramids and the uplifting playlist featuring indie and global hits suggest a steady but energizing experience.\n\nLastly, 'The Zen Flow' is assigned a 0.5 score due to the outdoor setting in Newport Beach and the tranquil music genre, which implies a calming, breath-focused workout.\n\nThe term 'pyramid' along with the gradual progression of intensity, detracts from more explosive vibes like 'The Firestarter' or 'The Warrior Workout.' The lack of intense or combat-like structure excludes vibes like 'The Fight Camp' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.'"
