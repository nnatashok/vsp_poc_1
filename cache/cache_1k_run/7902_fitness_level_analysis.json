  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout category is 'row', restricting the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. The intermediate rhythm of max 28 and interval structure suggests some level of coordination is required, but not beyond an intermediate user. Thus, the workout fits predominantly within the Intermediate level, with some aspects being Beginner friendly due to the basic rowing nature.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is marked as 'sweat', and the intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicates a moderate level of physical demand. The 16-minute duration and interval format increase the effort slightly above light. As the workout includes upbeat, high-energy rock music, it suggests a higher engagement and effort level, making it moderate with elements of challenging effort.",
