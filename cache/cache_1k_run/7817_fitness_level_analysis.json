  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a rowing session categorized under 'sweat' and 'row', which suggests it may include moderate endurance and effort components typical of rowing activities. The interval format typically adds some complexity due to rhythm changes, but as this is a row-based workout, complexity remains limited, aligning primarily with the Beginner to Intermediate range per rule. The classification errs towards Beginner based on general simplicity of row mechanics, but includes Intermediate due to interval demands.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features a total duration of 31 minutes and involves interval training with both 4-minute and 45-second sets. Longer duration and varied interval length suggest some demand in terms of pacing and endurance. With a reported intensity level of 2 out of 3 and the primary workout being a 'sweat' category workout, it fits well into the Moderate level. Yet, the 30-stroke max rhythm could pose challenges for less fit users, also suggesting a slight Challenging aspect.",
