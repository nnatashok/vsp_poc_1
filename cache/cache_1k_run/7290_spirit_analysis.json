  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the description indicating 'ten sets of 1-minute high intensity intervals' and a 'workout intensity level' of 3 out of 3. The term 'HIIT' also suggests a fast-paced, demanding session designed for maximum effort. The music playlist, including energetic songs like 'The Final Countdown' and 'Good Vibrations,' reinforces this energy level. These elements justify a strong score of 0.9 for the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit.\\n\\nThe use of the location, 'Newport Beach', and the image showing an outdoor rowing environment strongly align with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit. The natural setting and water-based activity indicate exploration and use of outdoor elements, justifying the second classification with a score of 0.8. This setting differentiates it from a purely gym-based High-Intensity workout.\\n\\nOther spirits were not considered due to the lack of focus on rhythm (Flow & Rhythm), methodological progression (Structured & Disciplined), recovery (Soothing & Restorative), or sport-specific skills (Sport & Agility). The evidence strongly supports the selected spirits."
