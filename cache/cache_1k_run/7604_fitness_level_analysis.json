  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row' with 'standard' and 'sweat', which typically implies basic to moderately complex rowing movements. Given that \"row\" is inherently a simpler technique when following the Hydrow-specific progression model, it aligns with Beginner to Intermediate levels. The session is led without an instructor, which can demand more from users in terms of self-guidance and could increase the technique level to Intermediate for those unfamiliar with rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is an interval 'sweat' session, indicating a focus on elevated heart rate and energy expenditure. With the maximum rhythm capping at 28 strokes per minute in a 16-minute session, it involves substantial physical exertion, classifying the effort as Moderate. The workout intensity level set at 2 out of 3 points towards a Challenging level for users starting at low fitness levels, but the short duration suggests it\u2019s more Moderate overall.",
