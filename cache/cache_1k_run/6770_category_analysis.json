  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly labeled as 'Classical Pilates' both in the title and description, indicating it is focused on the Pilates exercise method. This is further reinforced by the tags and categories associated with the video such as 'On The Mat' which is commonly associated with mat-based Pilates exercises. Furthermore, the workout is described as a basic skill-building session of whole body exercises typical of Pilates. Music genre and playlist details suggest a contemporary, relaxed atmosphere which aligns with Pilates classes but do not significantly influence the categorization. The presence of actual Pilates terms and lack of equipment further confirm this categorization, leading to a very high confidence level of 0.95 for the Pilates category. Other potential categories such as Yoga or Stretching were not applicable since the exercise method here specifically targets Pilates routines."
