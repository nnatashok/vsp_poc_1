  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, \"Climbing Intervals Row,\" features a focus on technique during rowing intervals. This fits \"The Meditative Grind\" as it involves repetitive and focused exercise, with a strong score of 0.8 due to the emphasis on rhythm and climbing intervals. The use of Latin and Global Hits music playlists contributes to a steady, elevated energy, lending an \"Endorphin Wave\" vibe. This is scored at 0.6 because the workout is designed for an endurance climb rather than a sprint. Finally, the upbeat music selections such as \"Downtown\" and \"Ginza\" add a slight \"Nightclub Workout\" feel, given their lively tempo, though this is less dominant and receives a score of 0.4. Overall confidence is 0.79, based on strong indicators from the metadata."
