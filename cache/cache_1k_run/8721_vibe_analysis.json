  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Post-Row Mobility' is designed to stretch and refresh the body after rowing, fitting the profile of 'The Reboot Workout' with a score of 0.9. This vibe is categorized by gentle stretching and a focus on refreshing the body, which is indicated by the workout type 'mobility' and the description 'Stretch out your body after your row with Pete.' The short duration of 5 minutes and 39 seconds further implies a quick, refreshing session.\n\nThe music genre, consisting of 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' with remixes by artists like Kygo and Ti\u00ebsto, supports a relaxing yet upbeat vibe, aligning partially with 'The Zen Flow' which is grounding and breath-centered. The score of 0.7 reflects the use of popular, calming remixes that enhance a smooth, relaxing experience without emphasizing higher intensity movements.\n\nReferences to any dynamic or fast-paced music or workouts are notably absent, ruling out other, more intense workout vibes."
