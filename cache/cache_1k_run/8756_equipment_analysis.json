  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is clearly centered around rowing, as indicated by the title 'Training Row' and the repeated emphasis on rowing within the workout description, including Sera Moon's background with rowing and crew teams. The description mentions intervals, which is a common training format on rowing machines. Additionally, the category includes 'row', reinforcing the necessity of a rowing machine with very high confidence. The detailed connection to rowing in both Sera Moon's background and the workout type 'sweat' suggests that a rowing machine is indispensable for this session."
