  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"Flight Plan Row\" and described as taking on 30\" and 45\" intervals aligns strongly with the \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit. This is supported by the reference to HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) and an intensity level of 3 out of 3, indicating a vigorous and challenging session. The playlist, featuring energetic tracks like \"So What\" by P!nk and \"Greenlight\" by Flo Rida, further supports this classification.\n\nMoreover, the image shows the workout being conducted in an outdoor river setting, which aligns with the \"Outdoor & Adventure\" spirit. Rowing on natural water fits the element of exploration and environmental challenges. Despite the structured format, the outdoor context adds an adventurous layer to the workout.\n\nThe combination of these two spirits makes sense given the structure and intensity described, along with the outdoor image evidence, leading to a strong 0.9 confidence in the classification."
