  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'The Zen Flow' due to its calming and grounding nature. Key phrases such as 'gentle meters,' 'cool down,' and the location by 'Lake Tahoe' evoke a peaceful and intentional experience, further supported by indie alternative music which complements a tranquil vibe. 'The Meditative Grind' is also applicable, as the activity involves repetitive rowing with an emphasis on longevity and adding meters, resonating well with a steady and repetitive workout theme. Lastly, 'The Reboot Workout' is relevant, albeit to a lesser extent (score 0.5), as the workout serves as a cool-down to refresh the body and mind, aligning with the low-intensity, restorative nature. Other vibes were excluded due to the lack of intensity or competitive elements."
