Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 20-minute duration and the high-energy music choice like 'Dance mid' and 'Global Hits' indicate a heightened energy expenditure typical of HIIT workouts, leading to a Moderate (0.75) effort difficulty with a potential for being Challenging (0.4) for less fit users. The lack of long rest periods and continuous movement further supports this classification within the physical demands of HIIT.",
