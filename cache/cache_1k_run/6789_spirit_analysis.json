  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative.' The title and description explicitly mention a 'gentle restorative practice,' indicating that the workout is designed for relaxation and recovery. The category, 'restore,' and chill, downtempo music also support this classification, making it a strong match with a score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the location of the workout at the 'Royal Palm Estate in Miami,' as seen in the image, indicates an outdoor environment. Therefore, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant, particularly since the session is 'on-the-mat' in a natural setting. While it's not as strong as the primary restorative spirit, it still merits a score of 0.7 due to the clear natural setting and environment focus."
