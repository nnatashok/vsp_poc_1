Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration of 5 minutes and 40 seconds suggests a low overall energy expenditure, typical for a warm-up. The format being 'interval' and inclusion of power strokes slightly elevates physical demand above basic warm-up levels, making Moderate a feasible secondary score, but Light remains primary given duration and warm-up intent.",
