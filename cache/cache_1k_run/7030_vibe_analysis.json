  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Pyramid HIIT Row' features a high-intensity format with a rating of 3 out of 3, indicating a demanding and challenging session that aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe. The use of rock mid-intensity and global hits, including energetic tracks like 'Continuous Thunder' and 'Cum On Feel The Noize', further supports this classification with a score of 0.8.\n\nThe short duration (11 minutes and 25 seconds) and the pyramid format suggest a focused, explosive session typical of 'The Firestarter' vibe, earning it a score of 0.7.\n\nAdditionally, the rowing component and repetitive nature suggest elements of 'The Meditative Grind', where consistency and focus are key, thereby scoring 0.6. The absence of an instructor hints at a more self-directed, personal intensity characteristic of meditative workouts. The presence of pyramid HIIT, specific music choices, and the format verified by metadata contribute to this confident classification."
