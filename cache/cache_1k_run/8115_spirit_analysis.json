  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Post-Row Stretch' with a focus on loosening 'hip flexors, back, and side body' suggests a Soothing & Restorative spirit, aimed at recovery and relaxation. The short duration of 5 minutes and 35 seconds further emphasizes its purpose as a gentle, post-workout activity. The use of stretching and its categorization under 'On The Mat' aligns with this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the setting 'along the shores of Norway' and the image showing an outdoor environment strongly indicate an Outdoor & Adventure spirit. The natural backdrop enhances the experience with a connection to nature.\n\nWhile the music from artists like Maya Jane Coles and St. Germain might add a rhythmic element, the primary focus on recovery and the natural setting lead to the exclusion of other spirits such as High-Energy & Intense or Structured & Disciplined. Overall, the combination of restorative stretching in a scenic location solidifies the assigned spirits."
