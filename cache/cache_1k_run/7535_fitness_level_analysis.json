  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', which generally involves repetitive, low-complexity movements. Given the format 'Power' and focus on 'control your power output' and 'gradually increase speed,' some coordination is required, aligning it with an Intermediate rating. However, rowing itself is a technically simpler activity, thus retaining a strong alignment with Beginner technique as well.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is driven by an 11-minute duration and a max rhythm of 28, which suggests a steady pace with bursts of effort. The workout is classified under 'sweat' and 'power', indicating a significant, though controlled energy output. With an intensity level of 2 out of 3, the effort likely surpasses 'Light' but does not fully reach 'Challenging', aligning closely with 'Moderate', and potentially 'Challenging' for less fit users.",
