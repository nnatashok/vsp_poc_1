  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'drive', which according to Hydrow-specific rules aligns with Advanced technique difficulty. However, since the workout is rowing-based and involves intervals, the movements are likely to require some coordination and rhythm, making an intermediate level more appropriate while still aligning under the 'drive' rule.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the 21-minute duration and the high intensity rating (3 out of 3), combined with interval training that demands shifts in effort and rhythm, the effort difficulty is strong. The use of high-tempo music suggests a pace designed to push physical limits, making it demanding for less fit users.",
