  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Chicago Connection Row' combines high-intensity rowing intervals with upbeat music. The inclusion of 'HIIT' and a max rhythm of 32 suggests a strong, primal energy and intense drive fitting 'The Warrior Workout' vibe. The use of dance and global hits music, highlighted by songs like 'Ain't Nobody' and 'Good Life', aligns with 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe, creating an energetic and fun atmosphere. The focus on rowing and interval training connects with 'The Meditative Grind' due to the repetition and sustained focus required, though the shorter duration limits this association. The combination of these elements provides a confident vibe classification."
