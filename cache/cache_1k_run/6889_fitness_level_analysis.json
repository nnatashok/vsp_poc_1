Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty reflects a workout duration of nearly 21 minutes, which is moderate for bodyweight exercises, emphasizing stabilization and total muscle engagement. The absence of rest periods, combined with the instructional setting, suggests consistent pace, raising effort above Light. The music selection, specifically dance and global hits, might drive a steady, motivating tempo. This aligns with Moderate Difficulty (score 0.65), but the presence of an Olympic-level coach suggests it could be more engaging and rise to Challenging for less fit users (score 0.35).",
