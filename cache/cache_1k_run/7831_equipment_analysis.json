  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly categorized as 'row' under its metadata and titled 'Cardio Intervals Row', indicating a high confidence that the rowing machine is central to the workout. The category 'Sweat,standard,row' and the description mentioning 'intervals shifting in rhythm' strongly imply the use of a rowing machine for interval training. The image supports this as it shows rowing equipment, aligning with the workout's focus."
