  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is 20 minutes, a moderate length that doesn't suggest extremely high physical exertion. While labeled 'advanced', the energy demands primarily relate to maintaining tension and endurance intrinsic to Pilates rather than intense cardio or heavy lifting. The pace could contribute to increased effort, but Pilates lacks the high-intensity characteristics seen in HIIT or circuit training, so an effort level of 'Moderate' with a high alignment score is justified.",
