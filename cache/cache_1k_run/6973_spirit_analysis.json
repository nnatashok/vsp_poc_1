  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Miami Beach Warm-Up,' strongly suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit due to the setting and the nature-based aspect. The presence of water in the image further supports this classification (score: 0.8). Additionally, the description mentions \"climb from a rhythm 22 to 26,\" indicating elements of 'Flow & Rhythm' with a focus on maintaining a set pace and rhythm during the row. The music playlist featuring Latin and Global Hits reinforces the rhythmic and engaging nature of the workout (score: 0.7). The session is described as a warm-up, suggesting a moderate level of intensity, hence not fitting 'High-Energy & Intense.' The lack of technical detail points away from 'Structured & Disciplined.' The overall lighthearted, music-driven approach fits best with the two chosen spirits."
