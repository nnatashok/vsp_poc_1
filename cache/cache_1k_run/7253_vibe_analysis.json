  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Hero Pose Restorative Yoga' has a strong focus on restorative and chest-opening poses, as indicated by the keywords 'restorative yoga' and 'improve posture.' This aligns very well with 'The Zen Flow,' which emphasizes grounding, intentional, and breath-centered movements, earning it a score of 0.9.\n\nThe use of the term 'restore' and the calming music genre of 'Chill low, Cool/Downtempo' aligns with 'The Reboot Workout,' which focuses on low-stress and refreshing movements, hence a score of 0.7.\n\nLastly, 'The Deep Recharge' is relevant due to the mention of 'hero pose,' a relaxing and restorative position, implying an ultra-gentle movement, justifying a score of 0.6. The short duration makes other intense vibes less applicable and the calming outdoor setting further supports these classifications."
