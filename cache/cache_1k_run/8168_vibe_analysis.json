  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Legs-Focused Warm-Up' suggesting a preparatory routine, likely featuring repetitive, focused movements typical of 'The Meditative Grind.' This classification is supported by the \"technique-focused\" description, which indicates a controlled and intentional approach, fitting this vibe with a score of 0.7. Additionally, the emphasis on technique aligns with 'The Masterclass Workout,' emphasizing skill-building and precision in movements, deserving a score of 0.6. The uplifting and popular Indie Alternative and Global Hits music genres enhance the meditative quality, though the absence of high intensity or explicit skill mastery indicators keeps the confidence level moderate at 0.75. Other potential vibes, like 'The Comfort Moves' and 'The Reboot Workout,' were less suitable due to the lack of explicit gentle or restorative elements."
