  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Team Intervals Row' involves power intervals and high-intensity intervals, which suggests a competitive and intense experience, aligning well with 'The Competitor' vibe. The mention of 'power intervals' and a maximum rhythm of 34 indicates a focus on explosive energy and teamwork, further enhancing this vibe. \n\nThe playlist, featuring energetic songs from artists like Imagine Dragons and The Offspring, underscores a high-adrenaline atmosphere, which is consistent with 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe. The mix of indie alternative and global hits supports an electrifying environment driving the workout experience.\n\nThe session duration of around 21 minutes and the interval format also fit with 'The Meditative Grind,' as it involves sustained effort over a longer period, promoting rhythm and focus. However, the high-intensity nature scales it down to a 0.6 score since it\u2019s less about zoning out than maintaining intense focus.\n\nOther vibes were excluded due to insufficient alignment with the competitive and intense nature of the workout."
