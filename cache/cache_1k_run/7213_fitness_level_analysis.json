Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a short duration of just 5 minutes and 43 seconds, which typically indicates a lower energy expenditure. Being a warm-up, rather than a main workout, it is designed to prepare the body gently, aligning with a Light effort difficulty. The music played is mid-intensity, which might slightly increase the tempo, suggesting a slight case for Moderate effort difficulty with a low score. Overall, the short duration and the context of warming up strongly support a Light classification, giving it a score of 0.9.",
