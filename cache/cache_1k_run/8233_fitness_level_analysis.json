  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Although the workout uses a rowing machine typically suggesting Beginner to Intermediate technique demand, the 'sweat' workout type implies a moderate complexity. Given the lack of complex movements associated with rowing and the emphasis on rhythm and foundational training, this leans more towards Beginner (0.7), though with some Intermediate elements (0.3).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The use of intervals and the max rhythm of 34 indicate a need for energy expenditure characteristic of a 'Moderate' effort (0.75), suitable for challenging those less fit. However, the duration being under 20 minutes and interval-based does introduce brief periods of heightened intensity, suggesting a minor Challenging component (0.25).",
