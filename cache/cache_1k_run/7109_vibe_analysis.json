  "vibesExplanation": "The chosen vibes for this workout are 'The Zen Flow' and 'The Meditative Grind'. The workout's focus on 'alignment' and 'sun salutations' suggests a grounding, intentional practice, aligning strongly with 'The Zen Flow'. The music described as 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' further supports this vibe by providing a calming, unhurried atmosphere. The use of the term 'align' and traditional yoga sequence like sun salutations also indicate elements of repetition and meditative qualities, aligning moderately with 'The Meditative Grind'. The lack of intense or fast-paced descriptors in the metadata reduces the likelihood of more vigorous vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout'. Overall, high confidence (0.85) is based on clear evidence from the workout's description and musical context."
