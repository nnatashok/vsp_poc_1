  "categoriesExplanation": "The category 'Yoga' was chosen with a score of 0.8 due to the workout's emphasis on a 'hip-opening flow' and reference to being led through a 'flow.' The terminology 'flow' is commonly associated with yoga practices, specifically those involving sequences of movements designed to improve flexibility and joint health, which aligns with the concept of hip-opening sequences. Additionally, the tranquil music selection and location at the 'Royal Palm Estate in Miami' contribute to the relaxed, meditative atmosphere often present in yoga sessions.\nThe category 'Stretching' is assigned a score of 0.6 because the workout is clearly focused on flexibility and mobility, indicated by 'gently open your hips.' Stretching is typically a key component of easing tension and enhancing joint flexibility, which matches this description. \nOther categories such as 'Pilates' or 'Mat' were considered, but 'Yoga' and 'Stretching' are more prominent due to the specific emphasis on flow and relaxation-related elements in the metadata."
