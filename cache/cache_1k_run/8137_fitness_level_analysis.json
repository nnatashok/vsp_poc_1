  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is categorized as 'drive' and 'row', which typically involves rowing movement complex enough to be classified between Beginner and Intermediate. Hydrow-specific rule asserts 'Drive' to increase difficulty and drive workouts can be considered having techniques near the advanced level. However, considering row specification, the primary technique difficulty categorization aligns best with Intermediate due primarily to the rhythmic and power aspects of rowing.",

This intensity and focus on power drive up the effort difficulty, making it challenging. The power-focused format, and the descriptor 'for maximum meters', further support the classification of challenging to extreme.",
