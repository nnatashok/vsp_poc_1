  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts over 20 minutes and focuses on core and lower body exercises which increases energy demand, suitable for a 'Moderate' effort level for less conditioned users. The descriptors like 'feel the burn' suggest significant engagement, hinting at a modest 'Challenging' intensity. However, as a bodyweight routine without equipment, it likely resides mostly in the 'Moderate' range.",
