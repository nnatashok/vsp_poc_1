  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 20 minutes long, which is moderate in duration. Combined with the description of working the core and lower body, this suggests a low-to-medium intensity workout level. The music choices such as Dance mid and Global Hits typically accompany a rhythm that may encourage more active engagement but within manageable bounds, especially with no additional weight or complex choreography involved. Altogether, this results in a moderate energy expenditure suitable for individuals ranging from deconditioned beginners to slightly more conditioned individuals.",
