  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Meditation Cool-Down,' strongly suggests a calming and grounding experience, aligning with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The description emphasizes tuning into 'mind and body,' which is indicative of a slow, intentional, and breath-centered approach. The term 'cool down' and minimal rhythmic pace imply relaxation and winding down, supporting the 0.8 score for 'The Zen Flow.'\n\nThe 'Steady' format and repetitive nature of rowing contribute to a meditative state, suggesting elements of 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.6. However, the short duration and music described as 'Pop low, Global Hits' may slightly detract from pure meditation and consistency, limiting the score for 'The Meditative Grind.'\n\nOther potential vibes such as 'The Reboot Workout' were not considered due to the lack of emphasis on deep stretching or mobility drills typically associated with that vibe."
