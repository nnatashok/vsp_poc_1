  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is strongly characterized as an Indoor Rowing session due to references to 'power down the Hillsborough River' and the categorization under 'row' in the provided metadata. The inclusion of rowing-specific language and lack of any other equipment further supports this classification, warranting a high score of 0.9 for the 'Indoor rowing' category. The workout is also described as 'HIIT-style' with a 'Workout intensity level: 3 out of 3,' which are explicit indicators of a High-Intensity Interval Training session. The mention of 'HIIT' format in both the title and description, along with the intensity level, supports its categorization, leading to a score of 0.8 for 'HIIT'. Other categories such as 'Mat' or 'Pilates' were not considered due to the specific focus on rowing and high-intensity intervals, making these two the most fitting categories."
