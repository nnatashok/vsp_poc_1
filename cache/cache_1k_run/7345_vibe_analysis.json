  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Technique Cool-Down' primarily focuses on breaking down the rowing stroke, which aligns with 'The Masterclass Workout' given its emphasis on technique and skill-building. The use of specific rowing techniques under a controlled rhythm suggests a strong match. The inclusion of a cool-down implies a relaxation and refreshment aspect, connecting to 'The Reboot Workout,' facilitating recovery after more intense sessions. The setting by the Charles River, combined with the calm music genres (Pop low, Global Hits) and the calming influence of a natural setting, correlates with 'The Zen Flow,' offering a grounding and rhythmic experience. Absence of high intensity or competitive aspects excludes the high-energy vibes, justifying the emphasis on technique and relaxation."
