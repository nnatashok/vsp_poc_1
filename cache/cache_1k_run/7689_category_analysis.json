  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is described as 'Flow + Restore', suggesting elements of flowing movements typically found in yoga practices. The description further mentions 'grounding yourself through restorative poses', which is a strong indicator of both restorative yoga and stretching exercises. 'Flow' and 'restorative poses' clearly align with yoga terminology, hence the high score for the Yoga category. \n\nThe metadata mentions this is an 'On The Mat' workout, reinforcing the likelihood of yoga or mat-based stretching exercises. The score for Stretching is moderate as the term 'restorative poses' can often encompass gentle stretching to promote relaxation. \n\nThe lack of intense activity indicators, the calming playlist with 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' music genre, and the focus on flow and restoration reduce the likelihood of this being a more strenuous or dynamic workout, ruling out categories like Pilates or HIIT. The overall calm and restorative focus drives a strong confidence level of 0.8 for this classification."
