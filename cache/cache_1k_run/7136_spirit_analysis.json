  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is clearly centered around a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, highlighted by the title 'Finding Breath and Stillness Restore' and the description focusing on breathing and restorative practice. This indicates a strong emphasis on relaxation and recovery, supported by the use of the term 'restore' and 'restorative.' Additionally, the music from genres like 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' suggests a calming environment.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is considered with a lower score as the exercise may involve a continuous, mindful movement as implied by the phrase 'feel your breath in each pose,' potentially suggesting a gentle pacing or flow between positions. However, the primary focus remains on restoration and calming practices, which is why this spirit is secondary with a moderate score.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Outdoor & Adventure,' 'Sport & Agility,' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded as there is no indication of high intensity, structure, or outdoor elements."
