  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Total Body Bootcamp' is classified under 'The Warrior Workout' vibe with a score of 0.7. The use of terms like 'build strength and balance' and 'whole body bootcamp' suggest a challenging, strength-focused session typical of the Warrior Workout vibe. The duration of 21 minutes implies an intense but manageable session, which aligns with strength-based bootcamp workouts aiming for primal energy and intensity.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe is also relevant with a score of 0.6. The playlist includes upbeat pop and global hits, such as 'Firestone' by Kygo and 'Something Big' by Shawn Mendes, which provide a strong, fluid beat-driven atmosphere. This musical selection supports a feel of strong but fluid movement found in Rhythmic Powerhouse workouts.\n\nThe absence of specified equipment and the 'On The Mat' category suggest a focus on body-weight exercises, enhancing both vibes' applicability. Though no extreme elements are highlighted, the combination of music and workout style supports these classifications."
