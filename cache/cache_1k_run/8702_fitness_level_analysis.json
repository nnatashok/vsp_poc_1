  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is relatively short at 10:40, and it's a mobility session, which typically involves stretching and controlled movements aimed at improving flexibility. The lack of additional equipment and the focus on hip mobility imply low energy expenditure and gentle activity, framing this as a light effort workout suitable for beginners. Thus, the classification receives a Light difficulty score of 1.0 due to the minimal energy demands and fit with the described session type.",
