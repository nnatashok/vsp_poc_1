  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Spicy Warm-Up' appears to embody a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the continuous movement in a rowing context combined with music-driven pacing. Songs like 'Domino' by Jessie J and 'Get Right' by Jennifer Lopez suggest a rhythm-focused session. The interval format with a rhythm max of 28+ implies a structured yet flowing session, supporting a score of 0.7.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' element is represented by the frequent \"five stroke sprint\" mentioned in the description, indicating bursts of maximum effort, which fits with energetic pop hits. Hence, a moderate score of 0.6 is warranted.\n\nLastly, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is somewhat present as this workout was recorded on a river, as indicated by the image of rowing outdoors. This aligns with environmental engagement, giving it a score of 0.5.\n\nThe classification is based on the metadata and visuals but excludes 'Structured & Disciplined' due to the playful and spontaneous nature described in the interval cues, as well as 'Soothing & Restorative' given the workout's focus on energy and rhythm rather than relaxation."
