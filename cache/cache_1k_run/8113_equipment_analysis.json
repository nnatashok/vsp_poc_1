  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row' under the category type, which explicitly indicates that a rowing machine is needed. Additionally, the workout name 'Cross Training Row' and the description emphasizing different rhythms further suggest that rowing is the primary activity. Therefore, the confidence level for requiring a rowing machine is very high (1.0). No other equipment is mentioned or implied, so only the rowing machine is listed as required equipment."
