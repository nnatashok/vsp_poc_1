  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'cool down' lasting under 6 minutes, indicating a minimal effort requirement. The purpose is to mindfully conclude exercise, invariably low in energy expenditure, suitable for all fitness levels, especially beginners. The lack of intensity cues and the nature of the activity suggest a light effort overall. A slight consideration for Moderate difficulty exists due to the inclusion of rowing and rhythm elements, yet these factors are secondary in a cool down context.",
