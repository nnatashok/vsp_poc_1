  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive', which is a specific Hydrow classification indicating a higher level of technical demand, typically beyond basic rowing. For Hydrow, 'drive' workouts generally fall into Intermediate or Advanced Technique Difficulties. However, given the primary classification guideline for row-based workouts, such activities can only reach an Intermediate level at most. The workout involves accumulating meters with a focus on 'power', requiring some degree of coordination and form, fitting the Intermediate classification strongly, at a score of 0.8, with high confidence.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout, with a duration of 11:28 minutes, falls under a 'drive' type, which typically suggests high intensity. The maximum rhythm of 32 and the power format imply significant physical exertion. With an instructor noted for making participants work hard, and an intensity level at 3 out of 3, the energy expenditure is substantial. As such, the effort difficulty is assessed as Challenging, scoring 0.75, as this workout pushes participants especially in terms of maintaining power and rhythm over a relatively short duration, suitable for those with more than basic conditioning, aligning with high confidence.",
