Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 10 minutes and 33 seconds long, focusing on hip mobility, which implies a gentle approach aimed at flexibility rather than cardiovascular or muscular endurance. The terminology 'gently open up your hips' suggests a low energy expenditure session, suitable for those who are in poorer physical shape. No high-intensity elements or aerobic exercises are mentioned, aligning closely with a 'Light' effort classification.",
