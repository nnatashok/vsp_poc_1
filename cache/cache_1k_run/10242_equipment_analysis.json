  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata indicates that the workout is part of a 'Drop Your Split Row' series, explicitly focusing on rowing. The terms 'Drop Your Split', 'Row', and the details about stroke rates (s/m) strongly suggest an emphasis on rowing techniques and performance. This aligns with the category mentioning 'row', which typifies rowing workouts. Though no equipment is listed in the 'Equipment' section, the context and category imply the use of a rowing machine. The image further supports this by showing a rowing activity, confirming that a rowing machine is central to the workout, justifying a confidence score of 0.9."
