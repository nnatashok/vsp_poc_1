  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata indicates a strong emphasis on rowing: the workout name 'All in One + Club 26 Row' and the 'row' category both explicitly mention rowing. Additionally, the format 'Steady' and descriptions like 'Spend 5-minutes warming up, 20-minutes at a Sweat intensity' align with typical structured rowing workouts. Therefore, a rowing machine is identified as required with very high confidence (0.9). The imagery of rowing in a watercraft suggests rowing as a core focus, further reinforcing the necessity of a rowing machine for this workout."
