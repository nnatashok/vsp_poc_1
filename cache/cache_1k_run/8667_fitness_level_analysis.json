  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'row' under Hydrow-specific rules, limiting technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The lack of complex movements and the 'jog pace' description suggest the rowing technique required is straightforward. The pyramid format and focus on patience and resiliency slightly raise the complexity but not beyond Intermediate. Based on this, the Beginner level aligns strongly (score: 0.8) with minor alignment to Intermediate (score: 0.2).",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of over 31 minutes at a 'jog pace' in a pyramid format suggests moderate energy expenditure. The intensity level is indicated as 1 out of 3, aligning with low-to-medium intensity efforts typical of 'Moderate' classification. Pyramid workouts typically require building and tapering effort, bumping the scale slightly towards 'Challenging'. Therefore, it's primarily moderate (score: 0.7) with some characteristics of challenging effort (score: 0.3).",
