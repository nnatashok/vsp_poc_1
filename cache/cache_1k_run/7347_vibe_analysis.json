  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is described as a warm-up focused on refining stroke technique, suggesting deliberate, repetitive movement, aligning with the vibe 'The Meditative Grind.' This association is backed by the max rhythm of 28, which indicates a steady, controlled pace. The emphasis on technique indicates a strong alignment with 'The Masterclass Workout,' which is focused on skill-building and precision, justifying a high score of 0.8.\n\nThe playlist consists of mid-tempo pop and global hits, suggesting a lighter, more relaxed energy, lending some support to the 'The Reboot Workout,' though it's less about relaxation and more about technique refinement, justifying a lower score of 0.4 for this vibe. The presence of highly specific technique focus excludes stronger explosive or high-intensity vibes."
