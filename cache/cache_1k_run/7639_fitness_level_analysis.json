Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 16 minutes and 24 seconds, which is relatively short, coupled with the 'beginner friendly' description and lack of specified intense movements, supports a classification of Light effort. The use of chill music genres like 'Chill mid' and 'Cool/Downtempo' implies a relaxed atmosphere, further indicating low intensity. However, given the potential for a slightly elevated heart rate from minor flows, a minor score is given to the Moderate category.",
