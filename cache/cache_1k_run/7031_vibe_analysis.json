  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified predominantly as \"The Rhythmic Powerhouse\" due to the dance and global hits music genre, which suggests a beat-driven and music-infused session. The focus on bodyweight strength with elevated heart rate aligns with \"The Warrior Workout,\" as it involves building strength with intensity, even though it's not extremely heavy. The 20-minute duration and elevated heart rate contribute to \"The Endorphin Wave,\" which involves steady energy and feel-good movement. There is moderate confidence in these classifications given the lack of explicit music genre and instructor insight."
