  "vibesExplanation": "The workout's emphasis on maintaining a consistent split and using intervals aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind.' The focus is on controlled, repetitive motion, which resonates with the description of zoning in and letting repetition take over. This is supported by the low workout intensity level and the 'breathe' category, indicating a steady, endurance-focused session. The use of rock and global hits music adds an energetic but steady rhythm, boosting the workout's engaging quality, resulting in a high confidence score of 0.8 for this vibe. Additionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is also relevant due to the upbeat, motivating nature of songs by artists like Bon Jovi and Twisted Sister, suggesting a feel-good energy and a steady build in intensity. This earns it a score of 0.6, capturing a less intense but still uplifting experience. Other vibes were excluded due to the workout's non-explosive, non-competitive approach."
