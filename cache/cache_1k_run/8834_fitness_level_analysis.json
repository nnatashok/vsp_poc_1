  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout category is 'row', which allows for a maximum technique difficulty of Intermediate, we assign Beginner technique difficulty since rowing, even with a 'climb' format, generally involves straightforward movements primarily dependent on proper rowing form. The Olympian instructor suggests excellent guidance, making it accessible to beginners. Hence, there's a strong alignment with Beginner and a moderate possibility for Intermediate for those new to rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a 31-minute duration, the workout demands a consistent effort, and the 'climb' format implies a gradual increase in intensity. However, the stated workout intensity is 1 out of 3, indicating a low-intensity level. This supports a Light effort classification with a moderate alignment towards Moderate if the participant is very deconditioned. The Pop low and Global Hits radio genres likely offer a motivational but not overwhelming pace.",
