  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Club 18 Row' is characterized by several key elements that align with specific spirits. First, the emphasis on 'efficiency' and 'staying at a rhythm 18' suggests a focus on maintaining consistent, smooth movement patterns, which fits well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.75). The music choice, featuring smooth pop and global hits, along with intervals, reinforces this connection by promoting a rhythmic flow.\n\nThe low 'Workout intensity level' (1 out of 3) and category 'breathe' indicate a calm, restorative focus, aligning with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit (score: 0.65). The emphasis on breathing and a meditative approach to rowing contribute to this classification.\n\nThe visual context, showing rowing on a river, naturally fits the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (score: 0.80), reflecting nature-based elements and exploration associated with this environment. The outdoor setting provides an adventurous flair even within a structured workout.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were not chosen due to the workout's lower intensity and focus on rhythm and breathing."
