Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 21 minutes in length and the description 'heat-building flow' implies a mild increase in energy expenditure. Given the 'flow' type and on-the-mat category, the effort difficulty is primarily Light as it focuses on sustaining effort through steady movements rather than high-intensity bursts. The playlist suggests a calm, steady tempo. Therefore, Light is scored at 0.6 with a Moderate element at 0.4 for increased core engagement.",
