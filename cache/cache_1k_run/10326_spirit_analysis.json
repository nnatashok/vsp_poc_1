  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as High-Energy & Intense (score: 0.75) due to terms like 'strengthen your legs and glutes,' '20-minute circuit workout,' and 'challenge their limits,' indicating a fast-paced and vigorous session aimed at building endurance and cardio. \"Structured & Disciplined\" is a strong fit (score: 0.65) because of the circuit format, use of dumbbells, and named exercises like reverse lunges and goblet squats, which require following a specific plan and technique. The inclusion of rowing bursts on the Hydrow also suggests organized segments. Lastly, Outdoor & Adventure (score: 0.5) is considered since the workout is filmed in Charleston's historic Navy shipyard, providing a scenic backdrop that adds an adventurous element, though the main action is on the mat indoors."
