  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled 'Sunset Cool-Down' indicates a relaxing and unwinding session. The description highlights rowing at sunset with a steady rhythm, suggesting a calm, meditative environment. The music genre, featuring Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s blues/jazz tracks, aligns with a chill, soothing vibe, enhancing the calmness of the session. \n\n'The Zen Flow' is the most suitable vibe due to the grounding, intentional, and breath-centered aspects implied by the evening timing and cool-down nature (score: 0.9). This is reinforced by the calming and smooth nature of jazz and blues music, creating a relaxed ambiance conducive to mindfulness.\n\n'The Reboot Workout' is also relevant as it signifies a low-stress, total-body refresh through gentle movement, particularly given the short duration and focus on unwinding after a workout (score: 0.8). The calm, restorative aesthetic of rowing at sunset supports recovery and relaxation."
