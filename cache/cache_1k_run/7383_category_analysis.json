  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout 'Sprint + Max Interval Row' is identified as 'Indoor rowing' with a high confidence score of 0.8 due to explicit references to rowing in the name and description ('row', 'intervals'). Additionally, the metadata lists 'row' under the Workout Type and Category fields. The 'HIIT' category is also assigned with a score of 0.6 as the description mentions 'intervals', specifically '2-minute and 1-minute intervals', and an intensity level of 3 out of 3, indicating a high-intensity workout format. The inclusion of terms like 'max pace', 'sprint', and the maximum rhythm also support the HIIT classification. Other categories such as 'Mat', 'Elliptical', or 'Indoor biking' are not applicable due to the clear focus on rowing and interval training."
