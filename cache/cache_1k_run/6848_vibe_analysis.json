  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Welcome to LA Power Flow' is identified with 'The Zen Flow' (0.7) due to its emphasis on energizing movement and the beachfront location, which suggests a grounding and breath-centered experience. The use of flow aligns with controlled and intentional movements typical of Zen-like activities. \n\n'Groove Session' (0.6) matches due to the music genre featuring chill and downtempo tracks, suggesting a fun and expressive element. The selection of songs, like 'Dream' and 'Sunlight,' indicates a fluid and satisfying experience focused on feeling the music.\n\n'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' (0.5) fits as well due to the beat-driven nature of the playlist, including tracks with a strong rhythmic component like 'Rojo' and 'Pressure.' These tracks add a musically infused strength to the session, blending power with smooth flow.\n\nThe classification leans away from high-intensity vibes due to the flow type and moderate playlist energy."
