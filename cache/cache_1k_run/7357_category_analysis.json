  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is categorized primarily as 'Indoor rowing' due to explicit references in the metadata, such as terms like 'row', 'cool-down with Mac', and the description being linked to a rowing session. The format 'Steady' and 'Max rhythm: 22' indicate a measured, controlled activity common in rowing, particularly in a cool-down phase after a rowing workout. Considering the low-intensity, cool-down nature of the workout, 'Stretching' is a secondary category but with a low score, as cool-down sessions generally incorporate elements like stretching to ease muscles after exercise. The presence of non-specific cool-down elements suggests a minimal indirect connection to stretching, justifying a supplemental but limited classification in that category."
