  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'drive' in Hydrow indicates a focus on power and advanced rowing techniques. 'Drive' workouts are categorized as Advanced due to complex rowing techniques that require coordination and rhythm, reflected in the max rhythm of 32. Although the primary category is 'row', the 'drive' specificity elevates the complexity above simple rowing, hence a strong identification with Advanced but also some overlap with Intermediate for experienced rowers who can handle more intensive pacing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration of 11 minutes and 20 seconds is counterbalanced by the HIIT format, which involves high-intensity intervals. An intensity level of 3 out of 3 and the demanding rhythm (max 32) contribute to the Challenging categorization. Given the potential for significant energy expenditure in HIIT rowing drills, there's also partial alignment with Extreme effort difficulty, especially in intervals designed for experienced users, though overall duration prevents full classification as Extreme.",
