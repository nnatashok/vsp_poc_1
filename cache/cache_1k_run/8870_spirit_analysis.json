  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.79 because it emphasizes a steady pace and rhythm with a maximum stroke rate of 22, suggesting a smooth and continuous movement pattern. Additionally, the music genres 'Pop low' and 'Global Hits' support a rhythmic flow. 'Outdoor & Adventure' receives a score of 0.8 as the workout is conducted on the Charles River, an evident outdoor setting invoking exploration and nature. This aligns with our guideline to categorize rowing sessions recorded on rivers under this spirit. Lastly, 'Soothing & Restorative' scores 0.6, due to its low intensity (1 out of 3) and the 'Breathe' format, both of which hint at a relaxing and restorative approach. The absence of high-intensity elements or complex structures excludes 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' from consideration. Overall, the classifications are based on clear markers of rhythm, outdoor setting, and low-intensity restorative focus provided by the metadata."
