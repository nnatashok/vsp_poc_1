  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Cardio Cruise Row' offers a low-intensity rowing session, indicated by phrases like 'stay relaxed' and 'build cardio at a low intensity,' which aligns with the repetitive and sustained nature of 'The Meditative Grind.' The use of soul/funk/disco music with tracks like The Temptations' 'My Girl' and The Supremes' 'Baby Love' creates a relaxed and rhythmic atmosphere, enhancing the meditative qualities. This combination of soothing music and consistent, task-focused movement supports a score of 0.8 for 'The Meditative Grind.'\n\nAdditionally, the inclusion of vibrant and rhythmical music such as Motown hits provides an enjoyable and engaging workout experience, aligning with 'The Groove Session.' The playlist encourages a sense of fun and flow, albeit at a relaxed pace, yielding a score of 0.6. The absence of high intensity or competition rules out 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor,' reinforcing the calm yet enjoyable demeanor of this workout."
