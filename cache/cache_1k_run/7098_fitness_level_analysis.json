  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a row, which generally sets the technique difficulty between Beginner or Intermediate. The presence of \"various rhythms\" suggests some coordination is required, which accounts for the Intermediate score. However, considering it is a sweat workout meant to gauge power in intervals, many exercises will likely be straightforward rowing actions, aligning it with Beginner to Intermediate complexity. No specific complex or technical movements are described.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is approximately 16.5 minutes, which is relatively short but utilizes an interval format. This, combined with a medium intensity level (2 out of 3) and the categorization under 'sweat', suggests a workout that requires moderate to challenging physical effort. The music playlist supports sustained energy, likely leading to a higher exertion level for those less fit.",
