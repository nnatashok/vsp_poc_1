  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Since the workout is marked as suitable for all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), the technique difficulty is considered adaptable. Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'cool down,' with a 5:48 duration, indicating a low physical demand. Cool downs are intrinsically designed to gently lower heart rate and assist in recovery rather than push physical limits. The emphasis on 'technique' and the relaxing nature of the music suggests a very mild, controlled pace. The absence of high intensity cues such as high tempo or stress on cardiovascular exertion further solidifies a Light effort difficulty. Therefore, the effort difficulty aligns strongly with a Light level.",
