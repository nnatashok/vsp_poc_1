  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled \"Core Engagement + Stretch Cool-Down,\" suggests a focus on calm and restorative movement, indicative of a cool-down session. The steady format and max rhythm of 22 indicate a slow-paced activity meant to encourage relaxation and recovery, aligning with \"The Reboot Workout\" vibe. The description includes terms like \"steadily row\" and \"stretch your hamstrings,\" reinforcing the idea of a gentle, restorative session. The addition of core engagement supports a methodical approach to movement, characteristic of \"The Meditative Grind.\" Additionally, the classic rock song \"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\" by Guns N' Roses further contributes to a relaxed atmosphere, justifying the moderate match with \"The Zen Flow.\" Overall, these elements strongly align with a focus on cool-down and restorative exercises."
