Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated between Moderate and Challenging. A 21-minute duration with the descriptor 'power yoga' implies a consistent, flowing sequence of poses that raises heart rate and requires sustained effort, albeit not extremely intense. Chill and downtempo music indicate a manageable but not trivial pace. Given the target fitness levels (Beginner to Advanced), it aligns well with Moderate, challenging enough for some but not extreme.",
