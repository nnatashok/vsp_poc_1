  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of 21 minutes and is described as a 'power yoga flow,' indicating it is likely more demanding than light yoga. The continual engagement of flow-style yoga can moderately raise the heart rate, making it slightly challenging, but the short duration and potentially calming music suggest it doesn't reach a truly challenging level for effort, fitting between moderate and challenging.",
