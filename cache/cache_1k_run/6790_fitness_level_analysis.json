  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the rowing category, which generally limits technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate. The description doesn't specify complex rowing techniques, focusing instead on persistence and endurance, fitting a Beginner level. However, given the 45-minute segment marked at a 'sweat' intensity and a rhythm of 32, there could be some elements requiring coordination, thus slightly raising the Intermediate score.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of over 1 hour, the 'sweat' categorization, and the intensity level indicate a physically demanding workout. The 'sweat' workout type suggests a sustained effort, particularly during the 45-minute main session at a relatively high rhythm. While the presence of warm-up and cool-down segments moderates the overall effort level slightly, the workout still demands significant energy expenditure, hence the high Challenging score.",
