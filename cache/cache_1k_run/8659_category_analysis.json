  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified under 'Stretching' with a high confidence score of 0.9 due to several strong indicators: the workout's name is 'Hamstring Stretch', the description mentions 'simple, hamstring stretches using a band', and the listed category 'stretching'. Additionally, the video involves flexibility exercises specifically focused on the hamstrings, which further supports the classification under 'Stretching'. The use of equipment such as a resistance band does not detract from this category, as it is common in stretching routines to enhance flexibility. Although the category 'On The Mat' is mentioned, it is considered a description of the setting rather than a distinct workout type here. Other categories like 'Yoga' or 'Pilates' are excluded due to the specificity on hamstring flexibility and use of stretching rather than holistic or core-focused exercises typical in those disciplines."
