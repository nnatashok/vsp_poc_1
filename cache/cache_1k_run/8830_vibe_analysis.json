  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is a short instructional rowing session focused on handle movement, indicating a technical and skill-building approach. This aligns well with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe due to the emphasis on technique, with a score of 0.65. The calm and repetitive nature of rowing, combined with chill and downtempo music, suggests a meditative quality, fitting 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, scored at 0.7. The classification of this session as a warm-up, alongside gentle music, aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, as it serves as a low-stress, preparatory routine, receiving a score of 0.6. The absence of high intensity or competitive elements excludes more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.'"
