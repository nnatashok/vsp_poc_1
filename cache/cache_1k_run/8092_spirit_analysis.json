  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video, titled 'Upper Body Strength with Bands,' is primarily classified as 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a high confidence score of 0.9 due to the clear visual setting in a natural outdoor environment. This setting inherently emphasizes the adventurous aspect of leveraging natural landscapes for fitness. \n\nAdditionally, 'Structured & Disciplined' is assigned with a score of 0.7 because the workout focuses on posture and strength enhancement using resistance bands, which are indicative of a systematic and disciplined approach to muscle activation and conditioning. The use of specific equipment like resistance bands reinforces this spirit.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant with a score of 0.5, inspired by the music playlist filled with rhythmic tracks to accompany the exercises, suggesting a coordinated movement sequence, although this is not the main focus.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded due to the lack of indicators for extreme intensity or recovery focus in the metadata."
