  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled \"Shifting Rhythms Row\" includes rowing in both the name and is classified under the 'row' category, which strongly indicates the need for a rowing machine. Since the category type is 'row', the inclusion of a rowing machine in the required equipment is mandatory with very high confidence (1.0). The workout description mentions 'shifting in rhythm', which is a common format for rowing exercises focused on building endurance, further supporting the need for a rowing machine. The image attached also shows a person rowing, reinforcing the classification."
