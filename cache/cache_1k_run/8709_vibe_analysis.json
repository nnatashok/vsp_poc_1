  "vibesExplanation": "The assigned vibes for this workout are primarily based on the metadata which suggests a gentle, calming yoga session suitable for beginners. The workout name 'Beginner Flow' and description ('perfect if you are new to yoga, or returning to yoga') indicate a gentle, introductory experience consistent with 'The Zen Flow.' The selection of chill and downtempo music, including tracks like 'Be Kind' by Marshmello, suggests a calming and relaxed atmosphere, supporting the 'The Zen Flow' vibe with a strong match score of 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, the focus on 'flow' and the short duration may also align with 'The Reboot Workout,' as it suggests a resetting and refreshing experience, although this match is less strong due to the lack of explicit emphasis on stretching or stress relief. The description does not specifically highlight relief but may imply it through the context of beginner yoga, earning a moderate score of 0.6."
