  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout metadata indicates a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to phrases like 'explode with power and speed' and 'all out for a final 1-minute effort,' combined with the music choices from dance and global hits genres, enhancing the energetic atmosphere. The intensity level of 3 out of 3 further supports the high energy classification, reflecting a demanding and vigorous session.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is supported by the image showing rowing on a river. Although the description does not explicitly mention the environment, the nature-based setting in the image suggests the flexibility of outdoor exploration, which justifies including this spirit with a moderate score.\n\nOther spirits are less applicable here due to the absence of structured, rhythm-focused, or restorative elements, which are neither suggested in the workout description nor supported by the music and setting."
