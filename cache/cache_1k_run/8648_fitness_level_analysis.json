  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'row', which according to Hydrow's specific rule, restricts the technique difficulty to Beginner or Intermediate levels. The interval format with a maximum rhythm of 28 may require handling a moderate pace, which moves it slightly towards Intermediate due to the coordination required in adjusting rhythm. However, since rowing is fundamentally disciplined around a cyclic motion that's not highly technical, our confidence aligns more with Beginner features along with some elements of Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a 'sweat' workout type and a classification within the 'standard' level (intensity 2 out of 3), the workout likely reflects a moderate energy expenditure. The 16-minute duration, paired with an interval format, increases cardiovascular demand, nudging towards a Challenging effort. Users with lesser fitness may find this moderately challenging, but overall, the effort aligns significantly with a Moderate difficulty classification, warranting a confidence of 0.75.",
