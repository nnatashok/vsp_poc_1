  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given that the workout type is 'row' and the user fitness level requirement is 'Beginner', the Technique Difficulty aligns closely with the Beginner level, scoring 0.8. The format 'Interval' and focus on 'efficiency' might require some coordination, justifying a lower Intermediate score of 0.4. However, the metadata's receiver-friendly approach and beginner-level indication support a Beginner classification with high confidence.",

With a short duration of 11:25 and the instructor's relaxed coaching style, the effort demands align best with Light, scoring 0.8. However, the interval nature might exert slightly more energy than a purely gentle session, supporting a Moderate score of 0.4.",
