  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given the metadata, the workout type is 'row' which limits the technique difficulty to either Beginner or Intermediate. The instruction to 'focus on efficiency' and the use of rhythm 18 suggest slightly more coordination than the simplest rowing workouts, but the overall context points towards maintaining simplicity. Hence, it mostly aligns with Beginner due to its basic rhythm and lack of complex coordination requirements, but with a small possibility of Intermediate coordination due to the efficiency focus.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is relatively short at just over 11 minutes, and the intensity level is marked as 1 out of 3, indicating low physical demand. While 'interval' format can mean variable effort, the overall energy demand remains low. Thus, it classifies mainly as Light effort difficulty, with Moderate being partially considered due to the interval component.",
