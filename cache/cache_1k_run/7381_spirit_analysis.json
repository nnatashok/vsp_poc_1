  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata and image suggest a strong 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit for this workout. The title 'Reflective Rock Cool-Down' and description focusing on proper sequencing indicate a gentle and calming nature, reinforced by the 'cool down' workout type and 'technique' format, justifying a score of 0.8.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is supported by the inclusion of an 'all-rock playlist' and the workout's focus on technique, pointing to a rhythmic and coordinated approach, meriting a score of 0.7.\n\nThe image shows outdoor rowing on a river, suggesting an 'Outdoor & Adventure' element, but as the emphasis is more on cool down and reflection, its contribution is moderate, with a score of 0.5.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were not selected due to the workout's calming and reflective focus."
