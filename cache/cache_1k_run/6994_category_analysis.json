  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 0.8 based on the metadata provided. The title 'Instructional: Hip Pivot' and the description mentioning 'build power through your hip pivot' suggest a focus on rowing techniques, since hip pivot is a critical movement in rowing strokes. The category tag 'row' further supports this classification. The overall classification confidence is set to 0.75 given the specificity of terms related to rowing and the instructional nature of the workout which implies technique refinement typical in a rowing context. Although described as a warm-up, this does not distinctly fit other categories like 'Meditation', 'Yoga', or 'Stretching', which focus more on flexibility and mindfulness rather than technical skill development. The playtime of under 6 minutes also indicates a short, focused instructional segment rather than a broader workout session."
