  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row' and involves interval training. Rowing generally falls between Beginner and Intermediate in technique, given its relatively straightforward action. As there's no mention of complex rowing techniques or advanced metrics (like 'Drive' used in Hydrow videos), the complexity remains low. Furthermore, the User Fitness Level Requirement includes 'Intermediate', suggesting some coordination is needed, although the fundamental rowing technique should still be accessible for beginners with some experience.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's format involves interval rowing at varying rhythms (20, 26, and a max of 28 strokes per minute) which can significantly increase cardiovascular demand. The description indicates a sweat category workout with an intensity level of 2 out of 3, indicating moderate to challenging effort levels. The duration of over 21 minutes further supports a demanding effort, especially due to interval pacing. Combined with the varied intensity cues, this aligns with a Moderate to Challenging difficulty for users in poor shape.",
