  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Drive' which, according to Hydrow's specific rules, overrides typical classification and automatically aligns with Advanced technique difficulty. However, since it is a rowing workout, the technique difficulty is capped at Intermediate. This requires a decent level of coordination and familiarity with rowing mechanics.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's format is HIIT, which suggests short, intense bursts of activity followed by rest periods. Additionally, the intensity level is marked as 3 out of 3, indicating a high energy expenditure. The intensity, combined with a max rhythm of 30 and a duration of 11 minutes, strongly suggests a Challenging effort level. The intense nature of 'Drive' as a workout type also indicates it could verge on Extreme for deconditioned users.",
