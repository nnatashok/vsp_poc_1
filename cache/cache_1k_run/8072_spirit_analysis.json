  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Trying Something New Row' is conducted in an outdoor setting along the shores of Bergen, as indicated by the description mentioning 'navigate along the shores' and the accompanying image showing outdoor rowing. This strongly aligns it with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, earning a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe music playlist, featuring artists like Kygo and songs such as 'Take On Me', suggests a rhythmic flow, which supports a secondary association with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, leading to a score of 0.7. The use of alternating paces and intervals within the workout implies some structure, hence the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is given a score of 0.4. This score reflects the presence of methodical pacing but not as the dominant aspect. The workout intensity level is 1 out of 3, indicating a moderate focus on rhythm and exploration rather than high intensity. Therefore, other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are not applicable."
