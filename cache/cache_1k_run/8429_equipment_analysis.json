  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Racing Mindset Row,\" and the description highlights rowing down the Charles River. The category includes \"row,\" indicating a rowing workout. While the image shows outdoor rowing, for indoor workout purposes, a rowing machine would simulate this experience effectively. The metadata doesn't specify any other equipment, and the inclusion of 'HIIT' suggests high-intensity rowing. Therefore, there is very high confidence that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
