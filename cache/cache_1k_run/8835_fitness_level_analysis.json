Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout session is a cool-down, marked as low pressure and at 'walking pace', suggesting minimal exertion, which aligns well with the 'Light' level (score: 0.95).Rowing, even at low intensity, can mildly engage the cardiovascular system, aligning weakly with Moderate (score: 0.25) due to the 6-minute duration. Overall, the evidence strongly supports a Light effort classification.",
