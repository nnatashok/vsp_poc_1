  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as \"The Masterclass Workout\" with a score of 0.7 due to its focus on technique and skill-building inherent in Pilates. The term \"core specific pilates mat workout\" indicates an emphasis on precision and mastery, characteristic of a masterclass.\n\nA secondary vibe of \"The Meditative Grind,\" with a score of 0.6, is appropriate as the workout's repetitive nature and the scenic description suggest a meditative quality often found in endurance or focused workouts. Pilates itself involves repetitive exercises which align with this vibe.\n\n\"The Zen Flow\" is scored at 0.5 because of the calming effect of both the music selection and the mention of the scenic view, consistent with grounding workouts like yoga.\n\nMusic from artists like Kelly Clarkson and Jason Mraz adds a calming and positive atmosphere, which could influence the vibe towards a more relaxed and focused experience. However, the absence of explicit chill or slow-paced music lowers the confidence for both \"The Meditative Grind\" and \"The Zen Flow.\""
