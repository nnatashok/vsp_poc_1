  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is a pilates session labeled 'Core Burn Express,' indicating a focus on core exercises. The description mentions it is a 'quick, efficient pilates session,' which infers the use of a mat, as pilates is typically performed on a mat for support and comfort. The category 'On The Mat, standard, on-the-mat' further reinforces this assumption. The image depicts a person lying on a mat, supporting this conclusion. Therefore, the confidence is very high (0.9) that a mat is required for this workout."
