  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled \"Club 18 Row,\" strongly indicating that it involves rowing. The description explicitly mentions gaining power in each stroke and low rhythm intervals, which are specific to rowing. Additionally, the category includes 'row,' making the use of a rowing machine certain. Furthermore, the instructor James Dietz is noted to bring decades of rowing wisdom to every session, reinforcing that rowing is the focus of this workout. Due to these observations, there is very high confidence (1.0) that a rowing machine is required for this workout."
