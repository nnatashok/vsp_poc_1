Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the short duration of slightly over 10 minutes and the absence of listed intensity cues, the workout is likely designed to be not very demanding. The focus on a specific muscle group with no equipment further supports a lower energy expenditure characteristic of light effort. Music being Indie Alternative and Global Hits does not indicate a high tempo or high intensity. Therefore, the workout is classified primarily as Light, but a portion could reach Moderate due to targeted toning of muscles.",
