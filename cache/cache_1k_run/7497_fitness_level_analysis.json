  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 10 minutes and 44 seconds, which is relatively short and suitable for low energy expenditure. Although it involves core work to pump-up music, pilates typically focuses more on control than intensity, aligning with a 'Light' effort level. Given the running theme, it may slightly approach 'Moderate' for deconditioned users but remains primarily 'Light.'",
