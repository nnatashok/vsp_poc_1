  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence score of 0.9 due to its focus on mobility and opening up the shoulders, which are key elements of restorative exercise. The description emphasizes relaxation and stress reduction, aligning well with soothing exercises. The short duration and gentle, non-intensive music further support this classification.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is also considered with a score of 0.7. The background in the image shows an outdoor setting, which is a strong indicator. Although the workout is labeled 'On The Mat,' the outdoor environment contributes to a sense of exploration and adventure, even in its gentle format. \n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are less relevant here due to the session's emphasis on mobility over rhythmic or structured training."
