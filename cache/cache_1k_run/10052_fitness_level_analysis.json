  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Drive' and 'row', which would typically fall under Beginner or Intermediate for technique. However, Hydrow's specific rule elevates 'Drive' workouts to Advanced technique difficulty due to its presumed technical mastery required. The user fitness level requirement of 'Advanced' further supports this alignment.",
