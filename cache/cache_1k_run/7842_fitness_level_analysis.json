  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is just over 20 minutes, and described as series 'at a quick pace', indicating a more energy-demanding session. High-energy music supports the notion of an engaging, potentially challenging pace. While the time spent and quick pace indicates a high-moderate intensity, it situates towards challenging for less fit users due to sustained effort over a moderate duration with possible minimal rest.",
