  "spiritsExplanation": "The video title 'Flow + Restore' and description indicate a dual focus on movement ('flow') and recovery ('restorative poses'). This aligns with \"Flow & Rhythm\" and \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirits. The workout type 'flow' supports a smooth and rhythmic nature, scoring 0.8 for Flow & Rhythm. The relaxed music playlist, featuring artists like RY X and Glass Animals, further aligns with a soothing environment, reinforcing a 0.8 score for Soothing & Restorative.\n\nThe category 'On The Mat' and the outdoor setting seen in the image suggest an environment-driven experience, typical of 'Outdoor & Adventure' workouts. However, as the primary focus seems to be on flow and restoration rather than exploration, this spirit receives a 0.6 score.\n\nThe workout lacks the intensity or rigor for \"High-Energy & Intense,\" \"Structured & Disciplined,\" or \"Sport & Agility\" spirits, hence their exclusion."
