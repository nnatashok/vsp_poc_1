  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given that the workout falls under the 'row' category and is described as having an intensity level of 1 out of 3, the technique required is likely simple. The metadata repeatedly emphasizes a focus on learning and proper form, suggesting that the movements are likely straightforward, aiming at beginners. Since it's a steady rowing session with a consistent rhythm of 22, the rowing technique is more about maintaining form rather than complex movements. Thus, the technique difficulty aligns closely with the Beginner level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a 16-minute duration, which is relatively short, and is categorized under 'breathe,' suggesting a focus on relaxation and controlled energy expenditure. With an intensity level marked as 1 out of 3, it indicates a low effort level. The constant rhythm at 22 suggests a steady, manageable pace, making the effort difficulty align more with the Light level, suitable for those new to rowing or less physically fit.",
