  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 30 minutes long with intervals of 30\u201d and 45\u201d of bodyweight exercises, which suggests continuous movement with possible short rest periods, characteristic of moderate to challenging effort. The exercise interval timings can lead to intermediate cardiovascular demand and muscular endurance requirements, especially for users with lower fitness. This aligns more with a moderate effort level, with a possibility of being challenging for deconditioned users.",
