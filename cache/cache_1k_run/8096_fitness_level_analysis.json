  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type is 'drive' and includes 'row' under the category, with a specified high rhythm of up to 32. Since rowing workouts on this platform can only be classified at most as 'Intermediate' for technique difficulty, the 'drive' workout typically involves maintaining a strong, steady form throughout high-energy rowing. This would still generally fit within an Intermediate level as complex coordination or advanced skills are not heavily emphasized beyond maintaining form at higher intensity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is meant to maintain a high rhythm for maximum meters over a period of 11 minutes and 22 seconds. With the workout intensity level specified as 3 out of 3, it involves sustained high-intensity rowing ('race off a high rhythm'), indicating significant physical demand. However, the relatively short duration prevents it from reaching 'Extreme' as effort difficulty. Therefore, it aligns best with 'Challenging'.",
