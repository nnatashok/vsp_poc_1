Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of just over 10 minutes and described as 'fast-paced', the workout likely involves continuous movement, elevating heart rate and requiring sustained effort. While this falls into 'Moderate' effort due to the short duration, the focus on core strength with a fast pace could challenge less fit users, slightly aligning it with 'Challenging' effort. Given the description, 'Challenging' is less emphasized but relevant considering intensity cues.",
