  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'All in One Row' is classified with the primary vibe of 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.75 due to its endurance-focused structure involving a 20-minute interval at 'Drive intensity'. The presence of sustained rowing suggests the repetitive, focused nature characteristic of long, meditative workouts. The secondary vibe, 'The Endorphin Wave', scored at 0.65, is supported by the high-intensity level (3 out of 3) and the progressive nature of the interval training, likely leading to an 'elevated energy' and 'feel-good movement' experience. The inclusion of '90s British bands and radio stations (Indie Alternative, Global Hits)' points to a strong musical component that enhances motivation and rhythm, justifying including 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' with a score of 0.5 due to its beat-driven element. While the workout has competitive aspects, the absence of direct gamification elements and leaderboards exclude 'The Competitor' vibe. The absence of strong expressiveness or explosive movements also rules out 'The Nightclub Workout' and 'The Warrior Workout'."
