  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The metadata indicates a 'Drive' workout type focused on rowing, with high rhythm requirements (28 to 34 strokes per minute). While rowing itself is considered beginner to intermediate in technique complexity, the inclusion of a 'Drive' classification traditionally suggests a higher skill level, pushing it to a strong Intermediate classification. Additionally, high rhythm HIIT intervals may require moderate coordination and control, aligning well with Intermediate technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout intensity level is rated as 3 out of 3, indicating a highly demanding session. The use of high rhythm intervals (28 to 34) in a HIIT format suggests significant energy expenditure and short rest periods over almost 12 minutes, aligning more with Challenging effort difficulty. However, the term 'Drive' often implies a notably intense session, warranting partial consideration towards an Extreme classification.",
