  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 10-minute 'Core Burn Express', indicating a quick but intensive session focused on the core. The intensity implied by the word 'Burn' and the focus on advanced pilates techniques suggest a demand for moderate to challenging effort, particularly for the core-focused nature. Given the short duration, energy expenditure would likely reside around Moderate, with potentially Challenging effort if the exercises are high-paced or involve quick transitions, indicated by the energetic playlist.",
