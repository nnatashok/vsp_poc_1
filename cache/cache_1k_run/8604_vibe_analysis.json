  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video \"Cardio + Whole Body Circuit\" features intense activities combining cardio and strength using dumbbells in an AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) format, suggesting a high-energy session fitting \"The Warrior Workout\" vibe. The use of high-tempo Hip Hop/R&B and Global Hits music further supports this by emphasizing a powerful, energetic atmosphere (score: 0.75). The AMRAP format introduces a gamified element, aligning with \"The Competitor\" vibe due to its challenge to perform maximum rounds (score: 0.7). The fast-paced, short-duration workout with 1- and 2-minute interval splits on the Hydrow suggests unpredictable intensity, aligning moderately with \"The Adrenaline Rush\" (score: 0.6). The strong emphasis on performance and endurance supports confidence in these vibes."
