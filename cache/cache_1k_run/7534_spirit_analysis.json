  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Divide + Climb Row' is primarily identified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to its description focusing on breaking the workout into climbing efforts, culminating in a 'final 1-minute blaster,' indicative of high intensity. The term 'sweat' and the category of 'sweat,standard,row' further support this classification. The max rhythm of 28 and intensity level of 2 out of 3 are additional indicators of its vigorous nature. The music genre, featuring energetic remixes, complements the intensity.\n\nSecondly, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is relevant given that the session is a rowing workout recorded on a river. This setting inherently suggests outdoor activity and engagement with the natural environment. The image of rowing on a river reinforces this aspect, warranting a strong score in this spirit.\n\nThe use of structure (e.g., climbing format) doesn\u2019t dominate enough to classify under 'Structured & Disciplined,' and other spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were not relevant given the workout's focus on intensity and external environment."
