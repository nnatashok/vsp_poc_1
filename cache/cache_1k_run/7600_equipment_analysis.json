  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description explicitly mentions a 'mini band' as a recommended piece of equipment, which is categorized under 'Resistance bands.' This suggests a very high confidence (0.9) that resistance bands are necessary for the workout, as they are integral to the exercises targeting hips, glutes, and core. The mention of the category 'On The Mat' strongly implies the use of a mat, supporting floor-based exercises, which leads to a high confidence (0.8) that a mat is needed to perform the workout effectively. The combination of these elements allows for targeted muscle engagement and comfort during the exercises."
