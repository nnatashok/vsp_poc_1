  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Drive' in the metadata, which, according to Hydrow-specific rules, typically requires an Advanced level of technique difficulty. Although 'row' workouts generally cap at Intermediate difficulty, 'Drive' nuances involve a higher degree of technique due to intervals and heightened intensity, as denoted by the max rhythm of 32 and the specified intensity level of 3 out of 3.",
