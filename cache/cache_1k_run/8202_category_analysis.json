  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Unleashed Row' primarily suggests an Indoor Rowing session due to the repeated use of terms like 'row', 'intervals', and 'drive' in the metadata. The description highlights 'four 5-minute intervals' which are characteristic of a rowing machine workout. Additionally, the provided workout type tags include 'row', reinforcing the Indoor Rowing classification. The 'Intervals' and 'max rhythm: 30' also indicate a structured, high-intensity workout pattern similar to High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), justifying its secondary inclusion. The playlist features high-energy music typically used to motivate during intense workouts. Although the intensity level is marked as 3 out of 3, indicating high exertion, further evidence of an organized rowing structure validated this decision, setting a category confidence level at 0.85."
