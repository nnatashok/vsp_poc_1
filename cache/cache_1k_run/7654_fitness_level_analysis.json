  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 21-minute duration combined with 'Chill mid' and 'Cool/Downtempo' music genres suggest a low-intensity session focused on controlled breathing and movement, typical of light to moderate energy expenditure sessions. Additionally, core-focused yoga flow usually requires attention to breath control and posture rather than exerting a high cardio or muscular demand, aligning it with Light, potentially reaching Moderate if a user engages deeply with core tension.",
