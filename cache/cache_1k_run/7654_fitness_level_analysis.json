  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 21 minutes, which is substantial but not overly long, suggesting a moderate level of physical exertion. Core-centered yoga, combined with the use of ambient music (Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo), implies a workout intensity that is controlled yet sustaining, aligning well with a Moderate level of effort difficulty. It's likely accessible to those with some physical challenge capacity but does not push into higher exertion like a HIIT session would.",
