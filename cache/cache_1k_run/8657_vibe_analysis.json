  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Firestarter' with a score of 0.9 due to the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format and short duration of 11 minutes 24 seconds, suggesting a fast, explosive session. The music selection, featuring upbeat and energetic tracks like 'Tainted Love' and 'Boys In Town,' aligns with an electrifying vibe. The high intensity level (3 out of 3) supports this classification.\n\n'Warrior Workout' is also relevant with a score of 0.8 due to the focus on primal energy and sweat-dripping exertion typical of high-intensity rowing sessions. The lack of an instructor emphasizes a personal drive and challenge immersion.\n\nThe inclusion of pop and global hits points to a lively atmosphere, often associated with The Firestarter vibe. Other vibes were excluded as the intensity and music selection do not align with more meditative or rhythmic qualities."
