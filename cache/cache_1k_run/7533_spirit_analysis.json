  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is set outdoors along the Charles River, explicitly indicating an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit with a high score of 0.85. Rowing in a natural environment emphasizes exploration and leveraging terrain, key to this spirit. The use of rhythmic music genres like Soul/Funk/Disco and the presence of power intervals suggest elements of the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a score of 0.6. The interval format and the focus on warming up the whole body in a systematic way imply a 'Structured & Disciplined' approach, meriting a score of 0.5. The warm-up nature and musical influences support the rhythmic and structured elements, even as the outdoor setting strongly defines the overall workout spirit."
