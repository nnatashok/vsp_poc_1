  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily a 'Reverse Climb Cool-Down,' indicative of a gentle, calming session meant to lower intensity while cooling down. This aligns well with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which is centered on deep stretching, low-stress, and refreshing the body. The metadata supports this with a focus on lowering rhythm and a short duration, typical of cooldowns, earning it a score of 0.75.\n\nThe music selection, featuring soul, funk, and disco tracks such as 'Axel F' and 'Neutron Dance,' adds an enjoyable, rhythmic aspect that gives it elements of 'The Groove Session.' The upbeat musical background can provide a fun and fluid transition from intense to relaxed states, although it's less central to the workout's primary purpose. Therefore, this vibe is assigned a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nThe absence of intense physical challenge or competitive elements, along with the specific musical choices, exclude more intense or competitive vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.' The confidence in this classification is high due to clear indicators in the metadata."
