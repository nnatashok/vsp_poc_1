  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'Indoor Rowing' with a high score (0.9) because the title explicitly states 'Cardio Surge Row,' indicating a rowing workout. Furthermore, the description mentions 'endurance intervals' and 'low rhythms,' which are typical of rowing, particularly on an ergometer.\n\n'Breathing exercises' is also chosen, albeit with a lower score (0.6), because the workout type mentions 'breathe,' suggesting a focus on controlled breathing. However, it doesn't seem to be the primary focus; thus, its lower score reflects some ambiguity.\n\nThe music and playlist are energizing and likely intended to maintain motivation during the rowing session but do not directly suggest a distinct workout category, strengthening the primary 'Rowing' focus."
