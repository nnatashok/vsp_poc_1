  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Core Flow,' and the category is 'On The Mat,' strongly implying the use of a mat. The description refers to this as a 'core flow' exercise, which typically involves movements performed on the ground that require a mat for comfort and support. The image also shows a mat explicitly under the participant, further confirming its necessity. Thus, the confidence score for the mat is very high at 0.9."
