Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's total duration is under 6 minutes, comprising mostly low-intensity rowing with brief pauses, indicative of a Light effort level. The Cool Down classification and leisurely pace (max rhythm of 22) reinforce the low energy demand. However, the combination of continuous rowing even at a gentle intensity could be somewhat moderate for severely deconditioned users, which supports a Moderate score to a lesser extent.",
