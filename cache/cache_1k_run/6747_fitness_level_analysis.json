  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This workout includes 4 minutes of rowing at a low rhythm of 22 strokes per minute, combined with 1 minute of pausing and stretching. The brief duration and low intensity make it minimally demanding, suitable for a low-energy cool-down. Therefore, the effort difficulty scores highly for Light at 0.9, reflecting the limited physical demand, while Moderate is included at 0.1 due to the continuous movement nature of rowing.",
