  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as Yoga based on several factors. The title 'Hip-Opening Flow' and description 'moving with Owen to open your hips' strongly suggest yoga practices like flow sequences designed to increase flexibility and openness in the hip area, common in yoga routines. The word 'flow' is frequently used in yoga to describe a series of poses. The playlist includes chill and downtempo music, which aligns well with yoga sessions that are often calming and meditative. 'On The Mat' and 'flow' also support a yoga classification with a score of 0.8 due to its centrality.\n\nThe secondary classification is Stretching with a score of 0.7. The focus on 'opening your hips' directly relates to stretching exercises, particularly those in yoga aiming to increase flexibility in those areas. The workout's setting on a mat without specified equipment further implies a stretching component within a yoga flow context. Other categories were excluded as there is no indication of high intensity or body weight exercises."
