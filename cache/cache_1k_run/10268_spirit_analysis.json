  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Refine Your Stroke Cool-Down' primarily embodies a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.8. This is evident from the focus on 'stroke refinement' and 'pick drills,' which indicate a methodical approach emphasizing technique and precision. The mention of specific drills like 'legs-only,' 'legs and arms,' and 'full strokes' further underscores the structured nature of the session, aiming to improve rowing technique systematically.\n\nA 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also present with a score of 0.7, as the workout is a 'cool-down' session characterized by a 'max rhythm: 20' and 'Chill mid, Cool/Downtempo' music. These aspects suggest a focus on relaxation and recovery, typical of a restorative workout.\n\nFinally, the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit scores 0.6, as supported by the outdoor setting depicted in the image, which shows a participant rowing on a river. This environmental element contributes to an adventurous and natural aspect of the rowing experience. Overall, the metadata provides a clear indication of these spirits, with a high confidence level of 0.8."
