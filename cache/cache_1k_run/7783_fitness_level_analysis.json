  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Welcome to Norway Flow' is a 21-minute workout with a focus on serenity indicated by 'chill' and 'downtempo' music. These elements suggest a low-intensity session, suitable for a relaxed pace. Such characteristics are indicative of 'Light' effort due to a brief duration and likely gentle movement (0.7 score), but some 'Moderate' effort aspects may appear due to core engagement and continuous movement, hence a minor score of (0.3 score) for 'Moderate.' The presence of the word 'flow' indicates consistent movement, but not necessarily high exertion.",
