Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a short duration of under 6 minutes and a categorization as a 'warm-up', the effort difficulty is primarily Light. The phrase 'prepare for any workout' suggests it is not intended to be physically taxing on its own, further supporting a light effort difficulty. The session's potential energy is slightly increased by the motivational instruction and music, allowing for light to moderate activity alignment, but overall, it's more aligned with light effort.",
