Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout's short duration of approximately 6 minutes and its designation as a warm-up, the effort required is minimal. Warm-ups generally involve lighter movements to gradually increase heart rate without significant exertion. Although intervals can suggest varied intensity, the context of a warm-up with rowing for under 6 minutes keeps the energy expenditure low. Consequently, this aligns strongly with Light effort difficulty, with only slight connections to Moderate due to interval format.",
