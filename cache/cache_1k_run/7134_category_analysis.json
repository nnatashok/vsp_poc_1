  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Stretching' with a score of 1.0, based on explicit metadata indicators. The workout name 'Essential Stretches for Your Back' and the described activities 'Release tension and stiffness, and gain flexibility with Peter and James' clearly indicate a focus on stretching exercises aimed at improving flexibility and reducing back tension. The classification of 'Workout Type: stretching' confirms this, providing strong evidence for the Stretching category.\n\nAdditionally, the category 'Mat' is assigned a score of 0.6. The metadata's 'Category: On The Mat' suggests that the exercises are performed on an exercise mat, which is a common setup for stretching exercises. This further supports the inclusion of 'Mat' as an appropriate secondary category, although it is secondary to the main focus on stretching. The simple stretching emphasis prevents the inclusion of related categories like Yoga or Pilates, as there are no indicators of mindfulness or specific methodology associated with those practices.\n\nGiven the provided metadata, the classification and scores are made with very high confidence (1.0), with no ambiguity about the central role of stretching in this workout."
