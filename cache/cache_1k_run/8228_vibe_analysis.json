  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Reboot Workout' with a score of 0.8 because it is explicitly labeled as a 'cool down,' which aims for a deep stretch, low stress, and total-body refresh. The 'steady' format, along with the location description of 'Glacier View,' suggests a soothing experience conducive to recovery, rather than intense exertion.\n\n'Nature Flow' is chosen as a secondary vibe due to the ambiance created by the description mentioning a journey towards 'Fox Glacier.' This evokes imagery of an outdoor, scenic experience, aligning with the concept of breath-centered and full-body rhythm in nature workouts. The music being low beat (genres like 'Pop low' and 'Global Hits') fits the rhythm but not so strongly as to command a full Nature Flow vibe.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Meditative Grind' were considered but excluded because the settings and description focus on cooldowns rather than introspective or meditative routines."
