  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'row' category, which typically dictates Beginner or Intermediate technique levels. The description advises maintaining a 'steady rhythm,' suggesting fundamental rowing techniques. The max rhythm of 24 and a workout type focusing on 'breathe' imply simplicity in execution with minimal coordination demands, strongly aligning it with Beginner technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 16 minutes long with a 'steady state' focus, indicative of sustained low-intensity activity. With an intensity level of 1 out of 3 and steady, controlled pacing, it suggests low energy expenditure, aligning with a Light effort difficulty. The duration and intensity make a Moderate level plausible but less dominant.",
