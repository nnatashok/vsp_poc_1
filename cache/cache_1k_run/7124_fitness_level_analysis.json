  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'row', making the Technique Difficulty either Beginner or Intermediate according to the guidelines. Given the steady state nature of the workout and the focus on maintaining a steady rhythm, the movements involved are likely simple and repeatable, suggesting a strong alignment with Beginner. There's a minor possibility of some complexity due to rhythm maintenance, which slightly hints at Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short at 16 minutes, combined with a 'breathe' workout type and a medium intensity level ('1 out of 3'). This suggests a Moderate effort difficulty, suitable for endurance building but not overly strenuous. The steady rhythm at a low max rhythm rate (24) points towards a sustained moderate effort, making it more accessible than a challenging or extreme effort classification.",
