  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is brief, lasting only 5 minutes and 47 seconds, and is described as a 'post-row mobility session,' which suggests a focus on gentle stretching and muscle release, targeting specific areas like the lower back and shoulders. This aligns with a 'Light' effort difficulty, as there is minimal energy expenditure typical of mobility and recovery sessions and no intense physical demands.",
