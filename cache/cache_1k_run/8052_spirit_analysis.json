  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled 'World Mental Health Day Cool-Down' is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with high confidence due to several indicators. The description emphasizes reflection and education on mental health, fitting the theme of a cool-down focused on relaxation and recovery. The use of downtempo and classical music, as well as the low pace (max rhythm of 20), further supports this classification, highlighting a calming atmosphere. The workout type is explicitly marked as a 'cool down,' reinforcing the focus on soothing and restorative activity.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also relevant due to the rowing activity taking place outdoors on a river, as evidenced by the image provided. This environment encourages a connection to nature, promoting exploration and tranquility. However, the primary emphasis remains on the soothing aspect, thus receiving a slightly lower score of 0.75.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Flow & Rhythm,' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the emphasis on a slow and reflective cool-down session rather than intensity or structured movement."
