  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which suggests low to moderate technique difficulty. As the workout type is 'drive', which per Hydrow's specific classification indicates an Advanced technique level. However, due to the ruling that rowers primarily fall within Beginner or Intermediate levels, this workout aligns strongly with these two levels. The HIIT format suggests a need for some coordination, hence the Intermediate rating is highly pertinent.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of over 21 minutes combined with a maximum rhythm of 30 in a HIIT format and a 3 out of 3 intensity level suggests a high energy expenditure and physical demand. These factors indicate a Challenging to Extreme level of effort required, supported by the driving music genre which typically energizes and ups the intensity of effort involved.",
