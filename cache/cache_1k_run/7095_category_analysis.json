  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is clearly an 'Indoor rowing' session as indicated by the title 'Endurance Climb Row' and the mention of 'row' in the category section. The description mentions 4-minute intervals with a climbing rhythm, which is typical of rowing workouts focused on endurance. Furthermore, the use of terms like 'Build your endurance with Aisyah' and 'climb' suggests an indoor rowing workout structure. The explicit mention of rhythm and intervals aligns with common practices in rowing sessions. The intensity level is marked as 2 out of 3, indicating a medium to high intensity, suitable for an endurance workout, which further supports the classification under 'Indoor rowing'. Other potential categories such as 'HIIT' or 'Mat' were not fitting due to lack of supporting details such as high intensity interval descriptions or bodyweight exercise mentions. Therefore, the confidence in classifying this video as 'Indoor rowing' is very high."
