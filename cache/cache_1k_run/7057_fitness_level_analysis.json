  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'row', which traditionally falls within Beginner to Intermediate levels regarding technique difficulty. Rowing inherently involves repetitive motions with a focus on coordination and rhythm, making it accessible for those at a beginner level. However, given the specified rhythm of 26 and interval format, there might be a need for some coordination skill, elevating the potential for intermediate-level difficulty. Consequently, both Beginner and Intermediate are relevant here, but with a slightly higher emphasis on Beginner due to the general accessibility of rowing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 21 minutes and 33 seconds which along with the 'sweat' type and the interval format suggests a moderate level of effort required, as intervals usually involve fluctuations in effort. The intensity level of 2 out of 3 indicates a moderately demanding pace. Therefore, this workout can be seen as moderately challenging but could be perceived as more challenging for those less fit, hence the inclusion of the 'Challenging' level as well.",
