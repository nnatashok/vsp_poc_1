  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a workout type of 'cool down' and a duration of only 5 minutes and 40 seconds, the Effort Difficulty is classified as Light. The session's purpose is to serve as a cool down, which inherently suggests low energy expenditure. The rhythm is low, which further reduces intensity. It is aligned with Light difficulty (score 0.85), with a small potential for Moderate difficulty (score 0.15) due to rowing engagement.",
