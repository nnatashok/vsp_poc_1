  "categoriesExplanation": "The metadata explicitly indicates that this workout is a stretching session appropriate for post-rowing activity. The workout name 'Post-Row Stretch' and description clearly emphasize stretching for muscle groups impacted by rowing, specifically stating it targets hip flexors, back, and side body. The category 'On The Mat' further supports that the exercises are performed on the floor, aligning with stretching routines. The music genre and playlist do not heavily influence the category classification. Given its short duration and clear focus on specific muscle relaxation, it aligns directly with the Stretching category. No evidence supports any other categories."
