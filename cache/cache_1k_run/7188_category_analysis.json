  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video \"Fix Your Posture\" focuses on exercises for improving posture, targeting the neck, shoulders, and upper back, which aligns closely with the Stretching category as these types of exercises typically involve flexibility and mobility work. The description directly mentions 'mobility', supporting the choice of Stretching as the primary category, scoring 0.7 due to its central focus. Furthermore, the association with 'On The Mat' suggests some yoga-like qualities that involve floor exercises and deliberate, possibly meditative postures, justifying a score of 0.5 for Yoga due to the similarity in posture-focused exercises, though not explicitly stated as yoga. The exercises' focus on body control and alignment slightly aligns with Pilates, particularly in relation to posture correction, warranting a 0.4 score. Other categories such as Body weight or Meditation were excluded due to the lack of emphasis on strength training or mindfulness practices, and no explicit mention of equipment or weighted exercises."
