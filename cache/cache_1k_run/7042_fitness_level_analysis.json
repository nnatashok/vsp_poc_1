Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a short duration of just under 6 minutes and is classified as a warm-up, indicating a primary emphasis on preparation and light intensity. The format as 'Interval' suggests brief moments of increased exertion, but within a warm-up context, it remains largely low in intensity. Therefore, Light effort is the most fitting classification, with a minor Moderate component.",
