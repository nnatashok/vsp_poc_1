Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration under 6 minutes and being a warm-up, the physical demand is low. Although it's aligned with an interval format, which could increase intensity slightly, the short duration and nature as a preparatory activity keep it predominantly light. The mention of 'ignite your leg drive' suggests some effort, justifying a moderate effort difficulty score as a secondary, lower-scored classification.",
