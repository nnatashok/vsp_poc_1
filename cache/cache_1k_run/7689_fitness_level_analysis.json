  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a 30-minute duration and the emphasis on flowing and restorative poses, the workout is designed for recovery and relaxation, indicating light physical demand. The calming music genre supports this interpretation and suggests a low-intensity session. The inclusion of 'flow' may involve some mild effort, slightly nudging towards Moderate, but overall remains easy on physical demand.",
