Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session duration is approximately 31 minutes, and it involves a 'flow' and 'restore' type workout. Given the cool/downtempo music and the restorative element, the workout likely falls at the lighter end of the effort spectrum but with a potential for moderate level in sustained movement phases. The lack of intensity cues and the focus on restorative poses suggest low energy expenditure fits well with the 'Light' level.",
