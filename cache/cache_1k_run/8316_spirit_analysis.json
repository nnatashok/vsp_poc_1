  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Steady Cool-Down' is primarily characterized by a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to the cool-down focus and the reflective pace at a steady rhythm. The term 'cool down' and the moderate pacing with a max rhythm of 20 suggest the session is geared towards relaxation and recovery, directly aligning with the restorative spirit. This is reinforced by the Pop Low music selection, which often complements a calming environment.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant, indicated by the description mentioning a steady rhythm and the playlist featuring smooth and harmonious songs like 'Someone To Be Around' by Six60 and 'Precious Love' by James Morrison. The rowing action likely follows these musical cues, leading to a coordinated, rhythmic experience.\n\nAdditionally, the image indicates an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit since the session is conducted on a river, leveraging the natural outdoor setting, which enhances the adventurous element despite the session\u2019s primary restorative aim. The confidence level is high due to clear indicators in the metadata and the supplementary image."
