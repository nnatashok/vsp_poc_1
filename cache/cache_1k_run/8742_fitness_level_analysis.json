  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified within the 'row' category and the technique involves steady rowing at low rhythms with a maximum of 24 strokes per minute, indicating minimal complexity. The presence of multiple instructors could suggest a very minor increase in required coordination, slightly raising the potential for an Intermediate classification, but primarily it aligns with Beginner, as the movements involved (rowing) are fundamental and straightforward.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'light effort', reinforced by the low intensity level of 1 out of 3 and the duration of just under 12 minutes. These details, alongside the 'breathe' format and the 'Steady' row category, point to low energy expenditure and an emphasis on maintaining a gentle pace, typical of Light effort workouts. However, rowing inherently requires more effort than very gentle activities, warranting a slight consideration for a Moderate alignment.",
