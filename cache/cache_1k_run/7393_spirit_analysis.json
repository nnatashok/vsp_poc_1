  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily identified with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a high score of 0.8. This is due to the mention of 'pick drill' and 'technique', which indicates a methodical focus on improving rowing skills, typical of structured training sessions. The inclusion of 'power interval' further emphasizes a systematic approach to enhancing performance.\n\nThe 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also strongly represented with a score of 0.7. The image of rowing on a river and the absence of indoor equipment suggests the workout takes place in a natural outdoor setting.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' receives a moderate score of 0.5. The presence of rhythmic pop music, such as 'Spice Up Your Life' and 'Just Dance', supports elements of a paced and coordinated workout, contributing to a music-driven flow.\n\n'Soothing & Restorative', 'High-Energy & Intense', and 'Sport & Agility' were not selected due to the lack of indicators typical for these spirits, such as recovery focus, extreme exertion, or specialized sports drills."
