  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'row' type, which generally suggests basic rowing movements. Given the 'standard' category and lack of additional equipment or complex techniques mentioned, the movements are likely simple and straightforward. The user fitness level requirements state 'Beginner', reinforcing this as a workout suitable for those with minimal rowing skills. Any coordination needed to maintain 'steady speed' at a 'max rhythm: 20' is manageable for beginners, hence a Beginner level is most appropriate with high confidence, although executing consistent rows could suggest a minor intermediate component.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is brief at just over 11 minutes and is classified with a low intensity (1 out of 3). 'Steady' format indicates a lower, consistent exertion level without spikes in intensity. The emphasis on 'breathe' suggests a focus on controlled, moderate energy expenditure, suitable for less fit users. Although rhythmic coordination is needed, the light classification is strongly supported given the gentle pace implied by the 'max rhythm: 20' and absence of additional strenuous tasks, with some moderate consideration due to sustained effort required.",
