  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'breathe' rowing session, which typically focuses on maintaining a steady pace and emphasizes rhythmic stroke management. Given this, the technique required aligns closely with Beginner levels because rowing inherently involves basic movement patterns with minimal complexity, particularly in a non-intense, rhythmic rowing session. Although some elements might slightly suggest an Intermediate level due to maintaining form over the duration, the metadata clearly positions this as accessible to beginners, further supported by the requirement for a 'beginner' user fitness level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 'steady speed' rowing session lasting 11 minutes with a maximum rhythm of 20. This correlates with Light to Moderate effort levels. The workout's intensity level is labeled as 1 out of 3, suggesting it is relatively gentle, especially considering its short duration and low rhythmic cadence, typically requiring low-to-moderate physical exertion.",
