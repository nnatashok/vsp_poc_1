  "vibesExplanation": "The workout vibe is predominantly 'The Zen Flow' with a score of 0.8. This decision is strongly supported by the inclusion of serene Norwegian surroundings, the focus on flow, and chill/downtempo music, which suggest a grounding and breath-centered experience. The use of terms like 'serene surroundings' and 'flow' highlights the causal and intentional nature of this workout, typical of a Zen practice.\n\n'Nature Flow' follows with a score of 0.6, driven by the scenic Norwegian setting which aligns with outdoor and rhythm-infused elements, enhancing the breath-centered focus.\n\nFinally, 'The Meditative Grind' scores 0.5 as the core-focused flow suggests a repetitive and focused mindset typical of meditative endurance workouts. The absence of high intensity markers and high-energy music further supports these vibes. The use of chilled music and overall setting contribute to a meditative and immersive experience."
