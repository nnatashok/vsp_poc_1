  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified under both 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits. The title 'Power Row' and description mentioning 'building energy and power during intervals' strongly indicate a high-energy and intense spirit. The workout has a maximum rhythm of 36+ and is marked at the highest intensity level of 3 out of 3, reinforcing this classification. The playlist of energetic songs by Dropkick Murphys and other indie bands further supports this energetic theme, leading to a strong match (score: 0.9) for 'High-Energy & Intense.'\n\nAdditionally, the mention of returning to the 'Charles River' and the visual showing rowing on a river set this workout firmly in the 'Outdoor & Adventure' category. The natural setting and water-based activity strongly relate to this spirit, leading to a strong match (score: 0.9) for 'Outdoor & Adventure.' The interval format and 'drive' category further highlight the structured approach, but the outdoor aspect and intensity are more dominant, so other spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' were not selected."
