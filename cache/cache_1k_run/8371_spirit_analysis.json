  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Steady Cool-Down' centers on gradually reducing heart rate, as indicated by the description 'cool down' and 'steady' rowing. This clearly aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, earning a high score of 0.9 due to its focus on recovery and relaxation. \n\nThe phrase 'row steadily' and the integration of Latin and Global Hits suggest a rhythmic element, supporting a secondary classification of 'Flow & Rhythm' with a moderate score of 0.6. The rhythmic rowing and musical background promote a smooth, continuous movement pattern, reinforcing this spirit.\n\nThe image depicting rowing in a natural outdoor setting, along with the presence of river visuals, justifies the inclusion of the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit with a score of 0.5. Although not central to the workout, the natural environment adds an adventurous undertone.\n\nOther spirits were excluded as there is no emphasis on intensity ('High-Energy & Intense'), methodical training protocols ('Structured & Disciplined'), or sports-specific skills ('Sport & Agility')."
