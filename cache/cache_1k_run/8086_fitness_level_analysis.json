  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically indicates Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty. The use of 'breathe, standard, row' suggests a focus on steady rhythm and basic rowing form, suitable for beginners. The 'maintain consistent split' instruction implies some attention to form but not beyond basic capabilities. Thus, strong alignment with Beginner (0.9) with moderate signals for Intermediate (0.3).",
