  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is aptly described by 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its focus on endurance rowing and interval training, which involve repetition and sustained effort. The use of 'sweat' in both the description and category suggests a focus on consistency and endurance. The music selection, featuring pop and global hits, aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave,' providing a feel-good, steady motivational background. The rowing aspect strengthens the meditative and rhythmic nature of the experience, particularly given the variability in stroke rates (22, 26, and 28 strokes per minute), which indicates a methodical, pace-driven workout. The moderate intensity level aligns with both vibes, as it implies sustained exertion without extreme bursts of energy. Because of these factors, 'The Meditative Grind' and 'The Endorphin Wave' are both fitting, though neither is exclusively dominant, reflected by their moderate scores."
