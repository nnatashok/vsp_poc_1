  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Steady State Row' and described as a cardio base-building exercise, which aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe due to its focus on steady repetition and foundational endurance. The use of 'steady state' and 'breathe' further supports this classification. The rhythmic row pace at 22 and 24 strokes per minute also emphasizes the consistent repetition characteristic of this vibe, leading to a score of 0.8.\n\nHowever, the playlist with pop hits like 'DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love' and 'Shape Of You' suggests an element of fun and engagement, pointing towards 'The Groove Session'. The presence of upbeat, popular music adds a layer of expressive movement and slight euphoria, despite the steady workout format. This combination justifies a 0.6 score for 'The Groove Session'.\n\nThe overall intensity level and explicit focus on rhythm and music are indicative of a moderate confidence level in these vibe classifications."
