  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Drive' workout type and category suggests an advanced understanding of rowing mechanics, but based on the general rules, rowing exercises are typically classified as Beginner or Intermediate. The focus on 'high intensity intervals' and maintaining 'proper form' hints at some technical complexity, elevating it to a strong Intermediate classification. The classification aligns with the 'Drive' specification, though does not exceed the Hydrow-specific adaptations for rowing techniques.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 31:26 minutes combined with a 'high intensity interval' format and maximum rhythm of 32 indicates a significant physical demand. The intensity level marked as 3 out of 3 further confirms the high energy expenditure, positioning this workout at the cusp between Challenging and Extreme. Given the structured intervals and described high speeds, both effort classifications are appropriate, catering towards different user baselines.",
