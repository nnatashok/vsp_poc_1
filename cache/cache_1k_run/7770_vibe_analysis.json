  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, \"Welcome to Norway Row,\" suggests a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format with 1-minute intervals, indicative of adrenaline-pumping activity, warranting a vibe of \"The Adrenaline Rush\" with a 0.8 score. The inclusion of popular upbeat songs like 'Higher Love' and 'Stole The Show,' and the descriptors from the description align this workout with \"The Nightclub Workout\" vibe, suggesting a beat-driven intensity and energy, thus earning a 0.7 score. The scenic component implied by \"Destination, Norway,\" executed in Nord\u00e5svannet Bay points toward an \"The Explorer's Workout\" vibe, which involves adventure and nature, but given the primary indoor focus, this vibe is rated with a 0.6 score. The confidence level is high due to explicit indications like the HIIT format and intense music playlist."
