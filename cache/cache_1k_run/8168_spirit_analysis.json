  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Structured & Disciplined' (0.8) due to the emphasis on 'technique-focused' elements in the description, indicating a careful, methodical approach to warming up and isolating the legs. This aligns with a structured and disciplined spirit.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' (0.6) is also relevant, as the workout includes a 'max rhythm: 26' and utilizes music from Indie Alternative and Global Hits, suggesting an element of musicality and coordination in the session.\n\nThe image of rowing on a river suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' aspect (0.5), though the workout itself is categorized as a warm-up in a likely indoor session. The spirit is noted with moderate confidence due to the visual context.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were less applicable due to the warm-up nature and absence of high-intensity or recovery-focused language."
