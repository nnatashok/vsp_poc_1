  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title and description indicate it is part of a 'December Race' and mentions maximum pace rhythms specific to rowing (28 thru 32). The category includes 'row', which strongly points towards rowing activities. Additionally, the image depicts a person rowing. Therefore, a rowing machine is required with very high confidence (1.0) as it is central to this type of workout."
