  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Whole Body Circuit' features a dumbbell circuit with intervals on the Hydrow, indicating repetitive and disciplined activity, suitable for 'The Disciplined Grind' vibe, with a score of 0.7. This classification is supported by the EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute) format, suggesting a structured, no-excuse workout. \n\nAdditionally, the focus on complete body engagement and 90-second intervals align with 'The Meditative Grind,' signifying steady endurance rowing combined with circuit training, hence a score of 0.6 is appropriate here.\n\nThe unspecified but energetic music genres of 80's and Global Hits, along with rhythmic exercises, slightly suggest a 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, attributing to its beat-driven nature, earning it a score of 0.5. The mix of rowing and strength training also adds fluid dynamics suitable for this vibe. These vibes are selected based on the workout's format and equipment used."
