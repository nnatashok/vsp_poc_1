  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.8, due to its emphasis on gradually building rhythm, as mentioned in the description ('Gradually build in rhythm'). The workout is set to music that encourages a flowing and rhythmic pace, with playlists featuring artists like Bahamas and Hozier, supporting seamless movement and mind-body connection.\n\nThe image of the workout being conducted on a river contributes significantly to the 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification with a score of 0.7. This setting suggests a nature-based experience, even though the workout intensity is relatively low (1 out of 3), aligning well with an adventurous spirit.\n\nA secondary classification as 'Soothing & Restorative' is given a score of 0.4, due to the workout's emphasis on being part of a 'comeback' and 'breathe' type, which suggests a focus on recovery and gentle fitness building. The low intensity further supports this restorative quality. The lack of a highly structured or intense approach leads to the exclusion of spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined.'"
