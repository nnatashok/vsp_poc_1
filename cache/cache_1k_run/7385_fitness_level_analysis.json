Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is relatively short at 15 minutes, which typically aligns with lower energy expenditure. 'Everyday mobility exercises' are generally not intense and align with a low-intensity, Light effort level. Even with peppy background music, the energy and HIIT elements are absent, which firmly supports the Light classification. The Moderate score is minor, only accounting for any possible briskness in pace or additional movements that might offer slightly more effort for deconditioned users.",
