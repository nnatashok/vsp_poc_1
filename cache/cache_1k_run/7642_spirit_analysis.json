  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified strongly as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the 'faster pace' and focus on experienced level mat style Pilates, which emphasizes continuous movement and coordination. This is further supported by the pop and global hits playlist, typically encouraging a rhythmic flow. The presence of popular and upbeat songs like 'Big Energy' and 'About Damn Time' underscores this classification, with a score of 0.9.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' is also relevant due to the outdoor setting shown in the image. While it's a mat-based Pilates workout, the natural setting contributes to the adventurous spirit, leading to a score of 0.7.\n\nLastly, 'Structured & Disciplined' is assigned because Pilates inherently involves methodical and precise movements, especially at an advanced level. The term 'designed for an experienced level' reflects the need for disciplined practice, justifying a score of 0.6. This workout does not focus on high-intensity effort, so 'High-Energy & Intense' is not applicable."
