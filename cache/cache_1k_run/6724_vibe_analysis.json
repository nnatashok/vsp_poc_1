  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is focused on 'maintaining power at lower rhythms' and involves '1-minute intervals lowering in rhythm,' suggesting a controlled, steady effort that is characteristic of 'The Meditative Grind.' This matches the repetitive and focused nature of rowing sessions, emphasized by the reverse climb format, earning a score of 0.7. \n\nThe use of 'Love Today' and 'Relax, Take It Easy' from Indie Alternative and Global Hits stations introduces an uplifting energy. This aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave,' characterized by feel-good movement and a steady build, although the warm-up nature and lower rhythms reduce intensity, resulting in a score of 0.6. \n\nThe absence of high intensity elements or explosive challenges excludes vibes such as 'The Firestarter' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.' The musical and rhythmic emphasis helps align the workout with 'The Meditative Grind' rather than more intense or competitive vibes."
