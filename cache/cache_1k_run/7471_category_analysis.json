  "categoriesExplanation": "The title 'Upper Body Strength' and the description 'beginner friendly bodyweight exercises' strongly indicate that this workout falls under the 'Body weight' category, as it focuses on exercises using only the body as resistance. The mention of 'all beginner friendly bodyweight exercises' and the categorization 'On The Mat' points towards a floor exercise setting, justifying the secondary category of 'Mat'. The duration of 10 minutes and 44 seconds supports these categories as they suggest a concise and focused workout session. No equipment is listed, strengthening the likelihood of a bodyweight and mat-based routine. Other categories like 'Weight workout' are excluded due to the explicit mention of bodyweight exercises. The confidence level is high due to the explicit indicators provided in the metadata."
