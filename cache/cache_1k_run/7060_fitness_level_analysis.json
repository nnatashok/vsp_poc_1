  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout type 'row' generally dictates the technique difficulty to be Beginner or Intermediate according to Hydrow-specific rules. With the focus primarily on rowing and considering the format as 'Interval,' the movements are likely structured and consistent but may require some coordination due to interval changes. The use of an experienced instructor further implies guidance through potentially complex pacing, suggesting partial Intermediate classification, but primarily falling into Beginner due to the inherent simplicity of rowing motions.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 11:24 and an intensity level of 2 out of 3, the workout presents a moderately challenging physical demand. The interval format likely introduces periods of heightened intensity, contributing to a classification between Moderate and Challenging. Although the session may require significant effort due to intervals, the relatively short duration suggests it's better suited towards those not entirely deconditioned, aligning more closely with Moderate energy expenditure.",
