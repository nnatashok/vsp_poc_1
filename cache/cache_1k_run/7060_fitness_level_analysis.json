  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The 'Living Authentically Row' is classified under the 'row' workout type. Based on the Hydrow-specific rules, rowing workouts default to a Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty. The use of 'Interval' format suggests some coordination but remains in the Intermediate range when aligned with rowing. No advanced techniques or complex movements are indicated, supporting a score of 0.8 for Beginner and 0.6 for Intermediate, with high confidence due to clear metadata alignment.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The intensity level is rated 2 out of 3, and the workout duration is just over 11 minutes, suggesting a balance between light and moderate effort. The interval format and moderate max rhythm (26) imply some exertion but not highly intense. Thus, the effort difficulty is moderately aligned with Light (0.4), strongly with Moderate (0.7), and moderately with Challenging (0.5) due to short duration and moderate intensity cues.",
