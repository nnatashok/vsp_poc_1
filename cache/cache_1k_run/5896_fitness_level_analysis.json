  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized under 'row', which typically ranges from Beginner to Intermediate. Given the 'breathe' format focusing on rhythm and the simplicity implied by the 'climb' format, the movement complexity is low, aligning strongly with Beginner (0.8), with a small consideration for Intermediate (0.2) due to the rhythmic coordination required. Thus, technique remains accessible for most beginners with low entry-level skills.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is short, at 11 minutes, with a 1 out of 3 intensity level marked as 'breathe', indicating a gentle pace. This suggests the primary focus is on rhythm control rather than physical exertion, aligning well with Light difficulty (0.7). However, the 'climb' and use of rhythm coordination imply there may be slightly more exertion than the simplest workouts, allowing for a modest Moderate score (0.3).",
