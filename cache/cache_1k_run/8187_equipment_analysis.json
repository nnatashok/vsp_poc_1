  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout type and category 'On The Mat' and 'restore' suggest the primary equipment needed is a Mat with very high confidence (0.9), as these workouts typically involve floor exercises focused on stretching and relaxation. The mention of 'Yoga blocks optional' in the description, and the visible block in the image, indicates that Blocks can be used optionally, warranting a moderate confidence level (0.4) as they support some exercises but are not essential. The focus on gentle stretching and tension release aligns with these equipment suggestions."
