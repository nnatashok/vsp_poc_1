  "categoriesConfidence": 0.85,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout emphasizes 'Glutes + Hip Strength with Mini Band', indicating a focus on targeted strength exercises for the lower body, aligning well with the 'Body weight' category, especially since bodyweight workouts often include the use of additional resistance like mini bands. The description mentions \"Engage your hips, glutes, and core\", clearly suggesting exercises relying on body weight and minimal added resistance. The score of 0.8 reflects the strong emphasis on bodyweight exercises reinforced by the presence of the mini band.\n\nThe workout is labeled as 'On The Mat', confirming that the exercises are performed on a mat, typically without large equipment, validating the 'Mat' category. The score of 0.7 indicates that while mat work is significant, it is somewhat secondary to the main focus of strength using body weight. The environment (overlooking the hills of greater Dublin) and pop music like 'Sweater Weather', 'Levitating' and 'She's All I Wanna Be' suggest a workout atmosphere typical for general mat exercises.\n\nOther categories like 'Weight workout' are not appropriate as there's no mention of weights or gym equipment beyond the mini band."
