  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as a 'row' type with a 'breathe' format, generally focusing on maintaining a rhythmic pace rather than intensive or complex rowing techniques. Given the 'Beginner' user fitness level requirement and the emphasis on building rhythm at a jog pace, the movements are likely straightforward, aligning strongly with Beginner (score: 0.9). The possibility of some coordination involved in maintaining a rhythm gives it a moderate Intermediate score (score: 0.6), but the primary technique needs remain basic.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video is of short duration (11:17 minutes), focusing on a rhythm-building approach rather than high-intensity exercise, and is noted to be a 1 out of 3 on the intensity scale. These factors suggest a low energy expenditure suitable for complete beginners, aligning well with Light (0.7). A moderate level is possible due to continuous rowing movement, but the intended intensity and the 'breathe' category predominantly indicate a gentle difficulty level.",
