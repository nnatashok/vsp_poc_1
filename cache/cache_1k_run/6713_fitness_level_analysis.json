  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is categorized as a 'row' type, which, per classification guidelines, limits the technique difficulty to 'Beginner' or 'Intermediate'. The description suggests building rhythm at a jog pace without complex movement patterns, aligning with Beginner level. However, the incorporation of maintaining rhythm and pace introduces a minor aspect of coordination, justifying a slight inclusion of Intermediate level.",
