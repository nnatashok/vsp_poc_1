Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The absence of equipment and a focus on stretching exercises suggests minimal physical exertion, classifying the effort difficulty as 'Light'. The short duration of roughly 16 minutes supports this classification, indicating a workout that would not significantly challenge energy expenditure even for less fit individuals. The 'stretching' nature hints at a potential 'Moderate' level due to the involved muscle engagement, but this is a minor aspect.",
