  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is classified under the 'row' category. According to Hydrow-specific rules, rowing workouts generally have a technique difficulty level of either Beginner or Intermediate. The mention of climbing in intensity suggests some complexity, but the rowing format typically requires minimal advanced coordination. Thus, a stronger alignment towards Beginner is supported by its straightforward nature, but including Intermediate as well due to the workout's climbing aspect and rhythm coordination involved.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 16 minutes and a medium intensity level marked as 2 out of 3, this workout is relatively brief but maintains a significant effort due to the climbing intensity format. Rhythmic elements at a max rhythm of 28 contribute to more physical demand, aligning it closer to Moderate with some elements of Challenging, particularly for individuals in poor shape.",
