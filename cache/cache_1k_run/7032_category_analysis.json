  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Indoor rowing' with a score of 0.9, reflecting very strong confidence in this category. The title 'Climbing Intervals Row' explicitly includes the word 'Row,' strongly indicating that this is a rowing machine workout. Additionally, the description mentions intervals and maintaining a 'goal split,' which are common elements of rowing workouts aimed at improving performance on the ergometer. The use of the term 'intervals' and the focus on maintaining rhythm suggest structured rowing training rather than more relaxed cardio or stretching classes. The metadata consistently points to indoor rowing as the main focus of this workout. Other categories such as HIIT could potentially apply due to the interval nature, but given the explicit focus on rowing, they are less appropriate."
