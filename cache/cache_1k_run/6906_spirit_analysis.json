  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout 'Climbing Intervals Row' embodies several energetic qualities, but primarily aligns with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit (0.8 score) due to the rowing being conducted on a body of water. The outdoor setting contributes significantly to the adventure aspect.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' (0.7 score) spirit is evident from the interval format ('4' and 3' pieces') and described intensity level ('Challenge yourself') which implies a demanding and vigorous session aimed at increasing performance and stamina.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' (0.6 score) is also relevant as the description highlights 'rhythm,' suggesting a synchronized or music-driven pace throughout the workout. The playlist, featuring energetic and popular tracks from genres like Hip Hop and R&B, supports the rhythmic flow notion.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the focus on intensity and rhythm rather than recovery or strict training protocols."
