  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's 10-minute duration and description as a 'cool down' suggest minimal physical intensity, appropriate for a Light rating, suitable for users completing strenuous sessions. Even during the row segments, the use of a steady pace indicates a low energy expenditure. However, a small portion of the workout consists of rowing, prompting a minor consideration for a Moderate rating due to slightly increased effort compared to non-exercise stretching.",
