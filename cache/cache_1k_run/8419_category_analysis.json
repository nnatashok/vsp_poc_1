  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is categorized primarily as Indoor Rowing. The title, \"Instructional: Drive Through Your Feet,\" and the description focus on a 'legs-only drill,' which is specific to rowing where proper foot placement and form are crucial. The use of 'drive through your feet' is a common term in rowing to emphasize the leg drive phase. The mention of 'category: row' in the metadata further supports this classification. The presence of a specific instructor, Nick Karwoski, also hints at a specialized focus often seen in structured rowing workouts. The workout's warm-up type and duration (5:47 minutes) align with an instructional rowing drill session. Other categories like Stretching or Yoga are excluded since there are no elements of flexibility or mind-body practices mentioned. The confidence level is high (0.85), with the score for Indoor Rowing set at 0.9, as the indicators are strong and explicit throughout the metadata."
