  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly categorized as 'row' and titled 'Power Row,' indicating the central use of a rowing machine. The description mentions building energy and power during intervals, a common rowing machine workout format. Additionally, although a real rowing activity on the Charles River is referenced, the platform's focus suggests indoor rowing equipment. Therefore, the confidence in requiring a rowing machine is very high."
