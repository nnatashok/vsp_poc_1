  "vibesExplanation": "The \"Pop Intervals Row\" workout features a gradually increasing rhythm over 4-minute intervals, suggesting a steady, repetitive activity common in 'The Meditative Grind.' The chosen music genre of pop, accompanied by songs like 'Be Alright' and 'Hands To Myself,' supports an elevating, feel-good experience associated with 'The Endorphin Wave.' The categorization as 'breathe' and an intensity level of 1 out of 3 indicate a more relaxed, intentional pace, aligning with 'The Zen Flow.' The combination of these elements suggests a focus on rhythm, steady progress, and a pleasant musical backdrop. While the pop music introduces elements of energy, the intensity and description focus more on endurance and steadiness, typical of a meditative approach."
