  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout belongs to the 'row' category, which strongly implies the use of a rowing machine. The title \"Finding Balance Row\" further suggests the rowing theme, aligning with the category type. The workout description referencing 'life on and off the water' reinforces the focus on rowing, indicating that a rowing machine is required. Although the image shows real rowing, the indoor workout would typically require a rowing machine."
