  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Catch Compression Row' focuses on learning the proper catch position and practicing drills, indicating a technical and skill-building focus suitable for 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe. This is supported by terms like 'technique' and 'format: technique', with a score of 0.7 due to explicit emphasis on improving rowing skills. \n\nThe steady rhythm (max 30) and focus on repetition suggest a meditative aspect, aligned with 'The Meditative Grind', hence a score of 0.5. This vibe is slightly less dominant but present due to the continuous practice implied by the descriptions.\n\nThe workout's overall duration and moderate intensity, along with upbeat pop-punk music, hint at a moderate 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe. The playlist contributes to a feel-good energy, justifying a score of 0.4 as it's less central but enhancing the experience.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Groove Session' or 'The Warrior Workout' were excluded due to lack of high-intensity or dance elements."
