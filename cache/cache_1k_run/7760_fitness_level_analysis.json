  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This is a short (5-minute 44-second) cool-down session, characterized by slow rhythm and controlled movements. Given the context of 'how low can you go' and emphasis on relaxation, energy expenditure is very low. The playlist's 'Chill low' and 'Cool/Downtempo' reinforce the relaxed nature of the workout, aligning very strongly with 'Light' effort. Hence, the score is extremely high at 0.95.",
