  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty primarily aligns with Beginner level due to the nature of rowing workouts, which inherently fit within Beginner or Intermediate categories for technique. The workout emphasizes fundamental rowing skills, such as leg power and hand speed during intervals, which typically do not involve complex coordination beyond basic rowing form. Therefore, it fits well within a Beginner level at 0.8 score. There is some alignment with an Intermediate level due to the focus on power and speed elements, but since it's designed for Beginners, it doesn't reach the complexity required for a strong Intermediate classification.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Despite being a short workout with an intensity level of 1 out of 3, the interval format with a focus on power suggests a Moderate effort difficulty. The rhythm max at 26 and the power-focused intervals increase energy expenditure beyond a Light classification. However, given the short duration and overall description, it moderately aligns with Moderate difficulty at a score of 0.7. The Light difficulty score of 0.5 reflects the lower intensity rating and short duration.",
