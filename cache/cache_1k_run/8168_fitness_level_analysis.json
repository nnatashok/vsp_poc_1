Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short, 5-minute warm-up with no specified intense movements or high rhythm. Given that it focuses on warming up rather than high-intensity exercises, it aligns very strongly with a Light effort difficulty. The Moderate rating is less likely but considered due to the technical focus which might engage muscles more than a standard leisurely activity.",
