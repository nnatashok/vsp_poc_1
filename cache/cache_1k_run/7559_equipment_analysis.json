  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled 'Beginner Core Pilates' suggests that it is a mat-based pilates routine, as indicated by both the 'On The Mat' category and the description specifying pilates exercises. The presence of a mat in the accompanying image and the classification under 'standard' and 'on-the-mat' categories further reinforce this. Pilates, particularly for core exercises, typically requires a mat to ensure comfort and proper support during floor exercises. Thus, there is very high confidence that a mat is needed for this workout."
