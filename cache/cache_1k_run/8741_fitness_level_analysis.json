Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of under 6 minutes and the categorization as a 'warm-up' suggest that the workout is fundamentally light in terms of energy expenditure, earning it a strong score for Light effort difficulty. The progression from rhythm 18 to 32+, while more demanding, is unlikely to elevate the overall effort to Moderate as the session is short and controlled, hence a moderate alignment score for Moderate.",
