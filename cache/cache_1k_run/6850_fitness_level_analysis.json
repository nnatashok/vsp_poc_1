  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "Given that the workout is categorized under 'row' within the Hydrow platform, the technique difficulty defaults predominantly to Beginner, as per the rule for rowing exercises. The description emphasizes generating power from the legs and holding a consistent pace, which adds a minimal level of complexity, justifying a slight score for Intermediate. However, the focus on rowing as a primary movement keeps the technique relatively simple, suitable for beginners.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.75,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is short (16 minutes and 15 seconds), and the description suggests a focus on consistent pacing rather than high intensity. With an intensity level of 1 out of 3, the workout is not overly physically demanding. While the interval format and use of terms like 'generating power' suggest some energy expenditure, the short duration and low-intensity cue align more strongly with a Light effort difficulty, but with a moderate aspect due to the rowing intervals.",
