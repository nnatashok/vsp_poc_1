  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Club 30 Row' primarily aligns with 'The Firestarter' vibe, given the workout's structure of 30 and 60-second high-intensity intervals and its classification as HIIT, which suggests a fast, explosive, and demanding experience. This is reinforced by the description's emphasis on stepping on the gas, indicating a need for speed and energy, earning it a score of 0.8.\n\nThe alignment with 'The Competitor' vibe is due to the instructor's background and motivating style. Aquil Abdullah's status as an Olympian and his ability to motivate participants to push hard aligns well with the competitive aspect, scoring 0.7 for this vibe.\n\nAlthough less dominant, there is a moderate connection to 'The Meditative Grind', as rowing inherently involves repetitive motions, which are meditative in nature. The intensity dictated as level 3 out of 3 also suggests a prolonged, focused effort, contributing to this vibe with a score of 0.5.\n\nOverall, the combination of high intensity, competition-driven coaching, and the rhythmic nature of rowing strongly supports these selected vibes."
