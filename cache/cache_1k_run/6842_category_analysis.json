  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Feel Good Cool-Down', described as a cool-down session with indicators such as 'mood-boosting' and 'Steady' format. These suggest it follows another primary workout, serving as a transition to lower intensity. The presence of 'Max rhythm: 22' points to rowing, suggesting involvement of a rowing machine, aligning with the 'row' tag in the categories and confirming 'Indoor rowing'. The category 'Cool Down' is not a standard classification, but indicates low intensity, which can encompass elements of light movement found in 'Stretching'. The playlist (Beach Boys, Train) supports a relaxed, calming session suitable for cool-down. No explicit mention of stretching or flexibility exercises limits full confidence in 'Stretching', hence a moderate score is given. The overall lack of typical structure found in yoga or breathing exercises excludes those categories. Other potential categories like 'Mat', 'Meditation', or 'Breathing exercises' were excluded due to stronger evidence supporting rowing."
