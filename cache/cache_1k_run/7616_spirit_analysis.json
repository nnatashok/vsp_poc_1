  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is mainly classified under 'Structured & Disciplined' due to its clear focus on technique and interval format, suggesting a methodical approach (score: 0.8). The emphasis on technique every 10 minutes indicates a disciplined progression. 'Outdoor & Adventure' is also relevant as the session is conducted on Lake Tahoe, providing a natural setting that aligns with the outdoor element (score: 0.7). Finally, 'Soothing & Restorative' is somewhat present, as the moderate intensity level and the use of blues/jazz music suggest a calming experience (score: 0.5). This option reflects the more relaxed pacing and the categorized 'breathe' type of workout, which also hints at a restorative aspect."
