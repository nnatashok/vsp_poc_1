  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Chicago Bridges Row' and the description involves rowing through Downtown Chicago, indicating a rowing-focused workout. The category explicitly includes 'row', which necessitates the use of a rowing machine for an indoor workout representation. The image confirms outdoor rowing, but for indoor replication, a rowing machine is essential. Given this metadata and the category type, the confidence for needing a rowing machine is very high (1.0)."
