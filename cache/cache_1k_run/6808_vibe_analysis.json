  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Hip-Opening Flow,' which indicates a fluid, intentional practice that aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The setting at the Royal Palm Estate in Miami enhances the calming environment, appropriate for a 'Zen Flow.' The use of chill and downtempo music supports this vibe, providing a relaxed and grounding experience. \n\n'The Reboot Workout' is also applicable given the gentle nature of the flow, promoting a refreshing and restorative movement. The short duration and specific focus on hip opening further support a refreshing vibe.\n\nLastly, 'The Meditative Grind' fits due to the repetitive and focused quality of the flow, encouraging inward concentration. The absence of equipment and the mat-based nature reinforce a low-intensity, meditative approach.\n\nOther intense or competitive vibes were excluded due to the lack of high-energy elements and the emphasis on gentle opening and relaxation."
