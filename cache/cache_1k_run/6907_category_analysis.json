  "categoriesExplanation": "The video titled 'Intentional Cool-Down' with a description focusing on 'steadily row' strongly indicates an 'Indoor rowing' workout category. This matches the rowing-related tags and the use of a rowing machine, which is central to the activity. The score of 0.9 reflects this strong presence. Additionally, the workout's purpose as a \"cool down\" and format as 'steady' suggests it might include elements of 'Stretching' or other low-intensity activities to aid in relaxation and recovery. Although there isn't explicit stretching mentioned, the overlap of similar physiological goals justifies a 'Stretching' category with a moderate score of 0.55. The ambiguity in explicitly defining stretching routines in the metadata slightly lowers the confidence to 0.85. Other categories like 'Yoga' or 'Meditation' are excluded due to lack of relevant indicators, despite the relaxed nature of a cool-down routine."
