Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 11 minutes, combined with the term 'restore' and relaxing music genres, suggests very low energy expenditure, appropriate for a Light effort level. The restorative nature implies a gentle routine, likely consisting of stretches or relaxation poses without any intense physical exertion. This is very suitable for deconditioned users or complete beginners, thus aligning strongly with the Light category. A marginal score for Moderate is given to reflect any potential slight physical exertion beyond complete rest.",
