Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of the workout is 21 minutes and 5 seconds, which is not overly long. As a 'power flow' in a yoga context, it involves continuous movement but typically without high-intensity cardio elements, suggesting a Moderate level of effort. The lack of dynamic jumps or equipment that are typical of higher effort levels supports this classification. The music genre of Chill and Downtempo further indicates a relaxed, steady pace conducive to a Moderate effort level, rather than intense physical demands.",
