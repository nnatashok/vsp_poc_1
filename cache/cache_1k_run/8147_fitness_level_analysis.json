Movements can be scaled in complexity, and users are expected to modify techniques based on their capability. Therefore, all difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert are assigned equal suitability with a score of 1.0.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is only 10 minutes and 44 seconds, which is relatively short, contributing to a light overall effort demand. As this is a core-focused Pilates session, the movements are likely low-impact with sustained engagement rather than high intensity or rapid cardio. The absence of equipment further suggests minimal energy expenditure. Consequently, the effort difficulty is predominantly light, suitable for beginners, but with minor inclusion of moderate effort due to core engagement that might be slightly challenging for very deconditioned individuals.",
