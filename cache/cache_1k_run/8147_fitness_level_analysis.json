  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as a 'Beginner Core Pilates' session, specifically designed for beginners. Pilates generally involves a series of controlled movements that can range from basic to advanced. Since this is a beginner session, it likely emphasizes fundamental pilates exercises that require minimal coordination, justifying a high score for 'Beginner' technique difficulty (0.8). 'Intermediate' is considered at a lower score (0.2) to account for any slightly more challenging elements, although the focus remains on beginners.",
