  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is relatively short at just over 20 minutes, which reduces overall energy expenditure. 'Classical Pilates' is known for controlled and deliberate movements rather than high-intensity efforts. These characteristics align it with Light effort, though the constant movement and focus required could make it slightly more demanding, hence a modest Moderate score.",
