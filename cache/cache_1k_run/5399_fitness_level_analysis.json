  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the 'Drive' category and 'row' exercise type, which inherently aligns with either Beginner or Intermediate technique difficulty according to Hydrow's specific rules. The 'Drive' designation suggests a stronger focus on technical execution but remains confined to intermediate complexity due to rowing's natural form demands and the advanced pacing indicated by interval rhythms.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is supported by the high intensity level marker of '3 out of 3'. The use of HIIT format with high rhythm intervals (26-32) in combination with it being a 'Drive' workout indicates a highly demanding energy expenditure. Although the duration is moderately short at 11 minutes 38 seconds, the continuous high-effort intervals contribute to an extreme level of intensity for less fit individuals.",
