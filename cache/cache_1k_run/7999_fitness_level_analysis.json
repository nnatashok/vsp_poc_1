  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves rowing, a straightforward exercise typically fitting a Beginner to Intermediate level in technique difficulty. The description and format 'Climb' imply some variability but still suggest simple rowing motions. No specific advanced rowing techniques or coordination-heavy movements are mentioned, suggesting strong alignment with Beginner (score: 0.9) and some with Intermediate (score: 0.6) due to the rhythm variation.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 31 minutes with a climbing format indicating sustained effort over time. Although the intensity is rated 1 out of 3, the 'rhythm increase' and '8-minute climbs' suggest consistent moderate effort, suitable for deconditioned users. This aligns with Moderate effort (score: 0.75), though the total duration and rhythm shifts could challenge less fit users, slightly aligning with Challenging effort (score: 0.45).",
