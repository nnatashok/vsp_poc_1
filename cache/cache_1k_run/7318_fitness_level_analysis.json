  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a warm-up with a short duration of 5 minutes and 45 seconds, indicating a Light difficulty level. However, the inclusion of '10-power strokes' suggests brief, moderately intense exertion, slightly increasing the effort demand. Despite this, the interval nature and the overall intention of a warm-up support a prevailing Light classification, with a hint of Moderate for energy expenditure engaged during power strokes.",
