  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The activity is a warm-up with a short duration of 5 minutes and 45 seconds. Although it involves power strokes intended to elevate the heart rate, the brief duration limits energy expenditure, aligning it predominantly with the 'Light' category (score 0.7). The interval format slightly increases the effort, making the 'Moderate' level a partial match (score 0.3) but falls short of more strenuous levels.",
