  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, titled 'Just Go Row', is explicitly categorized under 'row', strongly indicating that a rowing machine is necessary. The description further supports this by emphasizing rowing, as instructor James Dietz brings 'decades of rowing wisdom' to the session. The high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format and the goal to 'hit new speeds' also suggest a rowing machine is integral to achieve these objectives. Therefore, the confidence in requiring a rowing machine is very high, at 1.0, because the workout is specifically designed around rowing activities."
