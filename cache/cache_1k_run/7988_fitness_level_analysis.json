  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified under the rowing category with a type 'breathe', which typically emphasizes rhythm and pacing over technical rowing skills. Given the description with simple stroke rate intervals and a format labeled as 'standard row', the movements required are relatively straightforward, aligning with a Beginner technique difficulty. The Intermediate score is due to interval variation, which may require some minor stroke adjustments.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is approximately 21 minutes and includes interval training, making it slightly more engaging than continuously steady rowing. However, with the intensity level noted as 1 out of 3 and the moderate stroke rate (18-24 SPM), the physical demand is not high, aligning closest with a Light effort. The structure with intervals slightly nudges it towards Moderate for less fit users.",
