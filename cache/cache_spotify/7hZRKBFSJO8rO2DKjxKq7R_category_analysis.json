  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist title 'songs that give me the best runners high' directly suggests its intended use for running workouts, which is further reinforced by the description mentioning its role in marathon training. This indicates an extremely strong presence of the 'Running' category, justified with a score of 0.9. The additional tag 'running playlist' corroborates this focus, placing confidence in the Running classification at 0.9. \n\nThe 'Treadmill' category is also relevant, scoring 0.7, as treadmill workouts are often associated with running training. The high-energy and danceability of tracks like 'SOS' by Rihanna and 'Can't Hold Us' by Macklemore suggest they are suitable for maintaining a consistent pace on a treadmill, supporting this secondary classification.\n\nShoots plains for the 'Walking' category due to the playlist's focus on running and high-energy music, which lacks the moderate intensity characteristic of walking workouts."
