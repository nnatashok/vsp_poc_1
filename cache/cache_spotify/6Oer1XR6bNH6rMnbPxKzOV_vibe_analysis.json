  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist 'Top 100 Motivational Songs in The World!' suits several high-energy and uplifting vibes. The first most suitable vibe, 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse,' receives a score of 0.7 due to the beat-driven and fluid nature of tracks like 'Unstoppable' by Sia and 'Fight Song' by Rachel Platten, which have strong tempos (e.g., 174 BPM) and motivating lyrics that align with steady, powerful running sessions. The combination of high-energy music and positive lyrics fits well with synchronized movement suitable for running or power walks.\n\nSecond, 'The Endorphin Wave' is scored at 0.65, as the playlist's uplifting and motivational tracks, like 'I Can' by Fearless Soul and 'Keep Your Head Up' by Andy Grammer, focus on themes of resilience and personal growth, which would foster a feel-good atmosphere for prolonged runs or enjoyable scenic jogs.\n\nFinally, 'The Adrenaline Rush' is applicable with a 0.6 score. The presence of dynamic songs such as 'Can't Hold Us' by Macklemore, which have unpredictable, intense rhythms, supports varied pacing and the spur-of-the-moment challenges that characterize adrenaline-boosting runs. Despite the playlist containing elements of multiple vibes, the consistency in motivational messaging across songs solidifies these vibes as primary classifications."
