  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'Running Motivation 2025 - Techno Running Music' is clearly intended for running workouts, as indicated by the playlist name, which includes 'Running Motivation' and 'Running Music'. The description further reinforces this with phrases like 'Best Running Playlist 2025!', 'to fuel your runs', and 'high-energy tracks', all of which strongly suggest it's tailored to running. The inclusion of high-energy techno tracks by artists like Alok and Charlotte De Witte aligns with the high-energy and motivational soundtracks typically suitable for running. Tracks with high BPM, such as 'Vois sur ton chemin - Techno Mix' (138 BPM), support an energetic running pace.\n\nThe 'Treadmill' category is also applicable, scoring 0.6, because the music's high energy and fast-paced beats are suitable for treadmill workouts. However, the primary emphasis on running outdoors is more pronounced.\n\nThe 'Walking' category was excluded due to the high energy and fast tempo inappropriate for moderate walking, which demands a lower tempo and more relaxed beats."
