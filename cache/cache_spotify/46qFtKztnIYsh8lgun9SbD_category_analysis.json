  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'Cozy Kpop' is explicitly described as a 'chill playlist of Korean Pop' that is 'Perfect to listen to while walking, studying, enjoying a cup of coffee, or simply relaxing at home.' The mention of 'walking' in the description is a strong indicator that this playlist is suitable for walking workouts, especially given its 'chill' nature, which aligns with moderate activity like walking. The query used, 'chill walking playlist,' further reinforces this classification. Hence, Walking is the primary category with a high score of 0.8, reflecting its strong presence.\n\nWhile not explicitly designed for running, the playlist's moderate energy and steady rhythm in many tracks, like 'Bookmark' and 'Spring Memories,' could potentially support lighter running, reflected in the Running category score of 0.4. However, the primary intent appears to be leisure and relaxation rather than rigorous physical activity, making Running a secondary possibility rather than a primary classification.\n\nThe playlist is not meant specifically for treadmills or vigorous running, which is why the Treadmill category was excluded. The relaxation aspect also suggests activities beyond workouts, but Walking remains the most fitting workout classification based on available data. Overall, this analysis is based on explicit mentions and implied usage context within the playlist's description and track characteristics."
