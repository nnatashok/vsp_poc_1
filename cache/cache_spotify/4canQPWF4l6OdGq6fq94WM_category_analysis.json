  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist titled 'Top 100 Running Songs' explicitly suggests its use for running, as both the title and the description emphasize music for running workouts. The tracks are upbeat, energetic, and feature popular, high-energy songs such as 'Runaway Baby' by Bruno Mars and 'Crazy In Love' by Beyonc\u00e9. The high BPM and danceability of many of these tracks are well-suited for maintaining rhythm during running, supporting the 'Running' category with very high confidence (score: 0.9).\n\nThe presence of electronic and pop tracks that maintain a consistent beat also aligns with activities like treadmill running, where a steady pace is crucial, justifying a strong score for the 'Treadmill' category (score: 0.7). Given these factors, there is a high overall confidence in this classification. The playlist lacks any explicit cues for walking or low-intensity activities, thus excluding the 'Walking' category."
