  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'Steven's Walking Music' is explicitly tailored for walking, as evidenced by the playlist name, description, and query terms such as 'chill walking playlist' which directly indicate its intended use for walking. The description emphasizes a relaxed and leisurely atmosphere, suitable for 'long walks,' which aligns perfectly with the 'Walking' category. The genre and musical elements of the tracks like Chillstep, Downtempo, Chillhop, and moderate BPM values provide the ideal backdrop for a walking workout. Given the clarity and specificity of the playlist context, it scores a 1.0 for the Walking category, reflecting extremely high confidence. Other categories such as Running or Treadmill are not applicable due to the explicit focus on walking."
