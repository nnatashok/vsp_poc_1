  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Best Christian Workout Mix 2025' predominantly supports high-energy and intense activities, as it features fast-paced, uplifting tracks with a motivational tone suitable for vigorous exercises. The inclusion of artists such as TobyMac and Tauren Wells, known for their energetic Christian pop tunes, aligns with a high-energy spirit, making it ideal for sprints or intense workouts. This spirit scores a 0.75 due to several tracks with high BPM (e.g., 'Oh My Goodness' at 130 BPM) and positive, lively lyrics.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also applicable (score: 0.65) as the playlist's consistent upbeat tempo and major key tracks foster a meditative stride often characterized by rhythmic flow, ideal for steady pacing during running sessions.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is a secondary spirit due to the playlist's capacity for continuous motion it supports, further supported by tracks like 'GOOD DAY' with a moderate, yet consistent beat at roughly 120 BPM, ideal for maintaining tempo during runs.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, with a score of 0.5, considers the playlist's applicability for structured workouts like interval training, thanks to regular pace variations and song dynamics (e.g., 'Take It All Back' by Tauren Wells). The playlist's adaptability for multiple types of workouts (running, lifting, classes) emphasizes its structured utility.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit was excluded due to the energetic and uplifting nature of the tracks, which do not prioritize relaxation or cooldown dynamics."
