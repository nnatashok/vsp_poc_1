  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist is described as suitable for school, sleeping, shower, and walking, with a heavy emphasis on 'chill', which implies a relaxing and reflective nature. The vast majority of tracks, particularly those by Frank Ocean and other artists, have a medium to low energy level and reflect deeply introspective themes. The use of R&B and Soul also suggests a reflective, laid-back vibe suitable for contemplative walks, aligning with 'The Mindful Walk'. The mixed sentiments and slow tempos contribute to the 'The Deep Recharge', as these features align well with restorative and deep recovery experiences. The choice of music and overall tone are not aligned with energetic or rhythm-focused vibes, supporting the assigned scores. Other vibes such as 'The Reboot Workout' or 'The Sleep Prep' were considered but the playlist's versatile uses and emotional intensity lean towards 'The Deep Recharge'."
