  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist 'Running Motivation 2025' is designed to inspire and motivate fast-paced running, as indicated by the description 'Run better, run faster.' The tracklist features consistently high-energy tracks from electronic dance music (EDM) and house genres. Specific tracks like 'Seven Nation Army' by DJ Fluke and 'Prada' by cass\u00f6 demonstrate high energy and danceability with tempos above 120 BPM, ideal for pushing limits and sustaining a fast running pace. The upbeat and vibrant tempos with themes of empowerment and confidence fit the Primary Vibe 'The Firestarter' due to their suitability for explosive sprints and high-intensity running. Additionally, the unpredictability and intense rhythms in tracks such as 'Give It To Me - Full Vocal Mix' by Matt Sassari align with 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe, which supports dynamic pacing and terrain shifts. However, there is less focus on rhythmic synchronization or endurance pacing that would suggest 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' or 'The Endorphin Wave.' The overall confidence in this classification is high due to consistent evidence of energetic and motivating music cues."
