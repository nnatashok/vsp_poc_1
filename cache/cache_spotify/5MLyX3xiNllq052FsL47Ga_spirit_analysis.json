  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Jogging Music 2025 \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf51' is clearly crafted for running, as indicated by its title and description featuring terms like 'running music', 'workout', 'cardio', and specific references to motivating and electronic music. The tracklist includes numerous high-energy songs in genres like EDM and Tech House, with high BPM values often exceeding 128 bpm (e.g., 'LET'S GET FKD UP' by Alok at 160 bpm), fostering the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit with a score of 0.8 for supporting vigorous running sessions. The frequent use of driving beats and danceability rating supports a steady cadence necessary for rhythmic, trance-like activity, suggesting a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a score of 0.6. Despite a consistently upbeat and energetic atmosphere, there are elements of structured rhythm programs with consistent energy levels across tracks such as 'It Feels So Good' by Matt Sassari contributing to a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.4. Other spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the playlist's high tempo and indoor workout focus."
