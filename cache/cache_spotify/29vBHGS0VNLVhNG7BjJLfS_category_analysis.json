These tracks are popular anthems used for running due to their high energy, motivating messages, and suitable tempos.

Additionally, the search query 'running inspiration playlist' distinctly aligns with exercise for motivation purposes. Therefore, 'Running' receives a score of 0.85 for its strong alignment with the content's nature and purpose.
