  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist 'Epic Music for Running' primarily features epic, high-energy instrumental tracks that are well-suited to high-intensity running sessions. The description emphasizes inspiration and motivation, aiming to get your 'adrenaline pumping.' This aligns with the vibe 'The Adrenaline Rush,' given the focus on dynamic pacing and intense musical energy, which is evident in track titles like 'Overpowered' and 'Adrenaline Rush' by Cheryl B. Engelhardt. The overall high energy and dramatic tones suggested by genres such as Epic Hybrid Action Metal and Epic Orchestral Music further support this classification, reflecting unpredictable and intense rhythms for dynamic runs. \n\nThere is also a strong match for 'The Firestarter' vibe due to the playlist's suitability for power and short, explosive bursts of running, implied by intense and high-BPM tracks like 'Shiver Me Timpanis.' The tracks generally convey an explosive feel that can amplify short sprints, hence the score of 0.8 for this vibe. \n\nLastly, 'The Warrior Workout' vibe is appropriate given the epic, battle-themed nature of many track titles and descriptors ('Dragon Fighter,' 'Legendary'), which suggest vigorous, challenging workouts, scoring it 0.7. The playlist's cohesive high-energy tracks provide strong implicit indicators for this classification, albeit slightly less directly than for the other two vibes."
