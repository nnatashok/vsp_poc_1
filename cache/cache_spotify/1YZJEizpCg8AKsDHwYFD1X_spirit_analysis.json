  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'currently: hot girl walking' is likely designed for energetic walking based on the query used, 'energetic walking playlist.' The tracks are predominantly high in popularity and feature artists like The Weeknd, Drake, and Rihanna, known for their rhythmic, engaging, and mood-rich music, which provides a consistent beat suitable for maintaining a brisk walking pace. The playlist includes various tracks with medium to high energy and danceability, such as 'Starboy' (high music energy and danceability) and 'Can't Feel My Face' (known for strong rhythmic elements), supporting a steady rhythmic flow in walking. \n\nThe recurring use of songs with a consistent beat and rhythmic appeal favors the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.75), as these elements promote a synchronized walking experience.\n\nFurthermore, the consistent selection of artists with strong chart-topping presence implies a deliberate structure, aligning with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (score: 0.6), suitable for goal-oriented walking sessions focused on pace or distance. Both spirits are supported by the steady beats typical of R&B and pop tracks. \n\nAlternative spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' were not chosen, as the playlist aims more toward consistent rhythm than extreme intensity."
