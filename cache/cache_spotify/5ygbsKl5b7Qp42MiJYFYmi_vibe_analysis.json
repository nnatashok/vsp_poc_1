  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Rage Running Playlist' has strong indicators of being aligned with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe. The playlist is explicitly described as being for when you're 'fighting for your life,' suggesting high-intensity, even aggressive motivation appropriate for challenging workout sessions. Tracks like 'Lose Yourself,' 'Fighter,' and 'Till I Collapse' feature themes of overcoming adversity and pushing limits, which fit the 'unleash your inner beast' aspect of The Warrior Workout. Additionally, the playlist's high energy and motivational tracks align with The Firestarter, characterized by explosive, high-tempo tracks ideal for intense running activities. Songs such as 'Titanium' and 'Thunder' support this interpretation. However, The Warrior Workout fits more due to the playlist's explicit and consistent focus on endurance and resilience, hence a higher score is given to it."
