  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist '90s Walking Music' primarily fits the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to its consistent tempo across tracks like 'Vogue' by Madonna and 'Livin' la Vida Loca' by Ricky Martin, which support a steady walking pace through their danceable rhythms. This is supported by high danceability scores across multiple tracks, suggesting a flow-promoting nature. The 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is also present as the playlist's upbeat and nostalgic vibe can enhance an exploratory walking experience, evoking the energy of vibrant past decades, as seen in tracks like 'Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!' by Vengaboys. The 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is somewhat applicable due to high-energy tracks such as 'Pump Up The Jam' by Technotronic, but the playlist maintains a more moderate intensity overall. These choices reflect the energetic but consistent and rhythmic nature of the selected songs, while the potential for intense running intervals remains less emphasized. Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the playlist's focus on upbeat, energetic music designed for lively walking rather than relaxation or structured training."
