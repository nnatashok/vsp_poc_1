  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist is clearly intended for running workouts, as evidenced by its title 'Running Playlist 2025' and descriptions such as 'best Running Music 2025' and 'best music to run to'. These phrases strongly suggest a focus on supporting high-energy running activities. The descriptors in the metadata, like 'best Cardio playlist' and 'running beats', reinforce the association with running exercise by highlighting cardiovascular exertion levels consistent with running. The presence of 100 tracks with a BPM range of 120-150 suggests a progression suitable for maintaining a rhythmic running pace. \n\nAdditionally, there is some potential relevance for walking exercises, particularly brisk walking, due to the use of mid-range BPM which can support slightly less intense workouts like walking. However, due to the stronger alignment with running through language and implied intensity, the score for walking is lower but still relevant. The categories, therefore, are 'Running' with a high confidence and score of 0.9, and 'Walking' with a moderate confidence and score of 0.6. Other potential categories such as 'Treadmill' were considered less relevant due to the lack of any explicit indications towards indoor-specific workouts in the metadata."
