  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist title 'The Wanderer's Tape' and description explicitly indicate that it is a personal walking playlist meant for 'chill walking.' The mention of 'my walking playlist' in the description is a clear indicator that the playlist is intended for walking. The musical content supports this as the tracklist consists largely of 90s hip-hop and chill beats, which are suited to a moderate pace suitable for walking. While there is a high degree of confidence that this playlist is used for walking, the vibe and sentiment of the playlist, highlighted by themes of introspection and chill music, strongly align with walking as an activity. The lack of explicit references or high-energy tempo in the tracks confirms that it is not intended for running or treadmill workouts, thus excluding those categories. Therefore, the primary classification is 'Walking' with a high confidence score of 0.8."
