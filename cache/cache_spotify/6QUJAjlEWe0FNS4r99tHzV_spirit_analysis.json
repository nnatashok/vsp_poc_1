  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Chill Walking Vibes' is suitable for 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Flow & Rhythm' spirits. It is tagged as a 'chill walking playlist', indicating its purpose is to provide a calming experience. Many tracks are in the alternative and indie rock genre, which often feature medium energy, introspective lyrics, and a steady pace, promoting relaxed movement. Although some tracks have darker themes (e.g., The Neighbourhood tracks), their consistent medium energy and danceability levels suggest a grounding and rhythmic experience, suitable for a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The playlist's overall tempo is not intense enough for high-energy or structured workouts but aligns with more restorative, melodic, and consistent walking, ideal for emotional unwinding, thus scoring a strong 0.7 for 'Soothing & Restorative'. There is less intense variation in tempo and energy across tracks, supporting a 0.6 score for 'Flow & Rhythm'. There is no indication of 'High-Energy', 'Structured & Disciplined', or 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits due to the introspective, mellow nature of the music, consistent medium tempo, and lack of aggressive dynamics or adventurous themes."
