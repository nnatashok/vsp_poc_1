  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist, titled 'Jogging Music 2025 \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf51', explicitly indicates a focus on running, supported by metadata such as 'Running Music Hits', 'Songs To run to', and multiple references to running-related activities like 'Correr' and 'Running playlist'. Most tracks are within a high BPM range, typical of running playlists aimed at maintaining a vigorous pace. Additional descriptions like 'Motivation Mix', 'Electronic Running', and 'Workout' all point toward a high-energy playlist suitable for running workouts, both outdoor and indoor, rather than walking. The frequent mention of 'Running', 'Motivation', and 'Workout' in the description further cements this categorization, making running the evident central characteristic. However, despite mentions of 'Spinning' and 'Cardio', these activities are less prominent in the context of the playlist's overall theme, allowing them to be excluded from the primary focus."
