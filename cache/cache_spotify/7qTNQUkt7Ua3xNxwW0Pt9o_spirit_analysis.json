  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Best walking songs' is designed for an energetic walking experience. The tracklist features a collection of iconic R&B, Soul, Disco, and Pop classics known for their strong rhythms and positive vibes. Tracks like Aretha Franklin's 'Respect', Gloria Gaynor's 'I Will Survive', and Sam & Dave's 'Soul Man' have high energy and danceability with clear beats, perfect for syncing walking strides, indicating a strong match with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, scored at 0.8 for its steady tempo-driven quality. \n\nThe playlist's reliance on timeless, uplifting songs that resonate with a scenic, feel-good aura aligns it with the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit as well, scored at 0.6, as it enhances the experience of a joyful, exploratory walk. The selection of feel-good tracks also supports a mild 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, scored at 0.2, with its emphasis on positivity and enjoyment, providing a light emotional uplift.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded since the playlist lacks the extreme tempo or structured training focus required for those categories."
