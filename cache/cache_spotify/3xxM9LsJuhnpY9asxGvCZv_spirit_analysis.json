  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'summer walking playlist' prominently aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, supported by its consistent tempo and upbeat nature designed for walking. The name and tracks like 'Pocketful of Sunshine' and 'Brighter Than The Sun' maintain a relaxed but steady flow, ideal for a rhythmic walking experience, justifying a score of 0.75. 'Outdoor & Adventure' fits moderately given the playlist's summery, outdoor-friendly feel, enhanced by tracks like 'Walking On A Dream' and 'Brazil,' which suit exploratory walking, scoring 0.65. 'Soothing & Restorative' was considered but scores low (0.3) due to the energetic nature of the music, lacking the gentleness typical of a restorative playlist. The playlist isn't high-energy or structured, thus excluding related spirits."
