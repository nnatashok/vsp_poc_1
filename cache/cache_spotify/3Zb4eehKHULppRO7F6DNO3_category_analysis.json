  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist is explicitly titled '80s Walking playlist,' directly indicating that it is intended for use during walking workouts. This is supported by the query used, 'energetic walking playlist.' The selected tracks are well-known 80s hits with generally high danceability and energy levels, which are commonly associated with maintaining a moderate, consistent pace suitable for walking workouts. Tracks like 'Sweet Dreams' and 'Maniac,' with their high energy and danceability, support brisk walking. The playlist's focus on an 'energetic' vibe aligns with more intense or brisk styles of walking, which can be motivating for both beginners and those recovering from more intensive training. Given this explicit and theme-aligned focus on walking, other categories like Running or Treadmill are excluded, as there are no indications of running or treadmill-specific use in the metadata or playlists."
