This aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, as the music is uplifting, helping to sustain momentum, though some songs like 'RAYE - Escapism' have a darker tone, which slightly reduces the score.\n\nAdditionally, the playlist's consistent beat-driven nature with many remixes and high-energy tracks aligns well with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe. The EDM tracks like 'Pumpin Blood - The Chainsmokers Remix' and 'Move Your Body' ensure a steady, energizing rhythm ideal for syncing with running strides, further supporting this classification.
