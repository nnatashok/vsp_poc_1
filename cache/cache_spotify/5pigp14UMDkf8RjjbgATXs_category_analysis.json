  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'KEEP IT FIT' is explicitly labeled as a 'Running/gym playlist,' which indicates a strong focus on running, both outdoor and treadmill. The inclusion of energetic, high-tempo tracks like Major Lazer's 'Roll the Bass' and high-energy tunes from artists like Yeat and Kendrick Lamar suggests a high-intensity setting typical for running environments. The tracks exhibit high energy and danceability, suitable for maintaining motivation and rhythm during a run. The description emphasizes inspiration and motivation, crucial for running workouts. Given the explicit mention of 'gym,' the playlist could also cater to indoor treadmill running, scoring 0.7 for Treadmill. Walking is not explicitly supported by the metadata, as the playlist's intensity and energy do not align with a moderate walking pace, excluding it as a main category."
