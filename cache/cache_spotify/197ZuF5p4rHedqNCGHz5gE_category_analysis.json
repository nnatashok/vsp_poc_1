  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist is explicitly designed for walking workouts, as indicated by the title 'My Cardio Walking Workout Playlist \ud83d\udcaa' and the description mentioning it's used while walking and working out. The inclusion of keywords like 'energetic walking playlist' further reinforces this, leading to a very high confidence (1.0) for the Walking category. The tracks selected are uptempo Pop, RnB, and Rap songs from the 2000s and 2010s, with high energy and danceability, which can also support light running or jogging exercises. Therefore, there is moderate applicability to the Running category, with a score of 0.6. Other categories such as Treadmill were not chosen due to the lack of specific indications of treadmill usage, although they may also be used for indoor cardio. Overall, the strong focus on walking justifies this classification."
