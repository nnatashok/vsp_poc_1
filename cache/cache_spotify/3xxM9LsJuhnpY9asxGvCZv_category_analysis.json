  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist is named 'summer walking playlist,' explicitly indicating its primary use for walking workouts. The description and query further reinforce the focus on 'chill walking,' suggesting moderate intensity suitable for brisk walking activities rather than high-intensity running. Most tracks have high energy, danceability, and positive valence, aligning with motivational and enjoyable workouts. There is some potential crossover with 'Running,' particularly for those doing light jogging or using this playlist to warm up, as indicated by the presence of high-energy and popular tracks like 'Walking On A Dream' and 'Unwritten.' These characteristics justify a minor score for 'Running.' However, there is significant alignment with a walking context, supported by the track analysis and playlist metadata, resulting in high confidence and a strong score of 0.9 for the 'Walking' category."
