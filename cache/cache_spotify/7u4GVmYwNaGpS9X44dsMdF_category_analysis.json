  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist is explicitly titled 'HGW Hot Girl Walk,' which directly signifies that it is intended for walking exercises. The description further clarifies that it is designed for a '4 mile, outdoor walk/hike,' focusing on themes of reflection and empowerment. The presence of terms like 'walk,' 'focus on gratitude,' and 'goals' reinforces the intention for leisurely, reflective walks. The large number of high-energy tracks, particularly pop and pop-rock, suggests a motivational and upbeat tempo ideal for brisk walking. While there are elements that could indirectly support outdoor running, such as the energetic music selection, the playlist's primary purpose as a walking/hiking companion is explicitly defined in the metadata. Therefore, the 'Walking' category is assigned with a high score of 0.9, reflecting strong, clear indicators. Other categories, such as 'Running' or 'Treadmill,' were excluded due to lack of specific mention or direct implication in the metadata."
