  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Millennial Running Mix' is classified primarily under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit with a score of 0.9. This classification is supported by the high-energy tracks such as 'Born This Way' by Lady Gaga, 'Low' by Flo Rida, and 'Some Nights' by fun., all of which have fast tempos, upbeat vibes, and are ideal for boosting adrenaline. The high popularity of these tracks indicates their widespread appeal and suitability for motivating runs. The playlist consists of 126 tracks that frequently use party-themed, empowering, and celebratory lyrics, aligning well with the intense spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is scored at 0.6 due to the consistent danceable beats across tracks such as 'Gold Digger' by Kanye West and 'Club Can't Handle Me' by Flo Rida. These tracks are not only high energy but also have rhythms that enable syncing with stride, supporting continuous and steady motion. While the playlist includes some introspective and mixed sentiment tracks like 'Some Nights', their anthemic, energetic production still aligns more with high-energy running than soothing or structured training. The focus on empowerment and confidence further excludes 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits as primary classifications."
