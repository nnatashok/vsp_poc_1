  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist titled 'Fast Tempo Walking Songs' is designed for an energetic walking experience. The name itself indicates a focus on maintaining a brisk pace, which aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. This is supported by the selection of tracks with high BPMs (120-132), major modes, and high danceability ratings, indicating a smooth, beat-driven consistency suitable for syncing walks to music.\n\nThe inclusion of popular, high-energy tracks like 'Moves Like Jagger', 'TiK ToK', and 'California Gurls' also suggests a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. These tracks have uplifting, fast-paced qualities and high energy levels, encouraging vigorous movement.\n\nAdditionally, the playlist's thematic focus on songs that facilitate a fast tempo and upbeat mood implies a 'Structured & Disciplined' aspect, as it is constructed with the intent of maintaining a consistent walking pace for workouts. However, the absence of explicit interval training cues or pacing instructions reduces the score for this spirit.\n\nOverall, the playlist prominently promotes an energetic, rhythmic walking experience with strong elements of intensity and structure."
