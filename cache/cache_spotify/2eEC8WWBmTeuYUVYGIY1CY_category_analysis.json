  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist title 'Yoga Instrumental Music 2025 | Chill Soft Vibes' and description strongly indicate its primary use for yoga, particularly Vinyasa and Flow as mentioned, with modern instrumental music suited to these practices. The high number of tracks with ambient and calm electronic properties further suggests this suitability for yoga, leading to a full confidence score for the Yoga category and assigning a score of 1.0. \n\nThe playlist also mentions it's suitable for 'walking,' a moderate to brisk workout, in contexts like relaxing or study, hence considering the mention of 'chill walking playlist' as a query. This suggests mild suitability for walking that may cater to a more relaxed or recovery-focused experience. Thus, Walking is assigned with a score of 0.7 based on moderate confidence. \n\nOther categories such as Treadmill or Running don't seem applicable given the playlist's emphasis on relaxation and ambient tones, which are less compatible with more intense running or treadmill workouts."
