  "vibesExplanation": "The 'DAVID GOGGINS RUNNING MUSIC' playlist strongly aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe due to its high-energy, motivational tracks from artists like Meek Mill, Nipsey Hussle, and Eminem, designed to evoke strength and tenacity. The emphasis on intense beats (e.g., 'Ima Boss' at 158 BPM) and powerful, triumphant themes across the 130 tracks encourages a push to limits typical of challenging treadmill runs or outdoor efforts. The playlist's association with David Goggins, known for his extreme endurance and mental fortitude, reinforces this classification. 'The Adrenaline Rush' is a secondary vibe, supported by the intense rhymes and dynamic pacing found in tracks like 'Grinding All My Life' and 'Uproar.' The playlist's intention to inspire sustained energy and emotional intensity during long runs is evident throughout, yielding high confidence in this classification. Other vibes such as 'The Speed & Power Sprint' and 'The Endorphin Wave' were considered but deemed less applicable due to the focus on endurance and motivation over speed or feel-good themes."
