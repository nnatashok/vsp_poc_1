  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'Running Motivation 2025' explicitly focuses on running, as indicated by its name and description: 'Run better, run faster.' These phrases strongly suggest a playlist designed to support running workouts through motivational and high-energy music. Additionally, the search query 'running inspiration playlist' reinforces this focus, signaling the playlist's alignment with running activities.\n\nThe playlist's high-energy tracks, such as 'Seven Nation Army' and 'Prada,' with their fast tempos (e.g., 126 and 142 bpm) and energetic EDM genre, are conducive to maintaining a fast running pace, supporting sustained physical exertion, and enhancing motivation, making the 'Running' category highly relevant with a score of 0.9.\n\n'Treadmill' also emerges as a relevant category given that treadmill workouts often benefit from similar high-energy, motivating music. The implicit connection between running, both outdoor and treadmill-based, supports this secondary classification, albeit with slightly less certainty, resulting in a score of 0.7. The absence of explicit mentions for walking or lower-intensity workouts justifies excluding those categories."
