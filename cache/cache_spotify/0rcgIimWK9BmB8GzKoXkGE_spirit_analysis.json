  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Classic Rock Running Workout Playlist' predominantly supports a High-Energy & Intense spirit due to the selection of iconic rock and hard rock tracks known for high energy levels, such as 'Back In Black', 'Crazy Train', and 'Highway to Hell'. These tracks offer driving guitar riffs, intense instrumentals, and passionate vocals, making them suitable for running sessions that aim to boost adrenaline and maintain a high pace. The inclusion of well-known anthems like 'Born to Run' by Bruce Springsteen further supports this classification, despite the mixed valence and key signatures, by providing motivational and uplifting narratives.\n\nAdditionally, the consistent beat and rhythmic flow across the playlist, mainly seen in tracks like 'Born to Run', suggests elements of Flow & Rhythm. This quality encourages synchronization of stride and beat, facilitating a trance-like focused running experience. However, the prominence of the energetic output takes precedence over rhythm, which is why the spirit score for Flow & Rhythm is slightly lower.\n\nOutdoor & Adventure has a minor presence due to thematic elements associated with escape and freedom found in tracks like 'Born to Run', making them suitable for exploratory runs. Overall, the playlist heavily favors high-energy characteristics ideal for vigorous running."
