  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist is titled 'walking in an empty street' and is described as having 'chiller songs', which suggests a laid-back vibe suitable for walking rather than running or high-intensity exercise. The metadata further supports this categorization: the playlist was queried under 'chill walking playlist', explicitly connecting it to walking. The tracks mainly by Billie Eilish, with emotional and introspective themes, along with Joe Hisaishi's 'One Summer Day', have moderate tempos and energy levels, aligning well with a relaxed walking pace. These details strongly suggest it's intended for a walking workout, though the chiller nature indicates it's not highly intense or structured, reflecting mild intensity walking activities. Keywords in descriptions, such as 'chill' and 'walking', reinforce this classification, with sufficient evidence to confidently assign this playlist primarily to the Walking category, and no strong evidence pointing towards running or treadmill workouts."
