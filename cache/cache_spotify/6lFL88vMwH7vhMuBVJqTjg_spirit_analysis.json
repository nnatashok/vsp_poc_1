  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'going on a walk :)' is designed for an energetic walking experience, emphasizing enjoying a sunny day. The description \u2018when it\u2019s sunny outside and you\u2019re just in a good mood!!\u2019 along with an 'energetic walking' query implies a spirit that enhances the enjoyment of outdoor walking. The upbeat nature of many tracks, such as SZA's 'The Weekend - Funk Wav Remix' with its high danceability and Rex Orange County's songs, support a steady, rhythmic walk by syncing footfalls with the beat, which aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. Additionally, the playlist evokes 'Outdoor & Adventure' due to its connection to mood-enhancing outdoor experiences, supported by the diverse and upbeat musical selection. The presence of fast-paced, high-energy songs like 'Electric Love' suggests a mild influence of 'High-Energy & Intense,' albeit less so as it supports walking rather than intense running. Alternative spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' don't fit due to the playlist's overall vibrant and invigorating tone."
