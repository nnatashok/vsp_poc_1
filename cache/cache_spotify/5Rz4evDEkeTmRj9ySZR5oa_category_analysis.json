  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'Epic Music for Running' is clearly intended for running activities, as strongly indicated by the playlist name and description. The title explicitly includes the term 'Running,' and the description mentions 'running inspiration, motivation,' as well as training for various types of runs, such as a full or half-marathon. These elements substantiate its primary categorization under Running with a high confidence score of 0.95. \n\nThe playlist's high-energy, instrumental tracks from genres such as epic hybrid action metal and orchestral music align well with long, outdoor or treadmill running sessions, which demand motivational and uplifting music. The metadata lacks precise contextual indicators for Walking workouts as the descriptions emphasize adrenaline and intensity over moderate or recovery-paced movements. However, the intensity might also be suitable for intense Treadmill sessions due to its focus on motivational epic themes, thereby meriting a Treadmill classification with a slightly lower score of 0.7, due to less direct evidence."
