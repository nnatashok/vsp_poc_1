  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist, titled \"peak hallway crush playlist,\" is explicitly described as containing songs to chill with while walking through school hallways. This directly suggests that the playlist is designed for a casual or leisurely walking activity, matching the 'Walking' category perfectly. The consistent use of words like \"chill\" and the context of walking through hallways indicates a low-intensity, everyday walking pace rather than a focused fitness walk outside or on a treadmill. Given these factors, a 'Walking' category score of 0.95 is appropriate, as this playlist is clearly intended for a relaxed walking experience. Other categories, such as 'Running' or 'Treadmill', are excluded due to the absence of any references to running or a controlled treadmill environment, and the playlist's emphasis on a laid-back musical experience, which does not align with the intensity typically associated with running workouts."
