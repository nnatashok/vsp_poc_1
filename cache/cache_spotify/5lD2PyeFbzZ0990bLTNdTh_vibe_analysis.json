  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist '90s Walking Music' is characterized by its high-energy, vibrant tracks from the 1990s, featuring popular feel-good songs like 'Livin' la Vida Loca' by Ricky Martin and 'Vogue' by Madonna. These tracks are marked by upbeat tempos and high danceability, which are perfect for creating a fun and expressive walking experience. The descriptions of the tracks convey themes of joy, excitement, celebration, and empowerment, which align well with 'The Groove Session' vibe. \n\nThe playlist includes many songs with a positive sentiment and major keys, contributing to an uplifting and energetic walking session. The songs like 'Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!' and 'Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit of...)' emphasize rhythmic engagement and celebration, further supporting the idea of a 'Groove Session'. With very few elements suggesting intense or meditative states, other vibes were less applicable. Thus, 'The Groove Session' was determined to be the best fit, achieving a high score of 0.9 due to the playlist's capacity to make the walking experience lively and rhythm-focused."
