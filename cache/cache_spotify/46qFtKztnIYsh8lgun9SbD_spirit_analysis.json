  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Cozy Kpop' predominantly aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit because of its explicitly described purpose as a chill playlist meant for walking, studying, and relaxing, which are activities associated with gentle, calming, and restorative effects. This is supported by the use of the words 'chill,' 'perfect to listen to while walking,' and 'relaxing at home' in the description, reinforcing a focus on relaxation and light activity. Many tracks in the playlist, such as 'Bookmark' by Lovelyz and 'Hug' by BOL4, have medium energy and danceability, suggesting a leisurely, unhurried pace suitable for restorative activities.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit also fits this playlist with a lower score due to the steady tempos and medium danceability of tracks like 'N.Flying's Spring Memories.' These elements provide a rhythmic backdrop conducive to syncing one's stride or movement with the music, promoting a continuous, easy flow typical in walking routines.\n\nThe playlist does not match 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Structured & Disciplined,' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits as it lacks high energy, structured interventions, or thematic associations with exploration or environmental connection."
