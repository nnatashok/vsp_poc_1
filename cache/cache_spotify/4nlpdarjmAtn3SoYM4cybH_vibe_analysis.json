  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist 'walking in an empty street' with a description of 'chiller songs' and a query for 'chill walking playlist' suggests a relaxed, reflective atmosphere suitable for walking. Most tracks by Billie Eilish and other artists like Sufjan Stevens and Cigarettes After Sex emphasize mellow, introspective, and soothing themes, contributing to a calm walking experience. This supports 'The Mindful Walk' vibe, aiming for immersive and reflective sessions. The moderate-low energy, introspective lyrics, and soft tones across the tracklist also align well with 'The Deep Recharge,' which focuses on relaxation and slow movement. Despite some variability in energy due to tracks like 'Die With A Smile,' the overall vibe remains consistent towards chill and introspective, indicating a less energetic but reflective walk. 'The Reboot Workout' scores lower as the playlist has slightly more energy than typical recovery sessions. The confidence level is high due to the consistent chilling and reflective nature of the songs, evident from the descriptions and metadata analysis."
