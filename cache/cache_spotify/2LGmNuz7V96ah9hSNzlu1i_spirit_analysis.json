  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'RUNNER GIRL JAMS\ud83d\udc5f\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udd25' is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a high confidence of 0.9 due to several indicators: the playlist's name and emojis (\ud83d\udc5f\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udd25) suggest an energetic and vigorous running vibe, ideal for driving maximum physical output. Many tracks, such as 'Pursuit Of Happiness - Extended Steve Aoki Remix,' 'RATATA' by Skrillex, and 'All Of The Lights' by Kanye West, are described as high energy, featuring fast tempos and intense, engaging beats, aligning perfectly with this spirit. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' receives a score of 0.6 due to the presence of upbeat and rhythmic tracks like 'Punching In A Dream' by The Naked And Famous and 'CAN'T STOP THE FEELING!' by Justin Timberlake, which are designed to keep a continuous, smooth motion suitable for a meditative running experience.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is moderately present with a score of 0.5, as the consistent beat across the playlist and prominent strong tempos in EDM and pop tracks supports maintaining a steady pace, which fits well with structured training needs. This classification is further reinforced by a mix of explicit rhythm management in songs such as 'Run Away With Me' by Carly Rae Jepsen and 'Can't Hold Us' by Macklemore."
