  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Summer Sounds' strongly suggests an 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit with a score of 0.8. The name and description emphasize summer activities such as walking on a boardwalk, chilling on a beach, and partying on a boat, all of which imply an exploration of outdoor environments. Additionally, tracks like 'Take A Walk' by Passion Pit contribute to this outdoorsy and adventurous vibe. The second spirit identified is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.7. The description mentions summer 'vibes' and 'chill walking playlist,' indicating a focus on steady, smooth motion supported by rhythmic soundtracks. Many tracks have medium to high danceability, which facilitates synchronized, continuous movement, typical of the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The inclusion of diverse genres like indie rock, pop rock, and alternative rock contributes to both the exploratory and rhythmic qualities of the playlist. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' were less applicable due to the playlist's predominant mid-tempo tracks and chill vibe."
