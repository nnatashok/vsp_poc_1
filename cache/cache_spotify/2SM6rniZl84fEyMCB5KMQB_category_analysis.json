  "categoriesExplanation": "The 'Workout Playlist 2025' is explicitly tailored for running, as indicated by the playlist name and description, which references 'Running Songs' as well as 'Workout Music', signaling its applicability to both outdoor and indoor running scenarios. The title's emphasis on 'Running Songs' is a strong indicator of its primary purpose, supporting a high score of 0.9 for the 'Running' category due to its explicit focus and intent. The inclusion of 'Gym Motivation' and 'Fitness Hits' suggests the playlist could be suitable for treadmill workouts, as the energetic and popular nature of the tracks promotes a motivated indoor workout session. Many tracks, such as 'Still D.R.E.' and 'The Nights' by Avicii, feature high energy and danceability, reinforcing their applicability for rhythm-driven exercises like treadmill running. Therefore, a score of 0.7 is assigned to the 'Treadmill' category, reflecting significant relevance but less explicit emphasis compared to outdoor running. The playlist's dynamic and motivational character, combined with high-energy tracks, reduces its alignment with walking, as the tempo and intensity are geared more towards running."
