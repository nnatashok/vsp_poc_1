  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist 'Ultimate Run Playlist' is designed to inspire high-energy running sessions, as indicated by both its title and the number of tracks (112), which suggests a lengthy run. Many tracks, such as Metro Boomin's 'Superhero' and Labrinth's contributions from the 'Euphoria' soundtrack, exhibit high BPM and intense energy, suitable for sustaining long runs and providing rhythmic pacing. This aligns well with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, which caters to energizing music that drives steady runs. Additionally, the presence of tracks with high energy and dynamic themes, reflective of transformation and empowerment, supports 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe, which is built for dynamic pacing and terrain shifts. The mix of responsible artists, known for creating layered, intense soundscapes, suggests a strong match, particularly with electronic influences, though moderate confidence is attributed due to varying lyrical emotions across individual tracks."
