  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'Walking playlist 3.0-3.5mph' explicitly suggests an energetic walking experience through its name and query. The selected tracks mainly feature medium to high energy and danceability levels, such as 'Juice' by Lizzo and 'We Are Family' by Sister Sledge, which are characterized by consistent rhythmic elements. This supports the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, as they facilitate a synchronous walking experience, scoring 0.9 for its strong representation of rhythmic walking support.\n\nFurthermore, elements of 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit are present, as some tracks evoke a sense of exploration and movement, like 'Long Train Runnin\u2019' by The Doobie Brothers with its travel metaphor, and 'I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)' by The Proclaimers. This spirit scores moderately at 0.6, suggesting an outdoor, exploratory vibe. The other spirits are less evident due to the absence of calm or intense motivational themes in the playlist's focus on rhythmic walking."
