  "spiritsExplanation": "This playlist is designed for walking and features iconic 80s tracks known for their rhythmic and energetic qualities, aligning well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. Songs like 'Sweet Dreams,' 'Maniac,' and 'Don't Stop Believin'' have consistent beats and engaging tempos, promoting a rhythmic walking pace. The steady tempos of around 120-160 bpm on several tracks like 'Maniac' and 'Sweet Dreams' facilitate a trance-like movement, making it appropriate for a flow-driven walk. The mention of energy in the query used, 'energetic walking playlist,' further supports this.\n\nThe inclusion of songs like 'Down Under' and 'Ghostbusters,' with elements of exploring identity and fun narratives, supports a secondary 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, enhancing the joy of exploring surroundings while walking.\n\nWhile the playlist is primarily meditative and steady, tracks like 'Maniac' with a high bpm and intense energy also justify a 'High-Energy & Intense' classification, albeit less prominently, as the focus is not purely on high-intensity exertion but energetic engagement.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits were not chosen as the playlist lacks structured interval cues and a relaxation focus."
