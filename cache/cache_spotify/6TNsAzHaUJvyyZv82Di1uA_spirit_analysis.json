  "spiritsExplanation": "The playlist 'running playlist to fuel my main character complex' suggests a theme of empowering and energizing music. The selection includes high-energy tracks such as 'Runaway (U & I)' by Galantis, 'My House' by Flo Rida, and 'Run the World (Girls)' by Beyonc\u00e9, which share fast tempos and intense beats, showcasing the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. This spirit is a perfect match for these dynamic and adrenaline-pumping tracks, making up the core of this playlist. The use of high-intensity music by popular high-energy artists further supports this classification. \n\nThe playlist also features tracks with consistent, rhythmic beats like 'Formation' by Beyonc\u00e9 and 'This Is What You Came For' by Calvin Harris, suggesting a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit for maintaining an ongoing, steady run. This spirit scores moderately as it aligns with the playlist's support of continuous and motivating movement. \n\nConsidering the playlist title and the use of empowerment anthems, there's a mild connection to the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, invoking thematic imagery of being a 'main character' on a personal journey or adventure. This spirit scores lower but is still present considering the emotional undertone of exploration."
