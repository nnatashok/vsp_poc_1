  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist titled 'HAPPY GIRL MORNING POWER WALK' explicitly indicates a focus on walking, as seen in the use of 'POWER WALK' in the title. The description also aligns with this theme, with the query 'energetic walking playlist' reinforcing the intent for walking activities. The tracklist further supports this categorization, featuring songs with moderate to high energy and danceability but not overly intense, making them suitable for a brisk walking pace. Many tracks have tempos in the range of 106-130 bpm, which is ideal for walking workouts. The consistent presence of pop and rock genres with upbeat and uplifting tones also complements a motivational walking session rather than more intense running or treadmill workouts. Hence, the 'Walking' category has been assigned with high confidence and a strong score due to the direct and consistent indicators throughout the metadata."
