  "categoriesExplanation": "The playlist 'Summer Sounds' lacks explicit focus on any specific workout category like running or treadmill. The description mentions 'walking on a boardwalk' as a potential activity, indicating a moderate association with walking. The music's 'chill' vibe, coupled with varied song energy from pop and rock, suggests a relaxed, moderate-paced walking playlist could be intended, which matches 'Walking' with a score of 0.75. However, due to the general summer activity theme - including non-exercise-related activities like 'chilling on a beach' or 'partying on a boat' - the playlist may not be dedicated solely to workouts, thus a secondary 'Other' category has been assigned a score of 0.25 to account for the nonspecific summer activities described. This analysis leads to a confidence level of 0.6 due to the indirect yet clear mention of walking."
