  "vibesExplanation": "The playlist 'HOT GIRL WALK 2025' aligns primarily with two secondary vibes: The Nightclub Workout and The Groove Session. The explicit focus on 'energetic walking' coupled with high-energy, danceable tracks across pop genres suggests a party-like, upbeat atmosphere, synonymous with The Nightclub Workout. This is evident from tracks like 'Espresso' by Sabrina Carpenter and 'HOT TO GO!' by Chappell Roan, which possess high energy and danceability, along with a positive, confident lyrical sentiment. The playlist's emphasis on confidence and empowerment reflects a vibe that supports freedom of movement, highlighted in songs like 'Stronger' by Britney Spears and 'Confident' by Demi Lovato, reinforcing The Groove Session vibe. These tracks contribute to a fun, expressive walking session, fitting for those looking to enjoy an empowering, socially vibrant workout. Given the consistent high energy and danceability across the tracklist, the classification has high confidence, though there's some overlap in the vibes due to their complementary nature for the playlist's use-case."
