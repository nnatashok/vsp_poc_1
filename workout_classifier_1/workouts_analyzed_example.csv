The description outlines an interval-based workout on an elliptical machine, including 'all-out interval work' and 'repeat 8 times,' which are hallmark features of HIIT. The channel, Sunny Health & Fitness, is known for providing workouts utilizing various fitness equipment, aligning with the use of an elliptical here. User comments further corroborate the elliptical focus, mentioning its appropriateness for users with various fitness goals.
