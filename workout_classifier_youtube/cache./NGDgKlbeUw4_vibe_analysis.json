  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled '30 MIN CARDIO PILATES || Full Body Workout (Low Impact)' on the channel 'Move With Nicole' suggests a blend of Pilates with cardio elements, indicating a potentially expressive and fluid experience. The use of 'cardio flows' in the description implies a rhythmic and dance-like quality, aligning with 'The Groove Session' vibe, as it suggests a playful yet effective workout style. The calm and guided approach, as noted by the channel's focus on Pilates and calm workouts, aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, capturing a grounding, breath-centered experience. The comments reflect an enjoyable and uplifting session, which is typical of 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse', although this is less emphasized than the other vibes. The confidence level is moderate to high at 0.7 due to the explicit mention of cardio flows and user feedback, indicating a fun, calm, and rhythmic workout."
