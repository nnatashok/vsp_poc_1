  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is only 10 minutes long with no programmed breaks, which suggests a light to moderate effort level. It's explicitly designed to be low impact and can be done multiple times a day. The phrases \"low impact\" and \"performed for one minute sequenced back to back\" indicate a simple, manageable effort. The higher viewership and comments from older or less active users further indicate the workout's accessibility for a light effort level, with some moderate efforts due to the continuous nature of the sequences.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout primarily targets individuals with high blood pressure, a common issue among beginners and deconditioned users. The metadata highlights its suitability for managing health conditions, particularly emphasizing its low impact and short duration. This aligns well with beginner fitness levels, evidenced by the comments from users with related health challenges. Despite being beginner-friendly, the lack of breaks and sequence of exercises suggest intermediate suitability for those slightly more active. While easy to start, the continuous nature without rest could add a small challenge for beginners, thus partially fitting intermediates."
