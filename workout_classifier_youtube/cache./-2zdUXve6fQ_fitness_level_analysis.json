  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a guided meditation session which does not involve physical movements or complex techniques. Meditation primarily involves sitting still and focusing on breathing or verbal guidance. The title and description emphasize mindfulness and being present, indicating simplicity. Tags such as 'guided visualization' and 'guided relaxation' further suggest that the meditation process is straightforward and requires minimal technique. This aligns perfectly with a beginner technique difficulty as it demands no physical skill or coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is a 20-minute guided meditation, characterized by calm and relaxation. The description includes terms like 'stress reduction' and 'relaxation.' Meditation is known for a very low energy expenditure as it typically involves sitting or lying down, focusing on breathing. The video's purpose is to aid in mindfulness without physical strain, highlighted by comments about peace and mental reset. Thus, it aligns with the 'Light' level for effort difficulty, suitable for a wide range of users including complete beginners.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given that both technique and effort difficulty are rated at the beginner and light levels respectively, the required fitness level derives naturally as 'Beginner.' The simplicity of engagement (sitting quietly) and the emphasis on mental presence rather than physical exertion ensures that even those completely new to mindfulness practices can participate comfortably. Additionally, as meditation does not require physical fitness but rather mental engagement, it perfectly fits for those at a beginner fitness level."
