  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is most accurately classified under 'Stretching,' as indicated by the repeated emphasis on stretches both in the title and description. The phrase 'BEGINNER FLOOR STRETCHES' in the title, coupled with descriptions about flexibility and relaxation, strongly suggest that stretching is the primary focus, hence the high score of 0.9.\n\n'Yoga' also emerges as a relevant category due to the numerous tags that contain the term 'yoga' such as 'morning yoga routine,' 'quick yoga,' and 'yoga for flexibility.' The tags and discussion of relaxation and stress reduction in the description imply a yoga element, but since these are not explicitly highlighted in the title or description, the score is slightly lower at 0.7.\n\n'Mat' is another relevant category due to the indication that all exercises are performed 'on the floor today, so grab your mat,' suggesting that the workout involves mat-based exercises. This justifies a score of 0.6, as this aspect is present but not the main focus. \n\nOther potential categories such as 'Body weight' and 'Meditation' are not supported by the metadata, which lacks references to strength training or mindfulness exercises."
