  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.95. This classification is supported by several explicit elements in the metadata. The title 'Boost Recovery with Full Body Stretch Yoga for Athletes' emphasizes the recovery and restorative nature of the session. The description further reinforces this by mentioning it as a 'yoga class for athletes to boost recovery.' Tags like 'yoga for recovery' and comments noting the relaxing and rejuvenating effects, such as one participant stating they felt relaxed and even fell asleep after the session, underscore this classification.\n\nThe secondary spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.6 is indicated through the channel's focus on yoga and the use of terms like 'fluidity of a strong practice' in the channel's about section, suggesting a flow-based approach to yoga.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is present but to a lesser extent with a score of 0.4. This is inferred from the systematic approach to educating beginners as stated in the description and supported by the credentials of the instructors.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' are excluded due to the session's focus on recovery and relaxation rather than intensity or high energy efforts."
