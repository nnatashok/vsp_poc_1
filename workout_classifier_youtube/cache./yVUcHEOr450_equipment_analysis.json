  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video explicitly states 'No Equipment' in both the title and description, suggesting that the workout is designed to be performed using only bodyweight exercises. Tags such as 'no equipment' and 'workout at home' further emphasize the accessibility and equipment-free nature of the routine. Additionally, the top comments and tags align with the theme of an accessible, equipment-free HIIT workout, aimed at calorie burning and fat loss. Therefore, it seems the workout does not require any additional equipment for participants."
