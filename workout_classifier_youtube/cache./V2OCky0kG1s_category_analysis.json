  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is titled \"10 Minute Cardio Workout at Home\" and explicitly noted as a low-impact cardio workout for beginners. The presence of tags like \"10 minute cardio workout at home,\" \"low impact cardio workout for beginners,\" and \"walking exercise for weight loss\" suggest that the workout could involve movements typically done on a mat or without specific equipment, such as dance-like cardio or low-intensity aerobics. Therefore, 'Mat' is assigned a score of 0.7 as it aligns well with the 'no equipment needed' aspect of the workout. Furthermore, the tag 'indoor walking for weight loss' suggests elements of walking movements, earning a score of 0.4 under 'Walking'. Most of the activities described fit an at-home cardio session focusing on low-impact exercise, thus supporting these category choices. The confidence is fairly high due to explicit mentions of low-impact cardio, though precise exercises aren't detailed."
