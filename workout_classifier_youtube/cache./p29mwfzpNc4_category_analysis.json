  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Meditation' with a score of 1.0, reflecting very high confidence. The title and description explicitly use terms like 'guided meditation,' 'mindfulness,' 'calming,' and 'meditative journey,' which strongly indicate a meditation session. Additionally, the focus on mental relaxation, mindfulness, and healing in the tags reinforces the meditation classification. The channel description also highlights guided meditations as a core content area.\n\nI assigned the 'Breathing exercises' category a score of 0.2, acknowledging a minor element of breath control typically involved in meditation practices, although not explicitly mentioned. The absence of explicit references to breathing techniques or exercises in the metadata limits the confidence and score for this category.\n\nOther potential categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' are excluded because there is no mention of physical postures, despite the channel\u2019s general yoga focus. The video's emphasis on emotional and mental healing further distinguishes it as a meditation rather than a physical yoga practice."
