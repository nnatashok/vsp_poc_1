  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Meditation' with a score of 1.0, as the video title and metadata indicate a strong focus on guided meditation. The use of terms like \"guided meditation,\" \"clearing blockages,\" and \"negativity\" in the title, tags, and description, and the channel's exclusive focus on meditation content, support this classification. The comments also reflect a user's experience consistent with meditation, such as feeling at ease and seeking peace. \n\nThe secondary category 'Breathing exercises' is assigned a score of 0.5. Meditation often includes controlled breathing elements, although the video doesn't explicitly mention it. The presence of themes like finding calmness and balance through internal reflection suggests a mild presence of breathing components, which are often implicit in meditation practices. There is little to no mention of specific physical exercises, excluding categories like Yoga or Stretching, which requires more explicit movement focus."
