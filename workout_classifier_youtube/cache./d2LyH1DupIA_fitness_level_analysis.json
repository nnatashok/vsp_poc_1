  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty of this workout is assessed as primarily Beginner. The movements involved in using an elliptical machine are very straightforward, requiring minimal coordination or complex technique. This is reinforced by the video's title and description explicitly stating it is for beginners. The inclusion of interval training could introduce a slight increase in complexity, hence the Intermediate score, but overall, the exercise on an elliptical is simple and accessible to beginners.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves interval training on an elliptical over 20 minutes, which is moderately physically demanding. The intervals alternate between adding resistance and pace changes, requiring a sustained effort but not to an extreme level. The 20-minute duration and the described intervals would be somewhat challenging for deconditioned users due to the alternating resistance and pace, lending a stronger alignment with Moderate effort. However, it is not as intense as a HIIT workout, so it retains some attributes of Light effort, particularly during no-resistance phases.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is assessed as primarily Beginner with a strong allowance for Intermediate. The workout is labeled as a '20 Minute Elliptical Interval Workout for Beginners,' supporting that it is intended for a beginner audience. However, the integration of interval training and resistance changes could pose some challenge, justifying a solid Intermediate score. Since it is over 20 minutes, it is more demanding than typical beginner workouts, which results in a lower Advanced score as well due to the potential sustained effort required for even basic intervals."
