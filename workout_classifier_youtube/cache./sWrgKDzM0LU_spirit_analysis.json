  "spiritsExplanation": "The title \"Guided Mindfulness Meditation for the Morning: Starting the Day\" and the description emphasize relaxation, mindfulness, and a positive start to the day, which align with the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The use of terms like \"meditation,\" \"peace,\" \"calm,\" \"relax,\" and \"mindful\" in the tags further supports this classification, indicating a session focused on stress reduction and inner peace. The channel, MindfulPeace, with content described as promoting \"mindfulness and inner peace,\" consistently creates videos with a similar restorative spirit. Comments from users highlight themes of calm, inner peace, and emotional release, which are core aspects of the Soothing & Restorative spirit. Given the lack of indicators for high intensity, structure, flow, or outdoor elements, other spirits were ruled out. The combination of these aspects provides very high confidence in assigning a Soothing & Restorative spirit with a score of 0.95, as it perfectly embodies the calming and healing energy intended by the video."
