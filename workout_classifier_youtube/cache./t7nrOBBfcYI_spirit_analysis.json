  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'Flow & Rhythm' primarily due to its focus on being a 'fun workout your whole family can do together,' as stated in the title and description. This suggests an emphasis on enjoyment and smooth, coordinated movement rather than technical precision or intense energy. The use of terms like 'family' and 'fun' indicates a rhythmic, engaging style that is designed to be inclusive and easy-going, fitting the characteristics of Flow & Rhythm. A score of 0.65 denotes a strong match as the workout seems to prioritize enjoyment and music-driven pacing.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is considered with a lower score of 0.4. The workout duration of 13 minutes and the cardio emphasis suggest some level of intensity, but the word 'fun' moderates this intensity, indicating it may not push participants to their absolute limits. Hence, while there are elements of quick, energetic movement as per cardio workouts, the main focus appears to be more on accessible and enjoyable activity rather than intensity.\n\nOverall, there is high confidence (0.7) in these spirits due to clear indicators in the title and description."
