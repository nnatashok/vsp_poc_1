  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout combines Pilates and yoga, which incorporates movements that range from simple to moderately complex. Tags like 'yoga pilates full body workout' and descriptors such as 'Stretch & Strengthen' suggest a blend of flexibility and core-focused exercises. Such exercises typically require some coordination and balance, placing the workout at an intermediate technique difficulty. However, given the fusion style, there may be some beginner-level movements. References to 'full body stretch' also indicate basic stretching, supporting beginner and intermediate ratings. The advanced rating is due to the potential inclusion of more challenging yoga or Pilates sequences.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 39 minutes, which places it near the limit where effort difficulty starts challenging less fit users. Descriptions such as 'feel both strong and relaxed' along with user comments praising the challenging nature suggest a moderate to challenging effort level. The 'yoga pilates fusion' style likely involves continuous movement, which can increase cardiovascular output and exertion, hence the challenging score.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the intermediate technique difficulty and moderate to challenging effort difficulty, the required fitness level aligns more with intermediate users. This level would typically accommodate individuals familiar with some basic movement patterns and yoga/pilates principles. The advanced score accounts for the potential complexity and duration that could be demanding for beginners. The workout is not suitable for complete beginners due to its length and potential movement complexity."
