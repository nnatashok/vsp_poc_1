  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit assigned is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a high confidence score of 0.85. This is based on the title '15 Min Daily Yoga Flow' and the description mentioning 'full body yoga routine' and 'vinyasa flow,' which emphasize continuous movement and coordination. The description highlights a sequence for different levels, aligning with smooth and adaptable movement patterns. The channel's focus on yoga and Charlie's expertise in \"vinyasa yoga\" and \"intelligent approach to sequencing\" further supports this classification.\n\n'Soothing & Restorative' is the secondary spirit, scored at 0.7. The workout's inclusion of personalized options for different levels implies a gentle, adaptable practice. Comments about easing pain and stress, feeling set to start the day, and providing relief support a restorative and calming effect indicative of this spirit. The emphasis on daily practice suggests a routine for ongoing mental and physical well-being, aligning with the notion of soothing and restorative workouts.\n\nOther spirits were considered, but the lack of explicit references to high intensity, sports-related elements, or outdoor scenarios excluded them as primary classifications."
