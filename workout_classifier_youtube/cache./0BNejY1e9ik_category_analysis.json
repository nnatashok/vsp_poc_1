  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Breathing exercises' with a high score of 0.95. This classification is supported by the prominence of 'breathing' in the title, hashtags, and description of the video. Phrases like 'guided breathing for beginners' and 'breathing exercises' explicitly reference structured breath control practices. The emphasis on breath holds and the detailed guidance on breathing technique aligns strongly with this category. \n\nA secondary category, 'Meditation', is assigned with a score of 0.4. This is due to elements that suggest a meditative component, such as the audiovisual guide to help maintain rhythm and the immersive experience that tunes out surroundings for focusing on breath. However, explicit meditation practices like mindfulness or concentration techniques are less emphasized, hence the lower score.\n\nThe low presence of other physical activities excluded categories like 'Body weight', 'Yoga', etc., as the video's focus does not involve such exercises."
