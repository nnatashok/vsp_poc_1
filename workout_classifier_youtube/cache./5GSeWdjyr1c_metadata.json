    "Zen and meditation helped me walk away from the brink of suicide and this was one of the first videos I watched on my journey.",
    "10 years ago I had never meditated in my life..... I watched this video and felt something so profound and real. Something I\u2019d never experienced. Since that day, I\u2019ve meditated for atleast 15 minutes a day. Looking back on it, this one simple YouTube video was the tiny spark that went on to change who I am and my destiny completely, I can\u2019t thank you enough for this video.",
    "I noticed how many people here had suicidal thoughts. I&#39;m one of them. My wife 34 past away from covid 20 March 2021 due to asthma and I survived it. I&#39;m battling without her and miss her so much. I want to meditate to stay in contact with her. She is my everything and wait for me when my time comes. I wish everyone a blessed life filled with peace and happiness.",
    "He talks to you like you\u2019re a child. And I think it really works. Because the one that fears inside us is really a child who\u2019s afraid of what he doesn\u2019t understand clearly. You need to be calm to be clear. I wish you guys all the best.. we are survivors.",
    "I didnt want to open my eyes when he said to, i was in deep space, when i did my room truly seemed different. That was awesome!"
