  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily categorized as a 'Breathing exercises' video with a perfect score of 1. This is strongly supported by explicit mentions of 'box breathing', 'breathing meditation', 'breathwork', and 'breathing exercises' in the tags and description. Additionally, the channel 'TAKE A DEEP BREATH' focuses on breathwork and breathing exercises, as described in the channel information. \n\nThe second category, 'Meditation', is assigned a score of 0.7. This is due to the focus on 'mindfulness meditation' and 'guided meditation' as seen in the tags and video description, indicating a meditation aspect through the practice of focused breathing for relaxation and mind-body connection.\n\nThe 'Yoga' category is included with a score of 0.4 because, while not as direct, the practice of pranayama (controlled breathing) is a key component of traditional yoga practices. The description and tags mention 'pranayama', linking the exercise loosely to yoga.\n\nOther potential categories like 'Stretching', 'Body weight', and various cardio forms were excluded as there was no mention of physical exercise involving movement or strength training."
