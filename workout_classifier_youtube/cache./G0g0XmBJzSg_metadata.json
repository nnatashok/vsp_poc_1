    "Okay I&#39;ll be honest I started to watch calisthenics family videos from last 5 months and staring there was no development but as time pass I started to notice change in body  strength and  shape and balance now I&#39;m using calisthenics family app  and it&#39;s best for beginners like me",
    "Super follow along FB calesthenics workout. I am now 63 years old and have been using your training app and follow along Youtube videos since about 2020 and my body has changed alot. I am leaner ,more defined, and stronger in many exercises. I still enjoy doing basic exercises and more difficult variations/progressions along with  isometric exercises. I am doing more mobility and flexibility work also thanks to you guys.Realistically i will not be doing street / free style calesthenics workouts and that is ok.  Calesthenics is for everyone, for ever and for longevity. I started training also with rings which is a total game changer.I cannot wait for more of your videos.Thank you guys for your training expertise and encouragement.",
    "Great way to get started with bodyweight exercises. Short, simple, and effective \u2013 I can definitely feel it working! Thanks for making fitness accessible for everyone!",
    "Just started a week ago with the pro and combining the &#39;without materials&#39; with &#39;weight loss&#39; and cardio running. You guys really help the beginners to get going and motivated without 4 days of muscle pain!",
