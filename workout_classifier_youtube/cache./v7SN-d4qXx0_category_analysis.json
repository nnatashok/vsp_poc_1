  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Yoga' with a score of 1.0. This is directly indicated by the title 'Bedtime Yoga | 20 Minute Bedtime Yoga Practice | Yoga With Adriene' and supported by multiple tags such as 'bedtime yoga', 'yoga for sleep', 'evening yoga', and the channel name 'Yoga With Adriene'. Yoga is explicitly mentioned as the focus of the session and channel.\n\nAdditionally, 'Meditation' is relevant with a score of 0.4 due to the mention of practices that address stress, relaxation, and introspection, as seen in phrases like 'remedy for stress, anxiety, or tension' and 'relaxing yoga'. The comments also suggest a meditative, calming effect with terms like 'let go' and improving mental health by reducing anxiety and stress.\n\n'Stretching' is considered with a score of 0.4 because the video includes elements aimed at relaxation and flexibility, indicated by tags such as 'yoga stretches' and aims to 'decompress' and 'prepare for a good night's rest'. \n\nOther categories, such as 'Pilates' or 'Mat', were not considered due to the explicit focus on yoga and relaxation, rather than strength or core-centric exercises."
