  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled 'Full Body Stretching Routine (15 min. Follow Along)' from the channel 'Strength Side' emphasizes a low-stress, flexibility-focused workout. This aligns well with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which encompasses gentle stretching and mobility work. The description highlights that the routine aims to improve flexibility, joint health, and muscle strength, which are characteristics of 'The Reboot Workout' and justify a strong score of 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, phrases such as 'opening up all the ranges of motion' and 'no equipment or gym needed' suggest a relaxed, breath-centered flow, characteristics of 'The Zen Flow,' meriting a score of 0.7. \n\nLastly, the focus on joint health and body maintenance suggests 'The Foundation Builder' vibe, as it strengthens weak points and perfects basics, which the metadata supports with tags like 'stretching exercises for beginners' and mentions of strengthening ranges of motion. This justifies a moderate score of 0.6 for 'The Foundation Builder.'\n\nThe choice of vibes is influenced by the video's emphasis on gentle, intentional movement for a wide audience, including beginners and older adults, as evidenced by user comments. No high-intensity or complex skill-building is indicated, therefore excluding other vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Masterclass Workout.'"
