  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes compound moves like squat to shoulder press and single-leg kickstand Romanian deadlift with row, which require moderate coordination and stability, fitting the Intermediate level. However, the inclusion of combination movements and complex exercises such as single-leg RDLs push the boundary towards Advanced technique difficulty, especially for users unfamiliar with full-body workouts.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 32 minutes long, involving rounds with a 50/20 work/rest ratio, which introduces sustained effort and raises the intensity. The structure with multi-exercise rounds and a moderate rest period aligns with Moderate effort difficulty, but the heavy lifting focus and reduced rest periods lean towards Challenging, particularly for deconditioned users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "While the workout utilizes adjustable dumbbells allowing for modification, the combination of technique and sustained effort points strongly towards Intermediate fitness level, especially considering the 32-minute duration and compound exercises. The provision of modifications (e.g., lunges) allows some beginners to attempt it, but the stronger alignment is with Intermediate and Advanced due to the complexity and intensity required."
