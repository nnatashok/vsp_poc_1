  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The primary exercise in the video is a squat, which is a fundamental lower body exercise. Squats are categorized as a Beginner level technique due to their straightforward nature, where basic form can be maintained with minimal guidance. However, given that the video mentions following along with Jordan Yeoh, there might be some variations or a faster pace that could introduce slight complexity, suggesting a very mild relevance to Intermediate level technique, reflected in the score of 0.3.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of 100 squats which can be quite demanding, especially if done consecutively. The video's duration is relatively short at 8:51 minutes, suggesting a quick tempo, which elevates effort difficulty. The description encourages alternative exercises if the pace is challenging, implying a base-level accessibility but with room for increased effort, hence a Moderate classification with some alignment to Challenging difficulty due to potential intensity and pace.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique is mainly Beginner with a minor Intermediate aspect due to potential pace and variations. The effort difficulty being Moderate with a potential to challenge beginners indicates that even users new to exercise can aim to complete this workout with some adjustments or breaks, explaining the Beginner level fit. However, the challenge is more aligned with Intermediate users, especially considering the intensity for those less conditioned. Advanced users may also find it beneficial as part of a warm-up or as an accessory workout, supporting the inclusion of Advanced in the classification."
