  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is primarily classified as 'The Meditative Grind' due to its cycling theme and emphasis on endurance and repetition. Metadata mentions 'indoor cycling' and 'turbo-training', which are telltale indicators of steady, repetitive workout routines. The structure also highlights pedaling at various speeds in a pyramid format, characteristic of endurance-based training sessions. This vibe is given a score of 0.75 due to the structured, sustained effort typical of long-distance cycling or rowing sessions. \n\n'Endorphin Wave' is also suitable with a score of 0.6, supported by user comments noting elevated heart rate and a steady build of intensity. The use of engaging music further complements this vibe by creating a feel-good, energetic atmosphere.\n\nLastly, 'The Warrior Workout' with a score of 0.4 aligns because of the high-intensity training tag and the mention of a 'tough, effective training session'. The use of the phrase 'heart pumping' in the description points to high effort levels sought in warrior-type workouts, but the overall tone leans more towards endurance, thus the lower confidence."
