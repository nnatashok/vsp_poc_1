  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe assigned is 'The Foundation Builder' with a very high confidence score of 0.9. This is due to the focus on a beginner-level bodyweight routine that aims to establish a basic level of physical fitness. The description emphasizes muscle strengthening, foundation building, and progression to more advanced exercises, which strongly aligns with the idea of strengthening weak points and perfecting basics.\n\n'Comfort Moves' received a score of 0.6 due to the routine's accessibility and suitability for beginners or those returning to exercise, as reflected in user comments like 'beginner-friendly' and 'getting back into the swing.' The short duration and bodyweight nature also suggest a comfortable, non-intimidating approach.\n\n'Reboot Workout' was considered with a score of 0.4 because the routine offers a low-stress, total-body focus that can refresh and reinvigorate, supported by comments appreciating the routine's brevity and integration into daily schedules.\n\nOther vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded due to the workout's gentle, foundational approach rather than intense or explosive characteristics."
