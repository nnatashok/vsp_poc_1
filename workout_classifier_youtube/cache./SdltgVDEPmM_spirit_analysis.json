  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata indicates that the primary focus of this workout video is to achieve front splits through a structured and repetitive stretch routine, which aligns with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. Evidence supporting this includes phrases such as 'flexibility routine,' 'beginners guide to getting your splits,' and 'including into your daily life,' suggesting a methodical approach. The emphasis on progressive improvement over time, mentioned in both the description and comments, reinforces this classification. This is scored at 0.7 for its clear structure and goal-oriented nature.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant as the video is a stretching session, which often has soothing and recovery-focused elements. User comments reflect a journey towards flexibility and stress relief, which align with the nature of restorative activities. However, as the primary focus is flexibility rather than relaxation, this is given a slightly lower score of 0.6. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are not applicable due to the calming and indoor nature of stretching exercises."
