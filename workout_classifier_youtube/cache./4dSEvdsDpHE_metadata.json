    "Calisthenics has been calling me for years now and today is the day for me to start . I am 60 years old and out of shape and ready to transform .<br>I\u2019ve watched many videos on the subject and Summer you are the one I resonate the most with and want to learn from .<br>You are an excellent teacher and very inspiring .<br>This video is perfect .<br>Thank You for sharing and for being You .",
    "Calisthenics is a thing of progression. You cannot start doing anything HARD right away, because your body cannot respond to the demands that it takes to do the really advanced things. It&#39;s all progression,  little by little daily and constant training. You have to give your body time to adjust to this. It takes years to condition your body, like a dancer or a contortionist etc., You cannot do anything in one day or a few months. Also exercise is a discipline for life, not something you do for a little while, it&#39;s forever. One day at a time!",
    "I love that somebody like me that doesn&#39;t have any skills you&#39;re starting me with basic things that I can actually do everybody starts with just one step I really appreciate you doing these some basic simple stuff that I can build on and I can practice and even though I have all this extra weight on me I can work on doing basics and building on it thank you so much",
    "I think you are absolutely right! This is sucha great beginner workout and people would be so smart to start here instead of diving right in to more challenging workouts when their bodies have not been conditioned for that yet. Love it. Keep up the good work!"
