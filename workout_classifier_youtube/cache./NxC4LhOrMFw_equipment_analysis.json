  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video 'Yoga For Hands, Fingers, Wrists | 11-Minute Yoga Quickie' primarily focuses on therapeutic exercises targeting the wrists, hands, fingers, and forearms to relieve stress and improve range of motion. The description and tags emphasize exercises for carpal tunnel syndrome and wrist pain, suggesting a gentle, yoga-based routine.\n\nThere's no explicit mention of any equipment in the title, description, tags, or comments. Instead, the video encourages users to engage in self-care through a short, therapeutic session, indicating a likely reliance on bodyweight or natural movement exercises typical in yoga classes. Common equipment for yoga such as mats are not mentioned, likely because the focus is on upper body mobility exercises that can be performed in any comfortable seated or standing position. Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that no specific equipment is required for this session, thus leading to a classification of bodyweight-only exercises."
