  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves cycling with high-intensity interval structures (tabata), requiring some coordination to manage speed and resistance. While cycling is relatively straightforward, properly executing intervals with correct resistance settings involves intermediate technical skill. The mention of specific RPMs and resistance settings, such as climbing, suggests a degree of nuance beyond basic cycling. Though not overly complex, these elements place the technique slightly higher than beginner level, hence the combination of Intermediate and Advanced scores.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is highly physically demanding due to its tabata structure, requiring intense effort during 20-second sprints with only 10-second rest periods. The use of phrases like 'give it your 100%' and 'leave you feeling ALIVE' indicate significant energy expenditure. Although it's only 5 minutes long, the continuous high-intensity nature and inclusion of sprints and heavy climbs contribute to a Challenging level. Extreme is less emphasized due to the short workout duration, but considered due to the intensity of intervals.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.7,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Derived from a moderate technique difficulty and challenging effort, this workout appeals to multiple fitness levels. The 'beginner' score is due to the workout's short duration and option to adjust RPMs for comfort, making it accessible for motivated beginners. 'Intermediate' and 'Advanced' levels are emphasized more strongly due to the intensity of tabata cycling and the requirement to control resistance effectively. Multiple comments suggest users of varying fitness levels engage with this workout; thus, a broad fitness level classification is applied."
