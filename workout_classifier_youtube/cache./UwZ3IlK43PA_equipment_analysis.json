  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"Kids 'GET STRONG' Full Body Strength Training Workout\" indicates it is a workout designed for kids, focusing on building strength. However, the metadata lacks any explicit mention or implication of required equipment. The title and description emphasize kids' strength training, but there are no references to any specific equipment types, such as dumbbells or resistance bands, which are commonly used in strength training exercises. The tags focus on generic workout and exercise terms for kids, suggesting a bodyweight-focused workout without the need for additional gear. This conclusion is further supported by the typical format of children's workouts, which often rely on simple, equipment-free exercises to ensure accessibility and safety. Therefore, I conclude that the workout appears to be bodyweight only."
