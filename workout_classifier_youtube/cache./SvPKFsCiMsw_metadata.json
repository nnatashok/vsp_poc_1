This yoga for stiff bodies class is perfect to do every morning or anytime you need a bit of movement. You can even use this practice as a warm up before a longer yoga class or right before or after your workout or run. Join me in this quick 10 minute morning yoga full body stretch to feel your best!\n\n#Yoga #10MinuteYoga #YogaWithBird\n\nThe Katia Bodysuit  i am wearing is gifted to me by Babelicious Wear which i am absolutely in love with! As you may know i hate wearing alot of clothing to practice yoga in because wearing less is less restricting and freeing for me personally. Babelicious body suits truly feel like a second skin and allows you to focus on the practice rather than pulling and tugging on your leggings.\n\nYou are able to purchase your own now through to December 10th and after that you may sign up to be on the wait list.\n\nWebsite: https://www.babeliciouswear.com/\nWaitlist: https://lnk.bio/babeliciouswear\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/babeliciouswear/\n#badassZenBabes\n\n & support.\n\n________________________________________\n\nJoin Yoga With Bird's Email List: https://mailchi.mp/34e952e0ed28/yoga-with-bird-email-list\n\nIMPORTANT LINKS: https://linktr.ee/yogawithbird\n\nYoga Essentials:\nYoga Mat: https://amzn.to/31wXrLM\nYoga Blocks (Cork): https://amzn.to/3inS083\nYoga Blocks (Foam): https://amzn.to/3ngkJ2e\nYoga Strap: https://amzn.to/36tk8nW\nPranamat: https://amzn.to/31z0aEj\nYogaWheel: https://amzn.to/3ilXrEx\n\nVisit My Amazon Store For All My Must Haves!:\n\n\nMusic: https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/qnrd89/\n\nJoin Honey to SAVE money while shopping online: https://www.joinhoney.com/ref/45p0vps\n\nNOTE: Some links may be affiliate links that Yoga With Bird earns a small percentage of however each affiliate product is something she genuinely loves and has used herself.\n\n________________________________________\n\nYOGA CHALLENGES:\n\n30 Day Flexibility Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlybJmrSb19MiVWnve5slKTJ\n\n30 Day Restorative Yoga Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlwr-X3VF2CrZdf7rDrWH1aB\n\n7 Day Yoga For Overall Health: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlyTB8gu7I99XQkw9M85YdTk\n\n5 Day Morning Yoga Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlyjr87XsR6j4QGzyKKxwsTH\n\n5 Day Hip Flexibility Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlwAnZvLflZM-e5WWedHTBpo\n\n________________________________________\n\nABOUT THIS YOUTUBE YOGA CHANNEL\n\nFrancine Cipollone also known as her childhood nickname Bird is a 200hr Certified Yoga Teacher who found a passion for helping others find inner peace, self love and happiness through the practice of Yoga & Meditation.

    "One thing I appreciate is your moments of quiet. Lots of other yoga leaders talk about calm, but they talk so much that it&#39;s hard to find it.",
    "As a 20-something who has a full systemic autoimmune disease and history of ovarian cancer my body is STIFF all the time! This has helped so much. I even got my fiancee to start doing this with me and it&#39;s been so helpful for the both of us. Thank you so much!",
    "Does anyone else feel an emotional release during this practice? This brought on such a feeling of gratitude and love for my body, it made me cry \ud83d\ude05 Thank you for the peaceful and uplifting video, it was just what I needed today",
    "Before i did this, i felt like a slug, i could not get out of bed and my legs and head were KILLING ME so i thought to my self, &quot;maybe if i do a 10 minute yoga session i will feel a bit better?&quot; So i searched up &quot;yoga 10 minutes, and this was the first thing that popped up, i decided to try it, and within half of it, I felt SO much better my legs almost completely stopped hurting and i felt less overwhelmed and i felt like i was back to my normal self again. Thank you."
