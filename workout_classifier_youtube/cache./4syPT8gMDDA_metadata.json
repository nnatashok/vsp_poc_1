    "I have just woken up after my first night of uninterrupted sleep. For the past 2 months I have suffered with pelvic floor pain- triggered by grieve ,emotional trauma and a hypotonic pelvic floor. I&#39;ve been so miserable and down. I have committed to this video and the pain has finally gone! With no help from a Pelvic specialist- thank you so much for putting this content out. The good you are doing for people is immense. Massive huge hug from me. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\u2764",
    "Tears rolled down my cheeks at some moments with this exercise. I guess I have much emotional pain buried in my pelvic floor. I&#39;ll keep working on it. Thank you, your voice is angelical.",
    "This is amazing. I really feel the warmth and expansion in my pelvic floor. And I teared up at the end when you said, &quot;You&#39;re doing your best and it is absolutely enough. You&#39;re going to be okay.&quot; Wow. I needed that. &lt;3",
    "I cound&#39;t get my period for 3 weeks, I was really frustrated and upset, I tried many things, meditations, yoga exercising, listening to special music or pressing points on my body. But I think that your meditation along with yoga exercise helped the most, something inside of me which plugged me is gone and I finally have my period back! I cannot be happier! I also added more C vitamin and water into my diet, but I like to think that you really helped me. Thank you!"
