    "These exercises really work for me. I tend to get persistent knee pain if I run for long periods of time without adding strenght training 2-3x weekly. I took a running break to allow my knee to heal, followed this program, and reintroduced runs slowly. I now run 12km 3x weekly with no problems. If you&#39;re sick of injuries I highly recommend trying this",
    "The one thing about this guy ..is that he speaks clearly ....and explains  it well ...while explaining why specific exercises are recommended....a really good teaching video \ud83d\udc4d",
    "Clean, organized and super useful info. With a masters in PE and running competitively for almost 30 years there is still a lot to learn. Thank you."
