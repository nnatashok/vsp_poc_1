  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title and description indicate that the video is a full body stretch and mobility routine, which typically requires a mat for comfort and support during floor exercises. Although the metadata does not explicitly mention a mat, it is strongly implied due to the nature of the workout (stretching and mobility). Ingredients such as 'full body stretch', 'flexibility routine', 'mobility routine' in the tags, and using the routine as a 'warm-up or cool down' in the description also suggest exercises often performed on the floor. Therefore, a high confidence score of 0.8 is assigned to the mat being required equipment for this workout."
