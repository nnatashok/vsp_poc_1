  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "Absolutely hated working out until I found your channel, now I treat it as my little me-time. \ud83d\udc96",
    "Here is another 30 Minute Full Body Pilates Workout for you! Let me know what classes you would like to see next. I always love your suggestions! Lots of love to you all. \ud83d\udc9c",
    "This channel is my daily therapy; crazy what it&#39;s done for my mental health these past few months \u2665\ufe0f",
    "&quot;The most important thing is to keep breathing&quot; -- the fact that you had to say it multiple times in this video was noticed! Hurts so good!",
    "I must say, I LOVE your music selection in your videos! Other Pilates instructors on YouTube usually use upbeat music or no music at all, which both doesn&#39;t really work for me. But your videos are perfect, the music is relaxing but also motivating. And your gentle voice and narration is very calming, too. I am really glad, that I found you :) Love from Germany &lt;3"
