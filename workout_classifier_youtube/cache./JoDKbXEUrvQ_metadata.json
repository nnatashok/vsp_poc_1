    "I had COVID six weeks ago, and did this routine every day, on a daily basis, along with some very gentle Wim Hof breathing (building up gradually).  Though I was very short of breath at the end of quarantine, my breathing routines kept me out of serious trouble, and I was able to avoid hospitalization.  I have been doing your exercises for months.  Thank you.",
    "Started it 10 days ago and i am loving it , does anyone still doing it in 2024 ?"
