  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Structured & Disciplined' with a very high confidence score of 0.9. This is evidenced by the workout being described as the 'perfect workout' to learn calisthenics, emphasizing progression and avoiding beginner mistakes, which is characteristic of structured and methodical training. The inclusion of working 'ALL muscle groups' and focusing on core strength and balance further supports this categorization, as it suggests a comprehensive and disciplined approach.\n\nThe secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm,' has a moderate score of 0.5. This classification is supported by the notion of working on balance, which often involves fluid, controlled movements, as well as the emphasis on bodyweight exercises that generally require a degree of rhythm and coordination. However, the lack of explicit mentions of music or continuous flow means the confidence here is not as high.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were not prioritized due to the beginner-friendly nature and lack of focus on speed or maximum intensity."
