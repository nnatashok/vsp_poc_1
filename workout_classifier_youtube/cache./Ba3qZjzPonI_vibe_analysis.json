  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is identified as 'low impact, high intensity,' suggesting it provides a balance between intensity and joint safety, fitting 'The Endorphin Wave' as it likely promotes a feel-good, steady-energy experience throughout its 30 minutes. This is supported by the description, which highlights it as challenging and fun, a common feature of this vibe. The user comments reflect emotional encouragement and a positive impact on the mood after completion, further underpinning the endorphin-boosting effect. With the phrase 'challenging,' the workout shows a degree of intensity, aligning somewhat with 'The Warrior Workout,' which embodies primal energy found in intense cardio sessions. The Body Project channel focuses on inspiring others through high energy, which complements both vibes. However, the 'Warrior' aspect is somewhat moderated by the low-impact nature, thus a slightly lower score. The supportive, realistic coaching style also strays away from the pure primal intensity of a typical 'Warrior' workout, justifying the dual classification."
