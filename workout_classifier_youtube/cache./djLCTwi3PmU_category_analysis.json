  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Yoga' with a high score of 0.95. This is strongly supported by multiple pieces of metadata: the title clearly mentions 'Yoga Flow,' and the description highlights elements such as 'vinyasa flow,' 'poses to stretch, strengthen and center,' and the creator's background as a registered Yoga Teacher. The entire focus of the video and the channel is on yoga, and the description emphasizes a 'full body sequence of poses' that are characteristic of a yoga practice.\n\nThe secondary category, 'Stretching,' is relevant with a score of 0.6 because the description refers to 'a full body sequence of poses to stretch,' focusing on flexibility, hip openers, and backbends which commonly involve stretching elements. The flow nature in vinyasa yoga typically includes substantial stretching components.\n\n'Yoga' was chosen over related categories like 'Pilates' or 'Mat' due to specific references to vinyasa and the creator's clear identity as a Yoga professional. Comments also reinforce the calming and nature-oriented aspects customary to yoga practices. The confidence in these classifications is very high due to explicit and consistent references across all metadata points."
