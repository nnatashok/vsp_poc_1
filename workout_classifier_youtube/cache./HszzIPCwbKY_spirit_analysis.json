  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is evident from both the title and description which highlight a 'guided workout' format and the presence of 'form tips' and 'modifications', indicating methodical progress and precision. The channel's consistent release schedule ('2 sessions released a week') and the structured plan (complete 'each workout 1-2x over a six-week period') further support this classification, leading to a high score of 0.8 for this spirit.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is moderately represented. The mention of 'SWEAT together', 'intense enough to spark the change', and 'fast help you achieve your fitness goals' suggest a certain level of intensity and energy, though not as overwhelming as other potential workouts on this channel, resulting in a score of 0.6. \n\nThe channel's emphasis on diverse programs and modifications, combined with the workout's full-body focus and real-time guidance, support the presence of these spirits, excluding soothing or outdoor elements."
