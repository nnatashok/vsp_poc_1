  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Meditation' with a score of 0.9, due to the video's explicit focus on guided meditation as indicated by repeated mentions in the title ('Guided Meditation for Anxiety'), description, and tags such as 'meditation', 'guided meditation', and 'mindfulness meditation for anxiety'. The channel's content focus on mental health further supports this classification. The high number of views and likes suggests this content is resonating with viewers as a meditation tool.\n\nAdditionally, 'Breathing exercises' is considered with a score of 0.5, despite the lack of direct mention in the metadata. This inference is based on typical elements of guided meditation sessions that involve breathing to help calm anxiety, as seen in comments appreciating the calming effect. While not overtly detailed in the metadata, mindful breathing is likely a component of the meditation, thus it received a moderate score.\n\nOther potential categories like 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were not considered due to lack of physical movement focus in the metadata and comments."
