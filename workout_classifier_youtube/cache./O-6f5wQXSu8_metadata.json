    "I might be scared. I might be anxious. I might be panicked. But in all those situations, I know that I can remain calm. I can handle my emotions. I can remain strong. I can do it. I can get through. It will be okay in the end. I love myself, and hereby, I promise to try staying positive, even when my overthinking tries to pull me down. I will not let my anxiety take over me. I can take control of myself and I will. I will stay strong. I will not give up. Now, I let go of all my negative irrational feelings and fears. Goodbye.",
    "Did anyone else feel like he just took a walk through your mind? Before this I was shaking from anxiety. I completely felt every word that he said, and could visualize my stress floating away! This is so powerful",
    "if ur reading this, which is pretty rare, i want to let u know i\u2019m proud of u and we will get through this together. ur so strong \u2764\ufe0f",
    "Thinking about how many people return to this meditation everyday , like myself. there\u2019s somebody else out there maybe down the street ,maybe thousands of miles away,experiencing what I am in this moment. If you\u2019re reading this you aren\u2019t alone.I know it\u2019s easier said than done, read through these comments. Imagine all of us right next to you holding your hand and understanding exactly what you\u2019re going through in this moment. we all made it another day and you\u2019re going to too.",
    "Everyone who sees this: You\u2019re beautiful, and never give up your dreams, you are on this world for a reason!\u2764\ufe0f"
