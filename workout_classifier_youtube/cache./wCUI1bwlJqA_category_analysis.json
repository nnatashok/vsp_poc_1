  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is primarily classified as 'Yoga' based on the title 'Boost Recovery with Full Body Stretch Yoga for Athletes' and extensive use of tags referring to yoga practices, such as 'yoga for athletes', 'yoga class', and 'full body yoga'. The video's description reinforces this by describing it as a yoga class suitable for recovery and beginners, managed by registered yoga teachers with diverse yoga training. The clear emphasis on yoga is also supported by top comments appreciating the yoga practice.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Stretching' with a moderate score, as the class is specifically designed for recovery, emphasizing flexibility and mobility, indicated by tags such as 'yoga stretch' and 'yoga for mobility'. Comments like 'more 30 minutes recovery stretch for athlete videos' support this focus on stretching.\n\n'Breathing exercises' are also somewhat present, as the holistic nature of yoga involves breath work, suggested by the mention of mindfulness and breathing, though not a primary focus, resulting in a lower score for this category. Other potential categories were excluded due to the lack of specific references to other forms of exercise or equipment, establishing high confidence in the selected categorization."
