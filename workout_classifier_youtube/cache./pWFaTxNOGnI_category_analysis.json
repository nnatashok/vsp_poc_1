  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Breathing exercises,' as indicated by the video title, which explicitly mentions 'Breathing Exercises to Stop Panic Attack.' The description elaborates that it is a 'breathing exercise' designed to alleviate panic attacks and stress by extending exhalation. Tags such as 'breathing techniques,' 'calm breathing,' and 'breathing exercises for anxiety relief' reinforce this classification, leading to a very high confidence score of 0.97.\n\nWhile the video could slightly overlap with 'Meditation,' given its focus on relaxation and calming effects, the central theme is clearly on structured breathing techniques rather than broader mindfulness or meditative practices. This secondary category is considered with a score of 0.4 due to potential crossover effects common in breath-focused relaxation exercises, though it's not the core focus."
