  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout has strong elements of the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, with a score of 0.8, due to its focus on being a gentle, safe, and pregnancy-appropriate cardio routine. Phrases like 'gentle yet effective' and 'safe pregnancy workout' from the title and description underline the focus on safety and relaxation. This is further supported by comments appreciating the easy-going nature of the workout, which is critical for a soothing experience during pregnancy.\n\nThere is also a secondary element of 'Flow & Rhythm', with a score of 0.5, as the workout includes cardio elements that likely involve rhythmic movement. This spirit is suggested by the mention of 'cardio workout' in the tags and description, indicating some continuous movement patterns. The spirit 'High-Energy & Intense' is excluded given the explicit emphasis on being pregnancy safe and the feedback on maintaining a gentle approach.\n\nOverall, the video prominently provides a restorative approach suitable for prenatal and postpartum fitness, with gentle rhythmic movements."
