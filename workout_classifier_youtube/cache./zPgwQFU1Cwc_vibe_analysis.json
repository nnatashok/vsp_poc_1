  "vibesExplanation": "The metadata strongly indicates a vibe focused on relaxation and mindful breathing. The title, '12-minute meditation: Diaphragmatic breathing,' and tags like 'breathing meditation' and 'diaphragmatic breathing meditation' suggest a focus on breath-centered practice, which aligns well with 'The Zen Flow'. The short duration and aim to focus attention while letting go of thoughts, as seen in the description and top comments, support a calming, grounding experience. The comment describing the meditation as 'calm, straightforward, and practical' with a focus on rootedness and grounding further supports this vibe selection. With a clear emphasis on calming and focusing the mind through breathwork, this aligns closely with 'The Zen Flow' with a high confidence score of 0.8. \n\nAdditionally, 'The Deep Recharge' is relevant due to the video's emphasis on relaxation and nervous system reset, suggested by comments mentioning relaxation, grounding, and a non-overthinking approach. The tension-release aspect, supported by comments about the meditation helping with gastritis, justifies a secondary classification with a score of 0.6. There is less focus on physical movement, making other categories like 'The Comfort Moves' or 'The Reboot Workout' less suitable."
