  "vibesExplanation": "The chosen vibes are informed heavily by recurring themes of gentle movement and a focus on balance and mindfulness, as seen in both the video title and across multiple metadata points. **The Zen Flow** is a strong match (score: 0.8) due to the description emphasizing 'finding your center,' balancing the body and mind, and the use of terms like 'gentle flow,' all indicative of a slow and intentional practice akin to 'slow-flow yoga.' This vibe reflects a meditative and breath-focused workout.\n\n**The Reboot Workout** is also applicable (score: 0.7) because the video is described as promoting 'warm up, stretch,' and it offers postural improvement, aligning with low-stress total-body refreshment typically found in gentle Pilates or yoga practices. \n\nThen, **The Comfort Moves** is suitable (score: 0.7), emphasized by user comments highlighting accessibility ('beginner-friendly') and safety ('gentle yet effective'), fitting the description of safe, cozy movement.\n\nUser comments and community feedback reinforce these vibes mentioning the video\u2019s accessibility, effectiveness, and gentle nature, while excluding high-intensity or very structured vibes. This justifies the high confidence level of 0.85."
