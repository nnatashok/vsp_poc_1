  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is best classified under 'Mat' due to the nature of the exercise being primarily seated and performed without any equipment beyond a chair. Evidence for this classification is the repeated mention of 'seated exercises' in the description and tags, as well as the instructions which involve exercises that fit into the typical format of a floor workout on a mat-like surface (e.g., Hollow Rock Hold). The score of 0.7 is given as it predominantly involves mat-based movements without requiring a physical mat.\n\n'Body weight' is also a suitable category as all mentioned exercises (e.g., seated jabs, hip lifts) rely solely on the weight of the body for resistance, with no additional equipment required beyond a chair. This category receives a score of 0.6 since all exercises utilize body weight and are aimed at raising the heart rate and strengthening core muscles.\n\n'Other' is considered with a score of 0.4 due to the unique format of a seated workout which might not fully align with traditional categories. This choice is informed by the video's appeal to users with specific physical limitations, such as those recovering from knee injuries, which is reflected in the comments and the channel\u2019s description of providing inclusive workouts."
