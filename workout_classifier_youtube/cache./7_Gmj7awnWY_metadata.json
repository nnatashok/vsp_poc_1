    "i&#39;m a 55 year old male and post a heavy shoulders and triceps workout i tried these stretches for the first time, 10 minutes after doing this i started to tremble all over and had to lay down for 30 minutes. when i got off my bed i felt great and 3 weeks later am noticing that both my flexibility and breathing are improving. thank you for helping to improve my life",
