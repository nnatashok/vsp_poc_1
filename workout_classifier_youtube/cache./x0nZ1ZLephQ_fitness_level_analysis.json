  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is predominantly 'Beginner,' supported by the light effort and minimal technique difficulty associated with meditation. The video's theme and the creator's channel emphasize accessibility for all levels, suggesting inclusivity for beginners. Comments indicate a focus on mental practice and relaxation rather than physical challenge, which aligns with beginner-level accessibility. The slight consideration for 'Intermediate' stems from the possibility of deeper engagement in meditation practice, as some comments mention having to improve focus, which might be more challenging for those unaccustomed to meditation."
