  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this video is \"Soothing & Restorative.\" The title and description emphasize meditation, relaxation, and spiritual healing, which aligns perfectly with the goals of a soothing and restorative session. Keywords like \"meditation experience,\" \"inner strength,\" \"relax,\" and \"recharge\" strongly suggest this spirit. The video's popularity, with over 7 million views, and positive user comments further support its impact as a restorative practice, with users mentioning healing and positive mindset shifts as outcomes. The confidence level is very high (0.9) due to the strong consistency of the metadata.\n\n\"Flow & Rhythm\" is moderately reflected as a secondary spirit. The meditation guides viewers through a continuous mental journey, which can be rhythmical as participants are encouraged to \"visualise and start feeling\" each guided thought. The transition through stages of meditation and visualization could have elements of rhythmic progression, evidenced by comments about feeling connected to oneself and spiritually moved. However, the flow is more mental than physical, leading to a moderate score (0.5), as the primary focus remains on soothing and restorative effects."
