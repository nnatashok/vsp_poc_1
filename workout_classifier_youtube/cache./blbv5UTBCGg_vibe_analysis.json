  "vibesExplanation": "The workout described in the metadata is a 10-minute guided pranayama session focused on breathing and inner balance, clearly emphasizing a grounding and intentional approach, making 'The Zen Flow' the most suitable vibe. Key terms like 'inner balance,' 'mindful breathing techniques,' 'pranayama for relaxation,' and 'guided meditation' strongly indicate a slow-paced, breath-centered practice. This vibe aligns well with the channel's focus on yogic practices aimed at mental and spiritual health. The high view count and positive engagement suggest an effective delivery of these qualities, justifying a score of 0.9 due to strong alignment with the vibe.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Deep Recharge' is also applicable as the session aims to relax and balance the Chakras, supporting nervous system reset and gentle movement. Tags like 'pranayama for stress relief' and phrases about energizing the body and mind further emphasize this vibe, earning a 0.7 score. There is little indication of dynamics that define more intense or rhythmic vibes, thus excluding them from consideration."
