  "vibesExplanation": "The video title and description emphasize relaxation and stretching, suggesting a low-intensity, grounding approach typical of 'The Zen Flow.' The terms 'relaxation' and 'stretching routine' reinforce this vibe, and a score of 0.75 reflects the consistent focus on slow, intentional movement. Additionally, the encouraging daily implementation aligns with 'The Reboot Workout,' hinting at a refreshing, restorative quality that is supportive of total body refresh - hence a score of 0.65. The tags and comments indicate users of various skill levels are seeking to improve flexibility, suggesting elements of 'The Foundation Builder,' which focuses on strengthening weak points and perfecting basics. However, the strong emphasis on relaxation over corrective approach means this vibe scores a moderate 0.4. Other potential vibes, like 'The Comfort Moves,' were excluded due to the absence of cozy or gentle movement indicators; rather, the focus is on flexibility progression."
