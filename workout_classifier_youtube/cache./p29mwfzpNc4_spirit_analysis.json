  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is identified as predominantly 'Soothing & Restorative' based on strong explicit indicators in the title, description, and tags that emphasize healing, peace, and stress relief. The title '15 Minute Guided Meditation' and description focus on 'welcoming peace,' 'letting go,' and 'connecting with non-physical elements,' which are clear signs of a meditative and restorative approach. Tags such as 'meditation for calming the mind,' 'meditation for healing,' and 'best meditation for stress' further underscore the restful and therapeutic aim. The channel's broader offerings and user comments highlight personal healing experiences, reinforcing the classification with a confident score. Other spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Flow & Rhythm' were considered unlikely due to the non-physical, introspective nature of the session, which doesn't emphasize structured progression or dynamic movement."
