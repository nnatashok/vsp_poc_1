  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Breathing exercises' with a score of 1, as the title, description, and tags all focus on guided breathwork techniques designed to reduce stress and enhance focus. Keywords like 'guided breathwork,' 'dirga pranayama,' and mentions in the description about improving lung capacity strongly indicate a focus on controlled breathing exercises for relaxation and mental clarity. The secondary category is 'Meditation' with a score of 0.6, evidenced by tags such as 'morning meditation,' 'mindfulness meditation,' and 'guided meditation,' as well as phrases in the description highlighting mindfulness and mental focus. Despite the meditation elements, the primary focus remains on breathing, hence the lower score for the 'Meditation' category. The video's metadata lacks indicators for any of the other categories."
