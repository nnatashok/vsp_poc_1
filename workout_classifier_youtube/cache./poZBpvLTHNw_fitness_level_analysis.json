  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is described as a 'Feel Good Yoga Flow', which suggests a focus on smooth, flowing movements that aren't overly complex. Phrases like 'stretch and feel good' imply a calming, less technical practice. Comments and channel information emphasize accessibility and the instructor's inclusive teaching style, typically suitable for beginners. However, Vinyasa yoga can include intermediate poses, warranting some consideration for an 'Intermediate' level due to its requirement for moderate coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 21-minute duration and description of 'breathe, stretch and feel good' suggest a low-effort, calming session typical of light yoga. The absence of mentions of cardio or high energy expenditure supports a 'Light' rating. Tags and description elements indicating a 'feel good' focus reduce the likelihood of significant physical exertion. 'Moderate' is considered due to the potential variability in personal exertion during yoga postures.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the Technique and Effort difficulty scores, this workout is suitable primarily for beginners, reflected in the channel\u2019s focus on inclusive, feel-good movement. There's a secondary consideration for intermediate users due to the Vinyasa element, which may introduce slightly more complex sequences. Comments reinforce the accessibility and transformative nature of the practice, making it beginner-friendly, but leaving room for improvement and engagement for intermediates."
