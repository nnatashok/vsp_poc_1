  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, scoring a strong 0.9. The video focuses on relieving back tension and general pain with gentle yoga movements, clearly described in the title and description. This aligns with the spirit's emphasis on recovery and relaxation. Phrases like 'help relieve back tension' and 'increase mobility, flexibility and release tension' further reinforce the restorative nature, supported by user comments expressing relief and relaxation after performing the routine. \n\nA 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present, albeit to a lesser degree (0.6). The session, characterized by the 6 dynamic movements of the spine\u2014flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation\u2014suggests a guided, rhythmic sequence inherent in yoga practices, as supported by user feedback highlighting the flow of movements and music, emphasizing coordination and mindfulness. The video lacks high intensity or structured planning typical of other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined.'"
