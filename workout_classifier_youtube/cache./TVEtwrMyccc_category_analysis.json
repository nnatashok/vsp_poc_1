  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Calisthenics,' which is strongly supported by explicit references in the title, description, tags, and channel theme. The title '30 Min CALISTHENICS FULL BODY WORKOUT' directly indicates calisthenics, and the repeated mention of calisthenics in tags such as 'beginner calisthenics,' 'full body Calisthenics,' and 'bodyweight calisthenics' confirms this categorization. The description further supports this as it mentions a 'full body Calisthenics workout... with no equipment.' As calisthenics is a form of exercise using body weight, the 'Body weight' category also applies with a moderate score of 0.6, highlighting the workout's reliance on body weight exercises. However, it is primarily calisthenics-focused. 'Other' is included with a low score of 0.2 to account for any additional elements not strictly defined by the main categories, but the workout is predominantly calisthenics-focused. Overall confidence in these categories is high at 0.85 due to the strong alignment of metadata with the calisthenics classification."
