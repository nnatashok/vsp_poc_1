  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the workout is 'Structured & Disciplined', scoring 0.85. This is evidenced by the detailed breakdown of exercises, including specific weights, the emphasis on form, and the suggestion of progressing through a structured program over 4-8 weeks. The focus on muscle strengthening and form adjustments over time highlights a disciplined training regimen. \n\n'High-Energy & Intense' was also selected, scoring 0.65. Despite being low impact, comments like 'pushes you hard' and 'feel amazing' after the workout reflect an intense experience, indicative of effort-driven progress. The use of moderately heavy weights and full body engagement supports an intense physical engagement.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is less relevant due to the structured nature and focus on muscle training rather than smooth, dance-like movements. Similarly, 'Soothing & Restorative' does not fit as the session aims for increase in strength rather than relaxation or recovery."
