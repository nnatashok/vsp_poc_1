    "The  first 10 minutes  of the beginning of my change \ud83e\udd70 wish me luck 30 days challenge \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f",
    "We tackled assembling the bike as a family project. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxzg0clhbtRf2gGxPkVETFKJJKGqdsorQu\">https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxzg0clhbtRf2gGxPkVETFKJJKGqdsorQu</a>  The package is heavy, but I have 2 teen boys that were able to move it. The written instructions were great- we didn&#39;t need to watch the videos, but it was good knowing that the option was there if we needed it. After we were able to get it set up, the boys each rode 3 miles and I rode 8 and the bike stayed quiet. The display is easy to reset, and you can put it on whichever setting you are using (time, distance, calories, etc). I will say that my butt is a little sore from the seat, but that could be because I haven&#39;t rode in a while. While it is comfortable for me, it was not comfortable with the seat position for my friend (could not move the seat back far enough and he slightly looked like a kid riding a tricycle that he had outgrown). He also said that the seat hurt his manly parts. We are going to look for a different seat that will be compatible with this bike for him.I did purchase the Wahoo Cadence sensor and strapped it to the crank of one of the pedals. This will sync with my Apple Watch, iPhone and will import data in to my Health app. Wahoo does have other sensors available other than cadence. I can also keep either my phone or my iPad on the display and they both feel pretty secure.",
    "This is a great 10 minute workout, I am 72 years old and recently got a Keiser bike at home and this is a welcome break from my office work 1 of 2 time a day, thanks for this video!",
    "This is officially going to be my new warmup routine before all my lifts. Great way to get the blood pumping! I did this followed by tabata resistance training this morning and it was a perfect pairing."
