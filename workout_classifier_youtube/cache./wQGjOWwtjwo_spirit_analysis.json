  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled \"Shower of Grace | A Guided Meditation with Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar\" is deeply rooted in the spirit of 'Soothing & Restorative'. This is evident from terms like 'guided meditation', 'cut down stress, anxiety, and depression', 'maximize happiness, health & immunity', and 'powerful breathing technique'. The language focuses on stress reduction and relaxation, typical of a restorative spirit. The description promotes mindfulness practices such as Pranayama and Sudarshan Kriya, further emphasizing a calming, restorative energy. I assigned a high score of 0.9 due to the strong restorative indicators.\n\nThere are minor elements reminiscent of 'Flow & Rhythm', particularly related to coordinated practices like Pranayama and Sudarshan Kriya that may involve rhythmic breathing patterns. However, these elements are not as emphasized, justifying a lower score of 0.4. The other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' do not fit the meditative and restorative nature of this video, hence were not considered significant."
