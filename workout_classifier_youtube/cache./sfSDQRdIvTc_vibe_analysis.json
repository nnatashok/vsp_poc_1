The consistent user feedback about feeling peaceful and grateful after the session further supports this classification. Score for 'The Deep Recharge' is high at 0.85 due to explicit mentions of calmness, peace, and relaxation.\n\n'Zen Flow' is also relevant because of the breath-centered and intentional aspect of the guided meditation practice, which is a common feature of this vibe.
