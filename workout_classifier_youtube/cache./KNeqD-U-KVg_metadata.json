    "I\u2019ve done this full body stretch for one month straight and let me say omggg!!! The improvement in my flexibility is insane !! This is coming from someone who\u2019s had stiff joins due to an illness, but I\u2019ve healed and this after my exercise was just everything ! It calmed down my body ( Inhale w ur nose and exhale w ur mouth for better breathing ) and like I can literally move my body around so freely! Like ofc at the beginning it was hard to hold but after consistency it became a breeze ! And I\u2019ve got to say I have less joint pains, back aches are gone and my posture is wayyy better. Thank you so much for this amazing stretch! <br>I totally recommend it to others because it\u2019s just so lovely to end your workouts with \u2764.",
