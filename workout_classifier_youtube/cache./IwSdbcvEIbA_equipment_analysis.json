  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title \"50 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT || At-Home Pilates\" suggests it is a Pilates workout which typically requires minimal equipment. The description explicitly states \"All you need is yourself and a mat, no equipment needed.\" This indicates a very high confidence that a mat is the only required equipment, as it is specifically mentioned as necessary. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata, tags, or comments. Therefore, the classification is made with very high confidence that only a mat is needed for this at-home Pilates workout."
