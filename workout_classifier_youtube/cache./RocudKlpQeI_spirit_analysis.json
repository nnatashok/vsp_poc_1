  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative'. The classification as 'Structured & Disciplined' is supported by the structured format focusing on a progressive workout routine for beginners. The routine emphasizes specific exercises like squats, calf raises, and planks, which indicates a methodical approach to building foundational strength (confidence 0.7). Additionally, the video is aimed at beginners and is designed as a low-time commitment with the encouragement to repeat for increased challenge, suggesting a disciplined, planned progression. \n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' classification is due to the low-intensity nature of the exercises and the focus on introducing movement and promoting a sense of ease into daily life, as seen in comments that highlight it as a suitable routine for those with physical constraints or busy schedules. This aligns with the calming, accessible nature of restorative workouts (confidence 0.6). The absence of high-intensity keywords or competitive elements excludes other categories, cementing focus on foundational and restorative aspects."
