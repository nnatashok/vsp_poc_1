  "channelDescription": "Hypnosis | Hypnotherapy | Sleep Hypnosis | Guided Meditation\n\nHi, my name is Michael and welcome to my channel, where I hope you can stop by to relax, listen in, and see for yourself the power of positive hypnosis.\n\nHypnosis is a completely natural state of often deeply felt relaxation and focused attention, where positive suggestions can be more easily accepted by our subconscious minds. Imagine a fantastic and tranquil state of daydreaming, and that is very close to hypnosis!  \n\nHypnosis can bring us improved self control, clearer and empowered behavioural choices, and allow us to listen to our best inner resources. Many people experience a deep sense of calmness and serenity during hypnotic meditation and are often pleasantly surprised to see the ongoing, life enhancing results. \n\nThank you greatly for your support, feel free to subscribe and comment on your great results, and I trust you will benefit from your time spent with positive hypnosis.\n\nPeace & Enjoy",

    "When it gets to 4.00 in the morning and the ill-health and  depression is really settling in then Michael is my go- to place.",
    "10 week old puppy was crying in her crate. I clicked Michael&#39;s voice. Pup began to quiet almost instantly. I turned it up as much as I could on my phone. She didn&#39;t whimper when he talked. Completely silent in under 45 seconds. THANK YOU!",
    "Words don\u2019t describe the anxiety I get along with true physical symptoms. I\u2019ve been combating this as well as working with it. Your videos have done wonders in this world full of modern medicine. I cannot thank you enough for these videos. \ud83d\ude4f It\u2019s been a struggle and still is randomly dealing with my unpredictable panics and anxious moments. These moments could take up hours or days of my time, if I didn\u2019t listen to your videos. The voice is now my calm, literally. I\u2019ve woken in the middle of the night and been filled with panic, then I turn this on and it takes a few moments but normalcy and grounding comes back to me, thank you so much again. Honestly to anyone who reads this, whatever you are going through, you are not alone and you will be strong enough to get past this moment and any that may come. \u2764\ufe0f  It just takes time, trust me, then you can look back and see what you have overcome. That is where you build strength.",
    "Michael I work in a hospital and whenever a patient tells me they have trouble sleeping, I tell them to listen to you....thanks again for your wonderful video and your soothing voice. \ud83d\ude42"
