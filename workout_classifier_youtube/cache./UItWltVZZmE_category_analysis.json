  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Mat' workouts (0.9) due to mentions of basic movements performed on a mat without any equipment, as indicated by phrases like 'no equipment' and 'home workout.' The inclusion of movements like 'squat,' 'crunch,' and 'plank' supports this classification. The secondary category is 'Body weight' (0.8) as the workout is described as using 'bodyweight' in the tags and the description highlights no equipment being necessary. The emphasis on 'beginner version' and suitability for beginners, as indicated in the title and reiterated in the description and comments, reflects the workout style as a general mat-based bodyweight exercise session targeting full body engagement. The classification confidence is high (0.9) given the clarity from the title, description, and tags."
