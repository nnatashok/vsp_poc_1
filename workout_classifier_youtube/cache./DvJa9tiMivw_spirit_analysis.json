  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily aligned with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as evidenced by its description and viewer feedback. The title itself mentions 'Pilates Stretch' and 'Good Moves,' implying a focus on gentle body movement and well-being. Keywords in the tags and description, such as 'stretch routine,' 'feeling refreshed,' and 'morning pilates workout,' highlight its restorative and stress reduction qualities. Furthermore, user comments frequently mention feelings of relaxation, alleviation of tension, and a gentle morning routine, affirming the restorative nature. This spirit is scored at 0.9 due to consistent indicators across the metadata.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is a secondary spirit, as the Pilates routine likely involves continuous and rhythmic movements, important in many Pilates practices. While less emphasized, the mention of smooth stretching routines and the video series name 'Good Moves' suggest an element of flow. This spirit is scored at 0.7, as the evidence is present but not the primary focus of the session. Other spirits were excluded as the workout is clearly non-intensive, not sport-specific, and lacks outdoor elements."
