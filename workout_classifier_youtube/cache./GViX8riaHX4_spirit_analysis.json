  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is best classified under \"Structured & Disciplined\" and \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirits. The title and description indicate a highly structured workout with clear instructions, such as performing exercises for specific durations with set rests, and a focus on muscle building through a progressive approach. Terms like \"compound movement,\" \"controlled,\" and \"methodical\" suggest technical precision and discipline, earning it a 0.9 score for \"Structured & Disciplined.\" The emphasis on muscle building and use of weights, as described in the video, indicates an intense energy, supported by descriptors such as \"burn energy,\" \"stronger,\" and the compound nature of movements. This suggests a score of 0.6 for \"High-Energy & Intense.\" While it is intense, the pacing, and encouragement to focus on form, reduce its intensity compared to the highly intense high-energy workouts. \"Flow & Rhythm\" and \"Soothing & Restorative\" were not relevant given the strength-focused nature and clear structure of the workout."
