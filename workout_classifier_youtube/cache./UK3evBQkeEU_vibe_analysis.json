  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe selected is 'The Deep Recharge' with a score of 0.8, reflecting the video's focus on a calming and restorative breathing practice designed to reset the nervous system and help with anxiety and chronic conditions. This is supported by the description's emphasis on \"breathing Light, Slow and Deep\" to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system and the use of phrases such as \"mild air hunger\" and \"activates the calming parasympathetic branch of the nervous system.\" The channel's focus on healing from anxiety and chronic illnesses further reinforces this vibe.\n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Zen Flow' with a score of 0.75, as the practice involves slow and intentional breathwork, akin to meditation, focusing on breath awareness and diaphragmatic breathing. The comment section highlights a feeling of calmness, suggesting meditative qualities.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Mindful Walk' or 'The Reboot Workout' were considered but deemed less fitting given the video's focus primarily on breathwork rather than movement or passive stretching. The overall confidence is high (0.85) due to clear indicators from the metadata."
