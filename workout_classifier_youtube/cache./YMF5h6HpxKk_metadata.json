    "I came back to this meditation after 4 years. <br><br>In 2018 I decided to start my own company. I remember I was listening to this in the summer of 2018 a few months before having the idea to form my company. <br><br>Since then my business has grown double or even triple year after year. In 2021 I was even offered a buy out. <br><br>I came back to this meditation on accident in 2022 and thought back in retrospect as to how my life now truly has abundance like I could have never imagined.<br><br>Believe in yourself and stay positive \u2764\ufe0f",
    "Hi Bob, thank you for this. I started doing this meditation in August 2019. It changed my life. In November 2019 I went to a different country with a job with more than 3-times my actual monthly salary. I had the possibility of bringing my family with me in January 2020. Today in 2022, two years from that time, I am back using this vital resource. If it changed my life, I am sure it will change the life of everyone who performs it with faith and in harmony with the universe. Abundant blessings to all.",
    "I used to listen to this just to calm my mind a year ago. Little did I know that my life would transform within a year and every dream I had on mind would manifest itself in this physical world. I am back to claim more and to create more with a more vibrant energy that I possess. Keep listening. This audio creates magic that you will realize later"
