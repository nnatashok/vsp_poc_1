  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled 'Daily Calm | 10 Minute Mindfulness Meditation | Be Present' from the channel 'Calm' strongly signifies a meditative and calming practice focused on mindfulness, as explicitly stated in the title and description. The consistent tags like 'inner peace', 'Relaxation', 'Guided meditation', and 'mindfulness' reinforce this. Comments expressing gratitude for moments of silence and mindfulness resonate with the 'The Zen Flow' vibe. This vibe is assigned a high score of 0.9 due to the video's core purpose being tied to intentional, breath-centered relaxation. \n\nThe 'The Deep Recharge' vibe is also relevant, given the video's focus on decreasing anxiety and stress, emphasised in both the description and user feedback. The emphasis on 'restorative' and 're-connect' suggests a nervous system reset aspect, justifying a score of 0.7.\n\nLastly, 'The Reboot Workout' vibe is considered due to the video's low-stress and refreshing nature, aimed at providing a body and mind refresh. However, due to less emphasis on physical movement, it receives a lower score of 0.6."
