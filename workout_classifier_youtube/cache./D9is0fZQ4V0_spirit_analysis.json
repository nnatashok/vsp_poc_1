  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified as \"High-Energy & Intense\" due to phrases like \"Extreme Fat Burning Workout\" and \"sustained hard efforts,\" indicating a vigorous session. This spirit is strongly supported by comments describing the workout as \"killer\" and noting continuous improvement, implying high exertion levels. Additionally, the inclusion of music tracks known for energetic atmospheres further suggests an intense atmosphere, warranting a score of 0.9.\n\n\"Structured & Disciplined\" is also a key spirit, as the mention of targeting \"pedalling technique\" and having a session leader guide viewers through structured phases like warm-up and cool-down indicate a methodical approach. The channel's focus on cycling tips and training lends credibility to this structured essence. The organized format and precision in instructing form justify a high score of 0.8 for this spirit.\n\nAlternative spirits like \"Flow & Rhythm\" were considered but excluded due to lack of explicit focus on smooth, continuous movements or mind-body integration in the metadata."
