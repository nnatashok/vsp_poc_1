  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled 'Morning Easy Run - BotW Treadmill Run Along', with multiple mentions of 'Treadmill' in both the title and tags such as 'Treadmill' and 'Treadmill Background'. The channel description explicitly states that it provides ambient running videos 'while on the treadmill', which strongly suggests the workout is designed to be performed on a treadmill. This, combined with the video's focus on a running theme, justifies a very high confidence score of 0.9 for the use of a treadmill. The workout is virtual, inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, further emphasizing the treadmill as the necessary equipment to simulate the run."
