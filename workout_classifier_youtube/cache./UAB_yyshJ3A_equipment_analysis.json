  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"Guided Breathing: Improve Your Immune System\" focuses on breathwork and the Wim Hof Method, which typically involves breathing exercises and meditative practices. The metadata, including the title, description, and tags, emphasizes breathwork and the Wim Hof Method, both of which generally do not require any physical equipment. There are no explicit mentions of any equipment in the video metadata, and the focus is largely on the practice of breathing as a standalone activity. The comments support the notion of the video being a guided breathing session without suggesting the use of any physical equipment. Therefore, this workout appears to be bodyweight only, requiring no additional equipment."
