  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Deep Recharge' with a high score of 0.95. This conclusion is drawn from the description highlighting the practice's goal to calm the sympathetic nervous system and deeply relax participants, suitable for nervous system reset. The video's focus on rhythmic breathing and extended relaxation fits this categorization very well. \n\n'The Zen Flow,' scoring 0.85, is also a strong match due to the intentional, breath-centered nature of the 4-7-8 breathing technique. The content emphasizes slow, deliberate breath control, typical of grounding and mindfulness practices inherent in Zen Flow workouts.\n\nFurthermore, 'The Sleep Prep' is relevant, with a score of 0.9, as the video is explicitly described as helping participants fall asleep faster, an aspect commonly associated with sleep preparation activities. The comments and description support this with user testimonials about improved calmness and sleep quality.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Comfort Moves' or 'The Mindful Walk' were considered but excluded due to the specific focus on breathwork for relaxation and sleep, rather than general low-impact or meditative walking experiences."
