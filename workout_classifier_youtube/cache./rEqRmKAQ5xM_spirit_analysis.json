  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under \"Flow & Rhythm\" and \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirits, reflecting its nature and methodical approach. The key evidence for \"Flow & Rhythm\" includes the mention of song-driven segments in the description (e.g., warm-up and sprints associated with specific songs), suggesting a rhythm-centric, continuous flow of movement typical of an indoor cycling session. This spirit is scored at 0.7 as the video rides on beat-driven, smooth transitions without interruptions.\n\"Structured & Disciplined\" is evident from the well-defined session outline detailed in the description, with specific timestamps for different workout segments (e.g., warm-up, rolling hills, endurance, sprints) illustrating a progressive structure common for cycling workouts. Given the clear laydown of this structure aimed at beginners, this spirit scores 0.6.\n\"High-Energy & Intense\" was not selected despite cycling typically being intensive; the focus on beginners and staying seated reduces the intensity aspect in favor of rhythm and discipline. The fitness level adjustment tips and user comments also emphasize accommodating beginners without excessive intensity."
