  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Progression Quest' with a strong score of 0.9. The metadata indicates a focus on 'Beginners Marathon Training' which suggests a focus on methodical, incremental improvement for long-term goals like marathon running. The repetitive and endurance nature of a 60-minute treadmill run aligns well with incremental improvement and structured training plans typical of endurance training. Secondarily, the video embodies 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.7, as the long duration and repetitive nature of treadmill running can induce a meditative state where participants zone in and let repetition take over. The phrases 'long guided treadmill run' and 'inclines' suggest a consistent, focused pace throughout the session. The inclusion of stretching and walking suggests it isn't purely meditative; hence the lower score. Other vibes like 'The Endorphin Wave' were excluded due to lack of dynamic variety often associated with that vibe, focusing instead on endurance and progression."
