    "To anybody new to GWJ, I promise it works if you\u2019re consistent. I found her over 2 years ago and never went to a gym and lost 100lbs. I usually do more intense videos now but I\u2019m feeling cruddy and needed a pick me up. This was perfect. And remember, if you can only do 5 minutes or 10. That is fine. Just do 6 minutes the next day and 7 the next. It\u2019s a marathon not a sprint. Make it fun not a chore!",
    "Not me tearing up at the end of this video. It was my first time working out this long in YEARS! I promised myself that this year was going to be the year of change and its already nearly November and i havent done anything. <br><br>Thank you Jo, you really are helping me not go back on my promise to myself.",
    "I dont know if you will see my comment, Im a 30year old single female who has never worked out a day in my life, I wanted to give up so many times throughout this workout but you kept me motivated and I&#39;m glad I stayed, I had a big breakdown at the end when you said you will be with us, you have no idea how much I needed that. Im glad I completed this today, I have subscribed and will tune in everyday from South Africa, thank you for this &lt;3",
    "Everytime I do Jo\u2019s workouts I say to myself \u201cshe\u2019s doing God\u2019s work\u201d. So positive, so motivating, so humble, so sweet\u2026 I could go on &amp; on. Thank you for finding your purpose Jo\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f"
