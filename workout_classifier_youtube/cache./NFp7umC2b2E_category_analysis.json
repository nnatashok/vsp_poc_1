  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Treadmill' with a very high score of 0.95. This is due to multiple explicit indicators: the video title \"45 MIN CARDIO CALORIE BURN Treadmill Run!\" clearly mentions it, and the tags such as 'treadmill follow along run', 'treadmill workout', and 'coached treadmill run' further strengthen this categorization. Additionally, the description outlines that the entire workout involves treadmill usage with specified speeds and inclines, and the comments reinforce viewers' engagement with treadmill running sessions.\n\nThe secondary category is 'HIIT' with a score of 0.8. This is justified by the mention of a 'HIIT SECTION' in the workout structure, involving high-intensity intervals followed by recovery periods (1 minute HIIT, 30 seconds recovery). This aligns with classic high-intensity interval training characteristics. The presence of '45 minute hiit run' in the tags and the structure detailed in the description further corroborates this classification.\n\nNo other categories were deemed as relevant given the focus on treadmill running and interval training throughout the workout, indicating a high level of confidence in these classifications."
