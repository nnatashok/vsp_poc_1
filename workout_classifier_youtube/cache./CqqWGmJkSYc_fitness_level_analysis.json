  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is explicitly aimed at beginners, as indicated by the title and repeated emphasis in the description and tags. The exercises mentioned, such as diamond push-ups and pull-up holds, are basic bodyweight exercises typically classified as beginner-friendly, although they require some familiarity with calisthenics movements. The inclusion of more technical exercises like the pistol squat and initial steps towards skills such as handstands suggests a slight lean towards intermediate in technique difficulty for absolute beginners.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is composed of several bodyweight exercises and progressions, specifically designed for beginners and unlikely to be energy-intensive due to the short duration of the video (under 7 minutes). However, exercises like diamond push-ups and pistol squats require a moderate effort to complete multiple sets and reps, increasing the energy expenditure slightly above a 'light' workout for complete novices.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout explicitly targets beginners and includes foundational calisthenics exercises, establishing a strong alignment with the beginner fitness level. The mention of learning progressions towards more difficult moves, such as the handstand and planches, and the inclusion of slightly challenging exercises like diamond push-ups and pistol squats suggests that users with a foundational fitness level might also engage with the routine effectively, supporting an assignment to the intermediate level as well."
