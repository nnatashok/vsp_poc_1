  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"5 MIN DAILY STRETCH - An everyday, full body routine\" suggests the need for a mat, as the description explicitly includes a link to \"THE MAT I USE\" from Gorilla Mats. This is a strong indication that a mat is used and likely recommended for performing the stretching routine. The reference to a mat specifically designated for exercise further supports a very high confidence level of 0.9 that a mat is central to following along with this routine effectively. The type of workout, which involves floor-based stretching, typically benefits from using a mat to enhance comfort and prevent slipping, aligning with the use case described."
