  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises mentioned in the comments, such as walkout push-ups and a V-up complex, suggest basic bodyweight movements. The presence of simple modifications and lack of equipment make the technique difficulty appropriate for beginners. The user's ability to perform exercises with ease-modifications also supports a beginner to intermediate technique level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 15 minutes and users' comments describing the workout as 'ridiculously challenging' suggest a high energy expenditure within a short period, classifying the effort as challenging. However, some users, including a beginner, managed the workout, indicating it might be moderately feasible for less fit users. The format implies a consistent pace with minimal rest, resulting in a challenging intensity.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the simple technique and high effort level, the workout is suitable for beginners, especially those looking to push themselves. The challenging effort level increases the alignment with intermediate fitness; however, the availability of modifications justifies a beginner rating. User feedback from both beginners and slightly fitter individuals finding the workout very challenging supports the inclusion of both beginner and intermediate levels."
