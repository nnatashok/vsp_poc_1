  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit is 'High-Energy & Intense,' reflected by the high-intensity interval training format and phrases like 'killer High Intensity routine' and 'super intense full body movements.' The description emphasizes high heart rates, calorie burning, and fat-burning goals, which are strong indicators of this spirit. Furthermore, the routine includes 'high energy' activities such as planks, high knees, and jumps, which signify a strong push for maximum effort and endurance, supporting a score of 0.9 for 'High-Energy & Intense'.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' indicated by the integration of music ('the music is amazing!') and the description of feeling energized rather than exhausted. Although not the primary focus, the inclusion of specific songs and the emphasis on maintaining energy and motivation through music suggest a mild presence of this spirit, leading to a score of 0.3.\n\nOther spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded due to the lack of methodical structure or relaxation emphasis. The workout's home setting and focus on basic exercises without sport-specific skills exclude 'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure.' The confidence level is high (0.85) due to explicit references and the clear nature of the title and description."
