  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is specifically tagged and described as a 'beginner Pilates workout,' focusing on basic exercises suitable for novices. The channel and video emphasize clarity in instruction and ease of execution. Comments praising the workout's suitability for true beginners further indicate a low technique difficulty. However, since Pilates inherently requires some degree of body awareness and coordination, there's a mild acknowledgment of intermediate technique elements, particularly for users completely new to exercise, hence the mixed beginner-intermediate notation.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 15-minute duration and focus on beginner Pilates suggest a light effort difficulty. The description indicates it's a gentle, full-body session, underscoring minimal energy expenditure. The term 'basic Pilates' and comments by older and less physically active viewers appreciating the workout for its accessibility imply a low-intensity session. However, as Pilates can also engage deeper muscles moderately depending on the form and range of motion, a slight moderate score is considered.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given its designation specifically for beginners and positive responses from users in low to moderate fitness (e.g., older adults and those resuming exercise), the workout is clearly suitable for beginners. The gentle Pilates nature supports this. However, the slight recognition of intermediate fitness level arises from Pilates involving core engagement and control, demanding a minimal baseline fitness and awareness. This is reflected in the description's empowerment theme and the instructor's approach, which may also attract those in recovering or gently progressing stages."
