  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under the 'Meditation' category with a very high confidence (score: 0.9) because the title explicitly uses the term \"Guided Abundance Meditation\" and the description further elaborates by inviting viewers to engage in a meditation session focused on abundance. The extensive use of related tags such as 'guided meditation', 'mindfulness meditation', and 'meditation for positive energy' reinforces the focus on meditation, making it the most fitting category. Additionally, the channel Mindvalley is known for personal growth content including guided meditations, aligning well with this categorization. \nThough the video is predominantly about meditation, a secondary classification as 'Breathing exercises' with a low score (0.3) is considered due to the meditation context which could implicitly include such exercises as part of guided meditations, although there is less explicit emphasis in this video on breathing exercises specifically. No other categories were applicable due to the lack of physical activity or focus on stretching, yoga, or fitness equipment."
