  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "This video explicitly requires the use of a \"Treadmill\" as it is a treadmill workout by design. The title, tags, and description consistently mention \"treadmill,\" \"beginner treadmill workout,\" and specific types of treadmill intervals such as jogging and speed pushes. The description also references a Sunny Health & Fitness treadmill model (SF-T7917), further confirming that a treadmill is essential for performing the workout effectively. Hence, a high confidence score of 0.9 is assigned to the treadmill being necessary for this workout."
