    "(night 2 of listening) just saw a comment that said &quot;That awkward moment when you just can&#39;t name 3 good things.&quot; And... that awkward moment when you just have to focus because even if it wasn&#39;t good, it wasn&#39;t bad.. you woke up. you breathed, you rose, you put your hair up and spoke, you ate and maybe you smiled. you lived and made it through the day, with or without happiness, with or without people, with or without help. you made it through the day breathing and living, and you&#39;re on that track. love the small things.",
    "Thank you. My anxiety has been bad lately. I needed this. If you are reading this, you are worth it and you are loved. Goodnight, sweet dreams everyone!",
    "I smiled and started to cry very softly when he said \u201cyou did the best you can do\u201d because it was a hard day for me and I really did the best I can do. I hope you had an amazing day \u2764\ufe0f"
