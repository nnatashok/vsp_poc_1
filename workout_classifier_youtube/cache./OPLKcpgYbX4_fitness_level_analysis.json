  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a 29-minute duration and emphasis on low impact, this cardio workout is likely not intense. Low impact suggests a reduced energy expenditure, suitable for beginners or those seeking gentler exercises. However, the 29-minute length requires sustained effort, possibly raising the overall energy level to moderate for some deconditioned users.",
