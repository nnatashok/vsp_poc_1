  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is predominantly categorized as 'Yoga' due to multiple clear indicators throughout the metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'Gentle Yoga Flow,' and the description further confirms this by stating it's a 'yoga flow' with a 'slow and steady practice.' Comments also reflect the yoga nature, with users appreciating the restorative and gentle aspects of the practice. The channel is a dedicated yoga channel, as indicated by the channel description and the creator's credentials, alluding to extensive training in vinyasa yoga. A perfect score of 1.0 is justified given the very high confidence from explicit metadata indicators. \n\nStretching is also a significant component of the workout, as the title mentions 'Full Body Stretch to Release Tension.' The description reinforces this by describing the practice as involving 'a combination of full body stretches' for tension release. This supports a strong secondary, yet slightly less central, presence of stretching exercises, warranting a score of 0.7 under the 'Stretching' category due to overlapping content but prioritizing yoga postures."
