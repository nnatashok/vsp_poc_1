  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is described as 'beginner friendly' but also includes elements like vinyasa flow, sun salutations, and standing balances. These may require some balance, coordination, and awareness, suggesting a moderate complexity in techniques. The mention of strengthening and improving balance also points to an intermediate level of technical difficulty for novices.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "While the video is labeled as beginner-friendly, the 45-minute duration and activities like vinyasa flow, hip openers, and backbends suggest moderate physical effort. The intensity is likely further potentiated by limited rest periods typical in yoga flows. It may be seen as challenging for deconditioned individuals, especially given the comments from less experienced practitioners indicating difficulty.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout's length and inclusion of intermediate-level techniques (e.g., sun salutations, backbends) suggest it is best suited for those with some regular practice (intermediate). However, it is also described as beginner-friendly, and simpler variations or modifications likely make it accessible to beginners despite the challenge. Nonetheless, the duration and style extend into the advanced range for beginners trying to complete the entire session, resulting in a classification spanning beginner to advanced."
