  "vibesExplanation": "The workout appears to fit 'The Progression Quest' vibe due to its structured approach to calisthenics and focus on incremental skill improvement, as indicated by tags like 'calisthenics for muscle gain' and 'calisthenics training'. The inclusion of beginner to advanced variations supports a long-term improvement strategy, earning a high score of 0.75.\n\n'Combined with the channel's focus on building a strong, athletic physique, 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe applies because the video emphasizes technique and skill-building in calisthenics, particularly with Tom Peto's extensive training experience suggesting a high technical component, giving it a score of 0.65.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Disciplined Grind' vibe is reflected in the no-equipment, bodyweight nature of the workout and the emphasis on consistency and effort, mentioned in the comments about handling body weight before crazy weights and feeling challenged, warranting a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded due to the 15-minute duration and emphasis on technique over high intensity, suggesting a more methodical approach rather than purely explosive effort."
