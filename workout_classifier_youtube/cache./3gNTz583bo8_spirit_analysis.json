  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata indicates that the workout embodies a mix of 'Flow & Rhythm', 'Soothing & Restorative', and 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits. The title includes 'pilates workout', which often involves controlled and rhythmic movements, suggesting 'Flow & Rhythm'. The description features phrases like 'peaceful and energising', which align with both 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative'. User comments reinforce this, mentioning feelings of calmness, reset, and increased body awareness, typical of restorative workouts. The structured nature of pilates is evident from the instructor's certification, which complements the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, as these workouts often involve precise, methodical exercises. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are less applicable due to the focus on calmness and the lack of high-intensity or athletic elements in the metadata."
