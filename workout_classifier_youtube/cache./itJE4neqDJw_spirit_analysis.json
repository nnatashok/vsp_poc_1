  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative,' reflected with high confidence (score 0.95). This is due to the focus on stretching, flexibility, and mobility as indicated in the title '12 MIN DAILY STRETCH (full body) - for tight muscles, mobility & flexibility' and further supported by the description emphasizing it as a routine suitable for morning, before bed, or after a workout. The video aims to stretch tight muscles, contributing to recovery and relaxation.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present to an extent (score 0.5), as the incorporation of continuous movement patterns and the suggestion of a smooth routine emerge from comments that mention narrating movements, aiding the users in following along without needing to constantly view the screen. However, this is not as strong as the restorative aspect.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were not considered due to the gentle and non-intensive nature of stretching exercises. The metadata firmly supports these two primary spirits, especially considering user feedback highlighting the restorative benefits of the stretch."
