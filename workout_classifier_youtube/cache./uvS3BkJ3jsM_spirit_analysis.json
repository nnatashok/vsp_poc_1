  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to several key indicators. The title explicitly states 'INTENSE FULL BODY HIIT WORKOUT' which denotes a fast-paced, heart-pumping session aimed at maximum effort. The description reinforces this by emphasizing that the workout is 'intense' and 'will definitely get you sweating,' suggesting a vigorous activity level. The prevalence of tags such as 'hiit workout,' 'no repeat workout,' and '20 minute hiit' further support this classification, indicating a focus on high-intensity interval training.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' receives a strong score of 0.9 due to these consistently intense signals.\n\nThe secondary spirit 'Structured & Disciplined' is also evident as this workout is part of the 'Stronger Together Series,' suggesting a methodical approach involving a sequence of workouts (Days 1-5). The organized and progressive nature of a workout series fits the characteristics of structured training. Given these attributes, 'Structured & Disciplined' is assigned a score of 0.7. \n\nOther spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the intense indoor, equipment-free nature of the workout that doesn't align with those themes."
