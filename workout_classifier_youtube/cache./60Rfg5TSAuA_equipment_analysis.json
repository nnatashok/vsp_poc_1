  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled '5 MINUTE FAT BURNING MORNING ROUTINE | No Equipment Needed | HIIT | The Fitologists' explicitly states in both the title and description that no equipment is needed. The description specifically mentions that the HIIT routine targets the whole body and requires no equipment. This is further confirmed by the tags 'no equipment needed', 'bodyweight training', and 'no equipment fat burning workout'. The exercises listed, such as Gorilla Burpees, Mountain Climbers, and Plank Jacks, are all common bodyweight exercises that do not require any additional equipment. Thus, the workout is designed to be performed using just one's body weight, with a confidence score of 1.0 indicating very high confidence in no equipment being required."
