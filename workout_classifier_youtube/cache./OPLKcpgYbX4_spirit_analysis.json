  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'LOSE WEIGHT WITHOUT HURTING YOUR JOINTS | LOW IMPACT CARDIO WORKOUT' primarily aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, scoring 0.75. This classification is supported by the 'LOW IMPACT' term in the title, suggesting an exercise session that prioritizes joint health and reduces stress on the body. This content is in line with the channel's general focus on 'easy exercises' for weight loss at home, as stated in the channel description. \n\nAdditionally, there is a component of 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, scored at 0.55. Although not music-driven, the nature of low-impact cardio often involves continuous, smooth motions, which can create a flowing workout experience. This inference is supported by the lack of emphasis on intensity in the title and description.\n\nThe absence of terms suggesting structure, intensity, sports focus, or outdoor elements excludes other spirits. The confidence level in these assessments is high due to the clear indications provided in the title and description."
