    "Let all distractions come into your mind while doing meditation. Do not force them out. I believe essence of practicing meditation is just that there will be a state when you will not even realize these distractions. You will get to a point when you will be in full control. Nothing will or can bother you. That is the real peace one will experience. One will be happy. One will have power to focus on important meaningful positive things in life. Remember the power of keeping a smiling face...it is like on and off switch. Try ...as soon as you turn the switch on by having a smiling face...all things around you becomes magically calm, happy, forgiving, and positively forward looking. Keep smiling face while doing meditation.",
    "jai gurudev, today i got the fortune to see Shri Shri , live in front of me, and He meditated with us....

    "What goodness have l done to have such a Divine Guru .....let me be deserving for Him forever and ever..<br>Pranams on His Lotus Feet.."
