  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative', as evidenced by several key aspects of the metadata. The title '15-Minute Guided Meditation to Reset Your Nervous System' and the description emphasize the calming and balancing of the mind and body, typical of restorative practices. The description mentions 'simple techniques that tone the vagus nerve' and 'practice anytime you would like to quickly calm or balance,' which are clear indicators of a focus on relaxation and stress reduction. Additionally, user comments highlight feelings of relaxation and stress relief, reinforcing the soothing nature of the session. The channel's focus on meditation, yoga nidra, and restorative yoga further aligns with the restorative spirit. No other spirits fit as clearly, considering the lack of high-energy, flow, or structure-focused elements in the video."
