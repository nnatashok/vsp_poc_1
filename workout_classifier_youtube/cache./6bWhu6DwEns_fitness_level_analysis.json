  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is labeled explicitly for beginners, with tags and description repeatedly indicating it's beginner-friendly. Pilates, inherently, involves some body awareness and coordination, but reviews suggest the pacing and exercises are accessible to new exercisers. The mention of enjoying the workout without high intensity supports a Beginner classification, while some elements may be Intermediate due to the nature of Pilates requiring awareness and control.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This is a low-intensity, no-equipment Pilates workout tailored for beginners, lasting 22 minutes. Despite its accessible nature, the duration and nature of Pilates can still require some moderate effort, indicated by user comments describing it as engaging and challenging in a sustainable way, not overwhelming. The possibility of feeling a \"burn\" also suggests some moderate exertion, but overall effort remains low to moderate.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Explicitly designed for beginners, but due to Pilates requiring controlled movements, light to moderate effort, and the 22-minute duration, it also aligns with Intermediate users. Advanced users may find benefits due to the comprehensive nature of Pilates but less so in terms of challenge. Audience comments highlight it's suitable for those returning to fitness, which corroborates broad applicability. The moderate inclusion aligns with a wide range of starting fitness levels given the self-paced nature of Pilates."
