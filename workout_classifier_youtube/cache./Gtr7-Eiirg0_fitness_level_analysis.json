  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout primarily involves standing exercises using dumbbells, which are generally accessible for beginners if lighter weights are chosen. The mention of a 'follow-along' style and standing format with simple equipment suggests straightforward movements. The presence of cues like 'no wrists,' 'no planks,' and 'no pushups' points to a focus on accommodating easier movements. Comments highlight the workout as easy to follow, yet still offering a challenge, indicating a low to moderate technique complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 23 minutes suggests a sustained effort, particularly when using weights, but it's still relatively short, keeping the exertion mild to moderate. The use of medium dumbbells, like 10 lbs, suggests some level of physical demand, but not excessively challenging given the target of sculpting and strengthening rather than intense cardio. The comments reflect that the workout feels manageable yet effective, fitting both light and moderate effort levels.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique difficulty being primarily beginner-friendly and the light to moderate effort leads to the classification including beginners, with a stronger emphasis on intermediate users due to the use of 10lb dumbbells and overall workout duration. Advanced users are also included, as they can increase the intensity with heavier dumbbells or more reps as noted by the flexibility in the equipment used. The comments indicate that even regular users find value, suggesting a broader appeal across fitness levels."
