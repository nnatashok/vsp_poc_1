  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Pilates' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is directly supported by the video title, \"Standing Pilates Cardio Workout,\" and the repeated mention of 'Pilates' in both the tags and description. Additionally, the channel name 'The Girl With The Pilates Mat' clearly indicates a focus on Pilates, increasing confidence in this classification. \n\nThe secondary category 'Mat' is included with a moderate score of 0.6. This is due to the nature of 'standing' and 'low impact' exercises, which often do not require equipment beyond a mat. Although explicit mention of a mat is absent, the channel's Pilates focus and exercise style suggest mat work involvement.\n\nOther potential categories like 'Cardio' or 'HIIT' are not selected despite the 'cardio' mention, because the essence remains distinctly Pilates with some cardio elements, which is not a standalone category here. The presence of Pilates focus and channel context reduces ambiguity, thus scoring a high confidence for Pilates overall."
