  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Meditation' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is strongly indicated by the video's title 'A Message from Your Successful Future Self (Guided Meditation)', which explicitly states it's a guided meditation. The description further reinforces this, describing the session as a '15-minute guided meditation' focused on visualization and transformation. \n\nThe tags such as \"guided meditation\", \"meditation\", and \"success meditation\" support the classification, and user comments reflect a deep emotional and meditative experience, aligned with meditation practices. The channel 'Great Meditation' predominantly features meditation content, bolstering the classification.\n\nA minor score of 0.3 is given to 'Breathing exercises', since meditation often involves breathing techniques, although there's no explicit mention of breathing exercises in the metadata. Other categories like Yoga or Stretching are excluded due to the absence of physical postures or movement elements."
