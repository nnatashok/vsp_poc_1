  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.75 due to its nature of being a '15 Min Full Body Workout' that is designed to be completed swiftly with no equipment. The description emphasizes that the workout requires 'ZERO equipment with NO repeats,' indicating a focus on maintaining high intensity throughout without the need for rest periods that repeated sets might offer. Comments also support this classification by describing the workout as challenging and expressing the effort required, evidenced by users noting that it was difficult to complete yet rewarding. \n\nAdditionally, the spirit 'Structured & Disciplined' is assigned with a score of 0.65. This is based on comments praising the methodical approach of naming and labeling each exercise and providing modifications, which reflects a disciplined structure designed for precision and progression despite the workout's short duration. It's described as accessible with modifications, implying a structured plan that caters to different fitness levels. \n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were not applicable due to the explicit emphasis on intensity and structured, quick transitions rather than continuous flow or relaxation."
