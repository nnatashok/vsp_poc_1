  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit identified is 'Soothing & Restorative' with high confidence. The focus on 'Guided Breathing' and references to escaping 'The Monkey Mind' indicate a workout aimed at relaxation, mindfulness, and stress reduction, which are core elements of the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The description advises against doing this breathwork in water or when driving, suggesting a calming activity that requires focus and tranquility. Additionally, user comments highlight the calming and transformative effects of the breathing sessions, supporting this classification. 'Flow & Rhythm' is the secondary spirit identified, due to the smooth, continuous nature of guided breathing exercises that often follow rhythmic patterns. This is further supported by the mention of 'sensory directions' and a connection to existing practices like the Wim Hof method, which involves patterned breathing techniques. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the lack of intense physical exertion or complex structure in the session."
