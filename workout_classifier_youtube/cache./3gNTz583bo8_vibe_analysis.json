  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is characterized by its intent to be \"peaceful and energising,\" which aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, focused on grounding and intentional movement. This is supported by the video description and the positive, calming feedback from users, such as the comment mentioning it's perfect for calming down before a job interview. However, the mention of it being \"energizing\" leans it slightly towards an active element, hence scoring 0.7.\n\nAdditionally, the video fits 'The Masterclass Workout' due to its Pilates focus and the instructor's certification mentioned in the channel description, suggesting a technique-driven and skill-building experience. The feedback from viewers experiencing improved posture and muscle tone, typical of a structured Pilates session, reinforces this classification, scoring 0.6. \n\nThe high confidence level comes from a consistent theme in the description and comments emphasizing structure, technique, and a calming effect, while explicitly mentioning Pilates, which typically requires technical skill."
