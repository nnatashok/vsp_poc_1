    "Right now, there are people all over the world who are just like you. They\u2019re either lonely, they\u2019re missing somebody, they\u2019re depressed, they\u2019re hurt, they\u2019re scared of the past, they\u2019re having personal issues no one knows about, they have secrets you wouldn\u2019t believe. They wish, they dream and they hope. And right now, they are sitting here reading these words, and I\u2019m writing this for you so you don\u2019t feel alone anymore. Always remember, don\u2019t be depressed about the past, don\u2019t worry about the future, and just focus on today. If today\u2019s not so great don\u2019t worry! Tomorrow\u2019s a new chance. If you are reading this, be sure to share this around to make others feel better. Have a nice day! \u2764\ufe0f",
    "this meditation is my favorite one out of all the ones i\u2019ve tried before. the part where it instructs you to imagine a place of peace had me crying because i have severe anxiety and panic disorder and i\u2019ve never felt that much peace before. i will be back to return to that space when i need it. i feel REJUVENATED!!! \u2764\ufe0f"
