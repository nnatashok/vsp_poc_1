  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled \"5 Min. Morning Stretch | Full Body Flexibility Routine for Beginner\" suggests a \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit due to its focus on stretching, flexibility, and relaxation.

User comments reflect a sense of calm, peace, and a positive start, highlighting how the routine feels relaxing and energizing, supporting its classification as \"Soothing & Restorative\" with a high confidence score of 0.9.\n\nThe \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit is also relevant, as the routine is likely to involve continuous, coordinated movements set to music.
