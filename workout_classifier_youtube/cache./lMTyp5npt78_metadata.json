    "Hello Adrienne, Thankfully, I want to share with you that my daughter (22years old ) and I (58 years old) have been doing Yoga with you, since pandemia started in Mexico by the middle of March 2020. We started with your 30 day yoga videos, the first time we finished the sequence of the complete 30 days including Saturdays and Sundays, we felt so successful and grateful to you ( you will never know how much yo have helped to our physical and mental health. <br>We live in Cuernavaca , Morelos, Mexico. After the third month of your 30 days videos, we started to pick a different video for each day, according our necessities as you always say \u201c listening to the needs of our bodies\u201d , for lower back, for upper back, to relax, to sleep, etc . We do yoga with you every day, now we are doing it from Monday to Friday but if one of us is in pain or in need we do it even on Saturday or Sunday. What you have done putting your videos at no cost and available to everybody no matter where we are. That is the way we found you and you have really reached to us. We love you Adrienne. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EXISTING, AND DO WHAT YOU DO. YOU ARE AWSOME. We admire you so much. We sent you our very best wIshes for whatever you need. THANK YOU SOOO SOOOOO MUCH. From Mexico with love.",
