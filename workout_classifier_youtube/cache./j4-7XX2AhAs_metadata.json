    "Made with love after delving into my own healing journey with the nervous system which my body definitely called on me to address (Via body anxiety and panic attacks a couple years ago.) It&#39;s an ongoing process and almost everyone can benefit from short and consistent practices that help us tune into our individual nervous system health and utilize the tools to guide back toward homeostasis. It can also just feel good to give these issues visibility and allow there to be more accessible shame free support. I got you. Thank you for sharing your practice with me.",
    "Awaken day 12\ud83c\udf89 thank you, Adriene, perfect Saturday practice and is just what my body needed, I&#39;ve been tired all day due to a hard night trying to get to sleep, hopefully tonight will be better after this practice. \ud83d\udc96\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",
    "A short and sweet reset. Why do I feel so good after this practice?! I didn&#39;t think I was feeling nervous, but now I am much relieved. Thanks, Adriene, for every day&#39;s cure.",
    "I started watching these at 19\u2026 I\u2019m 27 now and still pop in when I need more guidance thank you!!!!",
    "My yoga space today was filled with bright sunshine through the window. It was really lovely to reside in its light. I allowed my breath to flow however it wanted, no resisting or pushing. Thank you for such a loving start to the day!"
