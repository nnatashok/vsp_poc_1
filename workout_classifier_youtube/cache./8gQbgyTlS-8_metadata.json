To start, create a simple routine consisting of basic movements such as push-ups, squats, and sit-ups. Make sure to warm up properly with light cardio and stretching to prevent injury. Start with low reps and gradually increase as you get stronger. Incorporate rest days into your routine to allow your muscles time to recover. Remember to focus on form over speed and use modifications if needed. With consistency and dedication, you'll see improvement in your strength and mobility.",

    "10/7/23 - Started doing these exercises in September, commenting now because I was able to stay consistent. First month I already see muscle growth, it\u2019s actually crazy. Gonna comment again by the end of the year<br>EDIT- For my workout routine I like to do chest, arms, and shoulders in one day and abs, back, and legs the next day and just alternate for 5 days a week. I recommend searching up a diet plan as well to get improved results. Also minor note I have been biking for a year so my legs are in decent shape but it was not working out every part of the legs. This is also what got me into calisthenics because only my legs had muscles definition and the rest of my body was all flab.<br>12/31/23 - I stayed consistent and I\u2019ve noticed major growth in my arms, upper chest and traps. Minor but still noticeable growth in forearms, lower chest and shoulders. Endurance and amount of reps has improved as well. Many of the harder exercises I couldn\u2019t do, I can do now. Gonna keep on grinding and update my progress in March.<br>3/2/24 - I\u2019m so excited to give you all my calisthenics update! Forearms are looking more defined and bigger. Shoulders have steady progress. My chest fat has slowly been burning away and is being replaced with muscle!! I never thought i would be able to get rid of this! I\u2019ve gotten a few compliments of my arms and it just gives me motivation to keep going. I can do a pistol squat and an L sit!! I tried doing pistol squats around November and I could not do them at all, I tried again last month and I was surprised I was able to go all the way down and back up!! The same thing with L sit, I can only hold it for 5 seconds but it\u2019s so much better from when I first started. I wasn\u2019t able to lift my feet up at all and I thought it was because my legs were too long. Still working on my handstand too, I was able to hold multiple attempts for 3 seconds but my biggest struggle is balance and I get scared. I\u2019m gonna update again in the summer! Wish everyone the strength to keep going through their workouts! It\u2019s worth it!!<br>6/25/24 - Ngl I haven\u2019t consistently been doing my workouts recently bc I got a girlfriend and we\u2019ve been hanging out everyday so I\u2019ve been lacking. Today I\u2019m going back to consistently doing my workouts again. My first day back felt exactly how I felt when I first began my journey. I got pretty sore for 4 days so I couldn\u2019t really do my workouts. My second day back today and I\u2019m feeling better and I\u2019m trying to push myself even more bc I don\u2019t want to break my streak again. I\u2019ll update again in August<br>8/24/24 - I\u2019m almost hitting the 1 year mark!! Not much of my workout routine has changed but I did add an explosive push-up variation to my incline. I tried getting some running and swimming in as well. I have been wanting to go to the gym to grow a bit more. I don\u2019t want to overdo going to the gym because I still want to be flexible. I tried going 1-2 times a week. I\u2019m getting an insane amount of compliments on my forearms compared to last year. Arm veins have also been popping out so that\u2019s a plus for anyone who has been going for those. After tons of practice, I\u2019ve been able to do a handstand!! Still working on my balance and being to hold it till failure. I\u2019m really glad I started these workouts. Every time someone asks me if I go to the gym, I tell them I just do calisthenics at home and they get so surprised. I started my logs as an inspiration for others because I know if I saw a comment like this I would totally be inspired. Especially if they\u2019re still updating to this day!!<br>10/16/24 - Still doing my workouts to this day. What a journey this has been! Over a year now! I\u2019m a totally different person than I was when I first started. All exercises have been the same and my diet has stayed the same. I do a little bit of gym to increase muscle size but also not over doing it.<br>1/3/25 Sorry for the late update, I was busy during December but that didn\u2019t stop me from trying to get whatever workout I can. I\u2019m not going to lie you guys, I didn\u2019t put in as much work as I wanted to this time around but I\u2019m still satisfied with what I was able to put in. It\u2019s honestly gotten to the point where I have the physique I\u2019ve wanted. It\u2019s just so satisfying to see everyday because I know the amount of effort I put in to achieving it. I\u2019m so glad I started. I\u2019m so glad I was able to stay consistent. I\u2019m proud of myself. It\u2019s a new year and that only means more motivation. I\u2019m gonna keep my workouts consistent. Nothing from my workout has changed significantly. The only thing is my diet. I\u2019ve been eating chicken and rice religiously. I\u2019ve been trying to gain weight so that helps with bulking. I can\u2019t wait till I start cutting. I\u2019ll update again after a while. Thank you so much for the motivation in the comments. I wish you all the best!"
