    "Hey my friends! The music changes in the middle of this video for 2 minutes so that I could take out all of the adverts that the music labels inserted into my video, so that you could follow it without interruptions! That\u2019s also why you won\u2019t hear the countdown timers for 2 minutes but it means you get to follow without any ads! \u2665\ufe0f",
    "I can\u2019t express to you how appreciated these \u201cno noise\u201d home workouts are \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc living in an apartment with neighbors under, I definitely try to steer clear of jumping HIIT movements so they don\u2019t hate me \ud83d\ude02",
    "to anyone watching this who feels discouraged - natacha is in incredibly good shape! she&#39;s extremely fit and the average person won&#39;t have her level of fitness, so please don&#39;t feel discouraged if you can only do half of this or even a quarter of it. all that matters is that you&#39;re trying your best and that you&#39;re persevering :) you got this",
    "This might sound weird but I just APPRECIATE, from the bottom of my heart, that she was not talking throughout the whole video + I like the songs she put they were enthusiastic. I hate it when in workout videos the trainer keeps talking and talking.",
