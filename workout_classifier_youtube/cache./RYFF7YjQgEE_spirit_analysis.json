  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'High-Energy & Intense'. The title and description highlight the cardio nature, which is known for elevating heart rate and boosting metabolism (\"elevate your heart-rate and boost your metabolism\"), key indicators of an intense workout. Users in the comments mention feeling a burn and getting results from consistent practice, further supporting the high-energy classification. The frequent use of 'cardio' in tags reinforces this spirit. I assigned a score of 0.75 to this spirit based on the clear emphasis on fat-burning intensity.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Structured & Disciplined', as reflected by the specified sequence and repetition of exercises: side bends, mountain climbers, etc., noted in the description and top comments. The workout follows a structured format with clear instructions not to skip exercises or pause too long, showing discipline. A score of 0.6 indicates confidence due to the presence of structured exercise lists and set recommendations in user comments. \n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm', 'Soothing & Restorative', or 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to a lack of focus on musical rhythm, relaxation, or outdoor elements."
