  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '10 MIN Guided Meditation To Clear Your Mind & Start New Positive Habits' suggests a meditation session rather than a physical workout. The description emphasizes mindfulness, finding a quiet space, and using headphones for a focused meditation experience. There is no mention of any physical workout or exercise equipment in the title, description, or tags. Comments from users reflect personal well-being and motivation related to meditation, further supporting this video as being exclusively for mental clarity and relaxation, without physical movement requiring equipment. Thus, the workout appears to be a bodyweight-only, meditative session, implying no physical equipment is required."
