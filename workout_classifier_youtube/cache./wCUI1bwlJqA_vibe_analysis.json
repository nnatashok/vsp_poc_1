  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Reboot Workout' (score: 0.9) due to its focus on recovery, stretching, and boosting athletic recovery, as indicated by the video title and description. The session is explicitly designed for full-body stretch and involves gentle movements, aligning with the Reboot vibe. 'The Zen Flow' (score: 0.8) is also a strong fit given the mindfulness and breath-centered approach mentioned in the description and user comments, emphasizing mental stillness and slow-paced movements. The comments mention relaxation and falling asleep, indicating a calm and grounding vibe suitable for this class. 'The Comfort Moves' (score: 0.6) is a relevant but less pronounced vibe as the class is beginner-friendly, described as relaxing and comfortable in nature. The emphasis on mindful, comfortable stretching further supports this classification. Other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' are excluded due to the lack of intense or high-energy elements in the workout."
