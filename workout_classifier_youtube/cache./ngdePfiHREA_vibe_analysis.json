  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this video is 'The Reboot Workout' with a score of 0.8. This is supported by evidence from the title and tags indicating a focus on flexibility and stretching, which suggests a workout designed for recovery and flexibility enhancement. The use of terms like 'stretching exercises for beginners' and 'full body stretch after workout' implies a low-intensity, rejuvenating session. User comments reinforce this, mentioning improved feelings and preference for the stretching routines.\n\n'Comfort Moves' is also relevant with a score of 0.65, given the inclusive nature of the workout catering to beginners and possibly seniors, as suggested by tags like 'stretching exercises for seniors.' This indicates a safe and approachable session suitable for all levels of fitness, aligning with HASfit's channel ethos of accommodating varied fitness levels.\n\n'Zen Flow' is included with a score of 0.5 due to the intentional and breath-centered nature of stretching exercises, although it's less emphasized compared to the recovery aspect.\n\nOverall, the video leans heavily towards a restorative and accessible session, excluding higher intensity vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter.'"
