  "vibesExplanation": "The video is classified as having strong elements of 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe due to the steady build and feel-good nature of the workout, highlighted by user comments like feeling \"powerful\" and enjoying the \"loud music.\" The repeated mention of \"low impact\" and focus on building endurance aligns well with this vibe, earning a score of 0.78.\n\n' The Meditative Grind' vibe is moderately represented as the workout involves consistent movement on an elliptical, fostering a rhythmic and disciplined experience typical of endurance activities, supported by the class structure of intervals for 17 minutes, justifying a score of 0.65.\n\nFinally, 'The Reboot Workout' is also present, though to a lesser degree, as it offers a low-impact option suitable for those with sensitive knees, providing a refreshing yet active break, reflected in phrases like \"low impact,\" and \"great endurance and strength building,\" thus scoring 0.58.\n\nThe use of 'indie house' music, the interval structure, and the focus on endurance challenge eliminate high-energy or competitive vibes, making the selected classifications both fitting and comprehensive."
