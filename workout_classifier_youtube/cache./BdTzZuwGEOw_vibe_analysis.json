  "vibesExplanation": "The video title '20 Min Yoga Flow for Beginners' and description indicate a gentle, beginner-friendly yoga sequence. The use of 'flow' suggests continuity and breath-centered movement, which aligns well with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The phrase 'best for people who are new to yoga' and comments like 'I felt so amazing afterwards' and 'perfect for those who have never stepped on a mat' further corroborate this vibe, emphasizing a grounding and intentional practice suitable for newcomers. \"Zen Flow\" is the best fit with a score of 0.9 due to the video's focus on a calming, slow-paced practice.\n\nThe secondary vibe identified is 'The Reboot Workout' due to the video\u2019s length and user comments mentioning stress relief and improved sleep, hinting at a refresh and relaxation aspect. The comment about helping someone with sleep issues reinforces the idea that this routine is not just for exercise, but also for mental and physical refreshment, giving it a score of 0.7. Other vibes like 'The Comfort Moves' were considered but less applicable since the workout still demands a typical yoga mat practice."
