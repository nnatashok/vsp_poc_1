  "spiritsExplanation": "The video focuses on 'guided breathwork' and integrates methods like the Wim Hof Method, physiological sighing, and mindfulness meditation, clearly pointing towards a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as these practices aim at relaxation, stress reduction, and recovery. This is further supported by user comments describing the workout as 'relaxing,' 'effective,' with 'calming instructions,' and comments about 'the stress just falls away' and 'joy' indicate strong restorative qualities. The blending of different techniques suggests a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, as the workout emphasizes seamless integration of various breath techniques and mindfulness in a continuous pattern, backed by user comments mentioning 'calming instructions' and 'profound mindfulness,' supporting this spirit. Given the consistent focus on breathwork rather than intense physical movement, there is little evidence supporting other spirits. Therefore, strong confidence is placed in 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.9 and 'Flow & Rhythm' at 0.7."
