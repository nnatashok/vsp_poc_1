  "vibesExplanation": "The video is titled 'Elliptical Workout in 15 min,' indicating a short, approachable session. The description refers to the workout as 'easy' and suitable for any level, which aligns with a restorative or refreshing theme, fitting 'The Reboot Workout' vibe for gentle post-activity movement or active recovery. Presence of the phrase 'a little movement will do your body good' and user comments mentioning its use as a warm-up or easing back into exercise further support this classification with a score of 0.75, suggesting a strong match.\n\nAdditionally, there is an element of 'The Endorphin Wave' since users mentioned feeling good and setting personal records during and post-workout. The mention of enjoying beach visualizations signals a feel-good, positive experience. These aspects, however, are less pronounced compared to the refreshing vibe, thus a moderate score of 0.5 is given."
