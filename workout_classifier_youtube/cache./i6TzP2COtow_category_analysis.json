  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary focus of this workout video, as indicated by the title '15 MIN FULL BODY STRETCH - Improve Mobility and Flexibility', tags like 'Stretch routine' and 'Increase mobility', and the description emphasizing a 'full body smooth stretch routine', is on stretching. These elements clearly align with the 'Stretching' category, warranting a high confidence score and a strong emphasis score of 1.\n\nAdditionally, the workout is performed on a mat as suggested by the phrase 'use a mat for extra comfort', and the absence of any equipment points towards general mat exercises. This justifies a secondary category of 'Mat' with a moderate presence score of 0.5. \n\nThe overall context, including community comments and app promotion, reinforces the workout's emphasis on flexibility and relaxation, further eliminating categories like HIIT or weight training. There is strong evidence for the selected categories, supported by explicit mentions in the metadata."
