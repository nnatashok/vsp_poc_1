  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video described is a guided meditation focusing on mindfulness and concentration enhancement. This type of workout typically does not require any physical equipment, as it primarily involves mental training and breathing exercises. The title, description, and tags all emphasize meditation, focus, and mindfulness, with no mention of physical activity or exercise equipment. Meditation is generally done seated or lying down, often on a mat for comfort, but since the video and description do not specify a mat or any other equipment, it can be considered bodyweight only, requiring no special equipment."
