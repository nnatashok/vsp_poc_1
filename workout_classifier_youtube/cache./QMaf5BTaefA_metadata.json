    "These short but killer rides are the BEST for motivation and pushing to my limits! At the end I\u2019m somehow ready for round 2 \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25",
    "Wow I just finished this 15 workout. Being a husband and dad of 3 this is awesome for quick, challenging workout. Thank you much.",
    "I started training with you guys 6 weeks ago. I had been going back to the 15 minute beginner session around once a week but upping my effort for a quick burn. This is now the session I will be using instead.<br><br>And also, thanks! I was seriously unfit and overweight. I am still overweight but am shedding weight, replacing fat with muscle, and am fitter than I&#39;ve been in years.",
