  "spiritsExplanation": "The video titled 'Powerful Guided Meditation for Healing & Letting Go \ud83e\udd0d' is best classified under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The description and tags emphasize healing, relaxation, and emotional wellness, with phrases like 'inner peace,' 'healing meditation,' and 'guided meditation for positive energy.' These indicate a focus on recovery and stress reduction. The channel, Lavendaire, consistently promotes self-development and healing techniques, further aligning with the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The top comments reflect personal healing experiences and emotional release, resonating with the purpose of restorative practices. Given the consistent emphasis on gentle recovery and emotional healing, the confidence level in this classification is very high, though the physical workout elements of other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are clearly irrelevant and excluded from consideration."
