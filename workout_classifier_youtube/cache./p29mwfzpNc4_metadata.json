    "Thank you. I am going through the worst time in my life. Cancer. Loss of job. Loss of relationship. Yet every morning I am at the beach listening to your gifts of love.",
    "To whoever is reading this: Sending love and hugs to all of you. Remember that you are loved. You are not alone in fighting your battles. We are here for you and we love you. The universe got your back. Trust in the divine process of life. You will definitely find peace, strength, love, and happiness. Stay safe \u2764\ufe0f",
    "Scrolled down to leave a comment about my experiences during this meditation, and it&#39;s heartening to read many others were touched by it as well. Had tears rolling down my cheeks when you said to imagine my parents next to me. My dad died a few months ago and I miss him very much. It was nice to just sit and feel his warmth surrounding me, even though he is no longer here. Thank you for this wonderful experience &lt;3",
    "Such a beautiful meditation experience. I\u2019m currently water fasting and needed something to help me stay relaxed and focused. May God bless you and your family. To anyone reading\u2026 May God send nothing but great things your way. \u2665\ufe0f\u2728\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc Thank you!"
