    "I wrote this book for you. To give you a detailed snapshot of how hypnotherapy can help you release many of your dream-life blocks like guilt, shame, trauma symptoms, anxiety, self-doubt, or fear-related silence. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4g6Omyh\">https://amzn.to/4g6Omyh</a>",

    "With every breath, the old moment is lost; a new moment arrives. <a href=\"http://manifestation.guide/\">manifestation.guide</a> We exhale and we let go of the old moment. It is lost to us. In doing so, we let go of the person we used to be. We inhale and breathe in the moment that is becoming. In doing so, we welcome the person we are becoming. We repeat the process. This is meditation. This is renewal. This is life.",
