  "description": "When we take time to deepen the relationship with our subtle body and breath, we are creating a sense of wholeness, of feeling complete, more true. \n\nThis can then lead to us feeling more confident and more capable of loving ourselves. \n\nAnd that of course can have a beautiful ripple effect, a movement beyond ourselves. \n\nSo as we begin to add more vocabulary and depth through visualization and imagination remember, \n\nHow you move matters. \n\nVisit the community tab to read today\u2019s full daily message + poem: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/yogawithadriene/community\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\ud83d\udda4 MOVE - Downloadable Collection \ud83e\udd0d\nhttps://ywa.co/MOVE\nBased on requests from the community, we are excited to announce a downloadable version of MOVE.

    "What does it mean to deepen your practice?",
    "Something she said on day 2 that has stuck with me and really drives me to return every day: &quot;The brain will give up before the body does.&quot;",
    "When Adriene spots the cardinals, she shows us how little moments of observation of nature can be pure joy.",
    "&quot;Your choice in how to end the practice...&quot; Am I the only one who was like, &quot;Wait, what...?&quot; Lol <br>I feel like I was so enveloped in today&#39;s practice and that no time had passed at all.<br>Many thanks for such a beautiful flow today, Adriene. A true gift.<br>It&#39;s only been five days of practice for me, but I can already tell a difference in my movement on the mat - there&#39;s a new, but welcome, lightness and a gentleness that I hope I can find off the mat sometime soon, too.<br>Happy to be here w. you all &lt;3<br>xx Shel",
    "For anyone who&#39;s behind on the practice I just wanted to say, it&#39;s never too late. You can always choose to show up for yourself &lt;3 Thank you Adriene, Namaste."
