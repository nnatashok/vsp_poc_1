  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata from the video titled 'Intense Lower Abs Workout | Tabata Workout to Burn Lower Belly Fat | growwithjo' explicitly states 'No Equipment' under the description. This indicates that the workout is designed to be performed without any additional equipment. Additionally, phrases such as 'All standing', 'Low Impact', and 'Beginner Friendly' suggest a format that relies on bodyweight exercises. The tags and descriptions reinforce the absence of equipment by emphasizing the accessibility and simplicity of the workout, intended for home execution even in small spaces. Furthermore, none of the user comments or tags mention any specific equipment use or need, supporting the conclusion of a bodyweight-only workout. Hence, the confidence level is very high that no equipment is required for this workout, justifying an empty requiredEquipment array."
