  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "This workout video is part of the \"Stronger Together Series\" and explicitly highlights that no equipment is needed, as indicated by the title \"no repeat, no equipment.\" The description further reinforces this by mentioning that it is a bodyweight workout. Tags such as \"no equipment workout,\" \"bodyweight workout,\" and \"hiit without weights\" emphasize that participants do not require any equipment to perform this workout. This is supported by the channel's focus on home workouts that often involve little to no equipment, encouraging accessibility. Therefore, the workout appears to be solely bodyweight-based, requiring no additional equipment to perform."
