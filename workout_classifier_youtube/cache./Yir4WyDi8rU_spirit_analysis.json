  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the workout video is 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.85. This is justified by the use of energetic and fast-paced music at 135-160 BPM, which aligns with descriptors like 'heart-pumping' and 'sweat-dripping' in high-energy workouts. The title and comments, such as 'run 45 mins non-stop' and 'the mix has been getting me through workouts,' suggest the music is used to maintain an intense running pace, a hallmark of high-energy sessions.\n\nAdditionally, the spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm' is also strongly present with a score of 0.75. The continuous music mix that is coordinated with movement (running) emphasizes a mind-body connection and rhythm, as reflected in the description's note of the mix being 'perfect for advanced runners who run at higher tempo.' The music-driven pacing supports coordinated running patterns.\n\nOther spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were not chosen due to a lack of indicators for methodical training plans or relaxation focus respectively. The absence of environmental elements rules out 'Outdoor & Adventure.'"
