  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is heavily focused on breathing techniques, as evidenced by the title 'Guided Daily Breathwork Routine' and numerous references in the tags such as 'breathwork meditation,' 'pranayama breathing,' and 'happy breathing exercises.' This aligns with the 'Breathing exercises' category, which I have assigned a high score of 0.9 due to the central role of breathwork in the session.\n\nThe video also aligns with the 'Meditation' category, given the emphasis on mindfulness and self-discovery as mentioned in the description ('heightened awareness,' 'self-discovery') and tags ('positivity meditation,' 'stress relief meditation'). This supports a secondary category as 'Meditation' with a score of 0.7, as the video promotes a mental state associated with meditation practices. \n\nThe focus on rhythmic music and emotional release further complements this categorization. Other categories, such as 'Yoga', are less applicable as there is no mention of physical poses or sequences typical of yoga. The combination of breathing and mental focus leans more towards meditation-associated benefits."
