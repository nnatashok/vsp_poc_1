    "Can we please take a moment and appreciate the fact that this man excercises and talks non stop and secondly he&#39;s an amazing trainer? He doesn&#39;t just point out how easy this workout is. He mentions we should pause whenever we need it and he keeps encouraging! Amazing person! So positive! Stay safe man!",
    "I\u2019m starting my weight loss journey, probably for the 1,000 time. It took me 3 days to get through whole video. I felt so encouraged throughout the whole video. When I finished my 30 mins I got so emotional because I made it! I started looking at other videos and it is truly my speed for my life style. Thanks for all the encouragement and for keeping it real!",
    "Tonight I was a bit depressed about having pcos and not being able to lose weight,I was about to go get some fast food and emotionally eat but I decided to exercise instead I don&#39;t regret my decision,thank you for being that motivation I cried with the end song and I feel great now.",
    "He&#39;s tired and breathes hard, other instructors will be like &quot;Wow my heart has stopped beating and my muscles are torn but I LOOOOVE IT&quot;.  I love how realistic the instructor is.",
    "real people, real emotions and limitations, god this is nice when your instructor gets tired too. <br>These type of exercises is what we need in these times, self isolation is time for self development"
