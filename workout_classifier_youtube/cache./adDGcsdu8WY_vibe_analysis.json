  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled '20 MIN CALORIE KILLER HIIT WORKOUT - Full body Cardio, No Equipment, No Repeat' strongly aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe, scoring 0.8. This is supported by descriptors like 'calorie killer' and 'HIIT', which imply high intensity and a sweat-dripping, heart-pounding session, characteristic of warrior-like energy. The 45s work intervals suggest a rigorous pace reinforcing this vibe.\n\nThe 'Firestarter' vibe is also relevant, scoring 0.7. This is due to the workout's explosiveness, indicated by 'HIIT' and '20 min' duration, suggesting a session that is fast and devastating, fitting the description of a Firestarter workout.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' scores 0.6. The comments section reveals user feedback indicating significant long-term progress ('lost fat and gained better body composition'), which implies a steady build of energy and improvement over time, suggesting a positive endorphin effect.\n\nThe inclusion of intervals (45s on / 15s rest) supports a structured intensity that fits these vibes, and no other potential vibes strongly fit this workout type."
