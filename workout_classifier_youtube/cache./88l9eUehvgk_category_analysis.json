  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Treadmill,' with a high score of 0.95. This is explicitly indicated by the repeated references to 'treadmill' in the title, tags, and description, such as '15-Minute Walk-Run Intervals | Follow Along Treadmill Workout!' and tags like 'treadmill workout,' 'follow along treadmill workout.' The emphasis on 'walk-run intervals' also solidifies the treadmill focus.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Running,' with a score of 0.7. This is because the video involves running segments as part of the interval training, indicated by phrases like 'run and recovery intervals' and comments about pushing running speeds.\n\nThe third category, 'Walking,' receives a score of 0.6. The workout includes walking as part of the interval training, evidenced by the description 'seamlessly blending walking and running' and tags such as '15 minute treadmill walk' and 'calorie burn walking workout.'\n\nOther categories like 'HIIT' or 'Mat' were not applicable as the workout does not focus on intense interval training typical of HIIT nor on exercises done on a mat. The confidence level is very high due to clear alignment with the metadata and channel focus on treadmill and running workouts."
