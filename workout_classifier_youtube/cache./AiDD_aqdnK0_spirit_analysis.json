  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to several explicit indicators in the metadata: 'HIIT' in the title and tags stands for 'High-Intensity Interval Training,' known for its demanding nature. The description emphasizes physical intensity, and phrases like 'improve your fitness,' 'sweating buckets,' and 'if you're not sweating buckets at the end, you're not doing it right' directly convey the high-energy nature. Comments from viewers describing the workout as 'intense' and 'brutal' at the 20-minute mark also confirm the energetic intensity, justifying a 0.9 score.\n\n'Sport & Agility' is also applicable, evidenced by the context of 'Cycle Training' and 'Pro cycling' as tags and the channel's focus on cycling. The session is designed to emulate 'climbing big hills,' aligning with endurance and agility aspects essential to sports training. Given the channel's reputation for cycling content and training specificity, this spirit is strong but secondary, warranting a 0.7 score. Other spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are not applicable due to lack of relevant indicators."
