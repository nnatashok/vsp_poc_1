  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout combines Pilates principles with cardio elements, requiring some coordination and balance. While basic Pilates movements can be beginner-friendly, the combination with cardio flows and optional weights suggests a more intermediate level. The instructor's background in dance might imply a focus on form and technique, adding complexity. The use of light weights also adds a layer of difficulty slightly beyond beginner movements. Comments suggest modifications are possible, allowing participants to handle various levels of difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 37 minutes long, incorporating cardio elements within a Pilates framework, indicating moderate to challenging effort, especially for deconditioned individuals. The use of light weights with cardio flow increases heart rate and energy expenditure. While comments indicate options to modify intensity (e.g., low-impact versions), maintaining an elevated heart rate throughout suggests effort beyond 'Light'. Descriptors like 'sweaty session' and 'really enjoy' further support the moderate to challenging classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the intermediate technique difficulty with some advanced elements, along with moderate to challenging effort level due to duration and cardio integration, this workout primarily suits intermediate participants. However, there are elements accessible to beginners seeking a challenge, especially with modifications available (as mentioned in comments). The option to forego weights and modify movements, combined with a welcoming and adaptable teaching style, accommodates beginners who are ready to progress. The workout's structure also aligns well with advanced users looking for a lighter or recovery day session. Thus, the classification spans multiple fitness levels to include a broad audience."
