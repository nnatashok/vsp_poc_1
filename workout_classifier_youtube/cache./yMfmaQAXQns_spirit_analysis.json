  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a very high score of 0.95. This is supported by the title which clearly mentions 'High Intensity CALORIE TORCHER.' The description reinforces this with phrases like 'Torch FAT & SCULPT,' '30 Min High-Intensity Spin\u00ae Class,' and 'INTENSE Spin and indoor cycling workout.' The use of terms such as 'hills, Sprints, & Jumps' further indicates a vigorous and challenging workout session.\n\nSecondly, the workout exhibits elements of 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.7, given that it incorporates specific cycling routines like hills, sprints, and jumps, suggesting a methodical session with a clear format. The comments also reflect discipline, with users noting repeated engagement and significant physical transformations through structured routines ('doing this routine every day' and losing weight from '104.500kgs to 86.000kgs').\n\nOther spirits were not applicable, as the workout focuses on high-intensity indoor cycling rather than mind-body flow, outdoor settings, or restorative yoga-like elements."
