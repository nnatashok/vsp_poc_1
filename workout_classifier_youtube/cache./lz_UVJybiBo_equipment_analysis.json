  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Guided Meditation For Positive Vibrations | Gurudev' clearly focuses on meditation, as indicated by the title and repeatedly throughout the description and tags. Meditation is typically practiced as a seated activity, often requiring no specialized equipment unless optional props like a mat for comfort are preferred. However, there is no explicit mention of any equipment like a mat in this video's metadata. The description emphasizes the simplicity of the practice, suggesting that viewers only need to 'sit back, relax, and follow Gurudev's instructions,' reinforcing the bodyweight-only nature of this activity. Therefore, no equipment is required for this meditation session."
