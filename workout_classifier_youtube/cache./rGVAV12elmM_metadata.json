However to get fat loss results I recommend the following:\n1. Being in calorie deficit\n2. Cardio/ HIIT workout (I often call these Fat Loss/Burn workouts on my channel)\n3. Resistance training and specific muscle targeted workouts. To strengthen and develop specific muscles.\nI have hundreds of other home workouts available on my channel, so you can pick and choose which workouts you want to do, to not only make you build a strong body, but also feel amazing.\nPlease remember every body is different and we all progress at different rates. The fact that you have shown up and completed this workout is incredible. You should be very proud of yourself for taking the steps to improve not only your physical, but also your mental health.\nThe key to achieving your fitness and health goals is consistency and healthy lifestyle changes, without restriction. I don\u2019t believe in crazy fad diets. Simply eat nutritious food, move your body, smile and enjoy the journey! Love Lilly",

    "As a gym bro that lifts heavy while doing insane calisthenics for up to 2 hours a day, this is great for my wife. <br>Remember folks, consistency is key even with a normal little 15 min workout like this. All you gotta do is do it everyday and stop drinking your calories. That\u2019s all, no big secret, get after it\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
