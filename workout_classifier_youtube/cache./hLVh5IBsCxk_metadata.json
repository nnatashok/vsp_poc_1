    "I once read a comment that said that it didn&#39;t matter if you took longer breaks or had to stop sometimes, still you are better than those who are sitting on the couch doing nothing.",
    "Been so overwhelmed with grief put off my workouts for 5 weeks. This was my first workout since losing 2 people I love. What you do matters. You made my bad day so much better today. Love you!",
    "To anyone who&#39;s reading this:<br>You are strong. You are beautiful. You are powerful. <br>Remind yourself that working out is not a punishment for what you ate, but a celebration of what your body can do!<br>I hope you have a fantastic day :))",
    "I first did this workout 2 days ago and had to take multiple breaks, feeling nauseous, and sobbing. I\u2019m so happy to report that I was able to complete this workout today with no breaks and no nausea with a smile on my face and in my heart. Never give up, we are all strong enough to push through! Thank you so much for this video!!"
