    "I love how calm her workout videos are while I&#39;m crying doing it in my room",
    "That was my first go at a Pilates workout! It was pretty difficult for me as I don\u2019t have a lot of strength and am overweight but I tried to just go slow and focus on my breathing because I heard it\u2019s more about small controlled movements not how fast you can do them! Great workout!\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb",
    "Here&#39;s a tip:<br>When you feel like giving up, close your eye and just focus on the music (pretend to sleep, it helps)<br>BREATHE! Please remember to breathe! <br>It&#39;s ok to pause the video and take a break \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96",

DAY TEN DONE!<br>august 14: \u2718 started uni today and feel very tired. I will rest for today, and tomorrow I will be back with my routine\ud83d\ude0a<br>august 15: \u2713 rest day was amazing and today came back recharged, it felt so easy! im so happy. day 12 done!<br>august 16: \u2713 easyyy! day 13 done &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3<br>august 17: spend the day with friends playing just dance the entire afternoon so i didn&#39;t do my workout routine:( day 14 not done)<br>august 18: \u2713 started very early today! i woke up and went straight to do this 10 min vid. day 15 done!<br>august 19: \u2713 it felt really easy today, day 16 done\u2661\u2661\u2661<br>august 20: \u2713 DAY 17 DONE, i always feel so amazing after doing this video i looooove it\u2661<br>\u22c6\u02d9\u27e1\u2661 \u22c6\u02d9\u27e1\u2661 \u22c6\u02d9 UPDATE \u22c6\u02d9\u27e1\u2661 \u22c6\u02d9\u27e1\u2661 \u22c6\u02d9 the changes im seeing are mostly in my waist(getting smaller) cause for me everytime i start doing a workout is the same( i start with my stomach getting smaller MOST than my legs and other body parts). but the thing i love the most is that i feel with more energy through the day, i can move better (like walk faster or longer without getting tired). but like i said before, im not only doing this 10min video alone. im complimenting with 20minutes of elliptical and some weight machines for my arms. I noticed that im losing size but not weight.. (even tho im fasting since 7pm to 9am). \u22c6\u02d9\u27e1\u2661 \u22c6\u02d9\u27e1\u2661\u22c6\u02d9 UPDATE \u22c6\u02d9\u27e1\u2661 \u22c6\u02d9\u27e1\u2661 \u22c6\u02d9<br>august 21: \u2718 day 18 not done :(<br>august 22: \u2713 DAY 19 DONE! i&#39;ve been SO BUSY with uni, yesterday all day, (literally the entire day so i got pretty tired). today mostly afternoon but wouldn&#39;t let pass another day without working out, is so fun now, it makes me feel like a brand new person physically and mentally \u2661\u2661\u2661<br>august 23: \u2713 Day 20 doneeee! \u2661<br>august 24: \u2713 Day 21 done \ud83d\ude0astarted early today\u2661<br>august 25: \u2718 Day 22 not done, i&#39;ve been asked to participate in two amazing little projects!

(heeello, today is saturday, and it&#39;s been a whole week... last saturday i went hiking and i ended up complaining the entire week cause my entire body was hurting, i never would&#39;ve thought that it was going to be so bad hahaha. still want to keep hiking, it was a pretty intense first time but i loved it!)\r<br>February 18 : \u2718<br>February 19 : \u2718<br>February 20 : \u2718<br>February 21 : \u2718<br>February 22 : \u2713<br>February 23 : \u2718<br>February 24 : \u2713<br>February 25 : \u2718<br>February 26 : \u2713<br>February 27 : \u2713<br>February 28 : \u2718<br>February 29 : \u2718<br><br>March 1: \u2718<br>March 2: \u2718<br>March 3: \u2718<br>March 4: \u2713<br>March 5: \u2713<br><br>April 22: \u2713 hi everyoneee im back! \ud83e\udd0d<br>April 23: \u2718<br>April 24: \u2713<br><br>November 20: \u2713<br>November 21: \u2713<br>November 22: \u2713<br>November 23: \u2713<br>November 24: \u2713<br>November 25: \u2713<br>November 26: \u2718<br>November 27: \u2713<br>November 28: \u2713<br>November 29: \u2718<br>November 30: \u2713<br>December 1: \u2713<br>December 2: \u2718<br>December 3: \u2713<br><br>November 22, 2024.<br>I haven&#39;t had the motivation to share my process, i guess that all this attention is a little overwhelming so that&#39;s why i stopped giving updates even tho i have come back to this video like I&#39;ve had said it before...<br>But no one knows me so it really shouldn&#39;t affect that much..<br>truth is, starting the month of april i went to therapy for the first time in my life, i thought that i was doing so much work and then some other stuff happened in my life so i had to stop going, bc i don&#39;t want to be a burden. I have learned so much this year, is been harsh. I&#39;ll try to keep up with updates cause it used to make me happy, specially connecting and helping with you!<br><br>hey! is a new year\ud83c\udf89 i haven&#39;t updated you, but i started in january 2025 again!!<br>i did two weeks and the i stopped, so i began all over again in february<br><br>Just wanted to say that i always come back to this video cause when i started doing this routine i noticed that for the first time in my life.. finally found something that helped me losing weight.<br>That&#39;s why all of the updates. And with consistency my body changed a lot (aug-sept 2023). this past months i haven&#39;t been that consistent but still has helped to make me feel comfortable in my own skin. <br><br>thank u to every person that is leaving me comments, you all are so sweet \ud83d\udc97 makes me want to keep going! \ud83d\udc97<br><br>if u want to ask me anything about this beautiful process, here is my instagram\u2b50@michuuuh\u2b50"
