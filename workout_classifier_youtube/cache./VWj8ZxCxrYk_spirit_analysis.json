  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' (0.6) due to the cardio-focused nature of the session and user comments describing significant physical exertion, such as 'my whole body is burning' and 'my legs are shaking'. Despite being designed for beginners, these comments suggest a vigorous activity level. The spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm' (0.5) is present, inferred from the non-stop format of the workout and the description emphasizing continuous basic exercises. This implies a sustained tempo, aligning with a rhythmic flow, especially since it is a cardio routine. 'Structured & Disciplined' (0.55) is reflected in the orderly design of the workout aimed at beginners, suggesting a planned and methodical approach to build endurance progressively, as seen in comments describing improvement over days. 'Soothing & Restorative' was excluded due to the focus on cardio intensity, while 'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are irrelevant given the indoor and non-sport-specific nature of the workout."
