  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is classified under 'The Firestarter' due to the intense pyramid style HIIT cardio, which involves explosive and speed variations with sprints and climbs suggested by phrases like 'fast, slow, fast structure'. The energetic playlist and the calls to increase resistance further contribute to this vibe, indicating a strong yet brief burst of intensity (score: 0.75).\n\n'Endorphin Wave' is relevant as the workout facilitates steady caloric burn and a sustained aerobic effort over 40 minutes, aligning with descriptions of boosting metabolism and burning calories, supported by user comments about feeling sweaty and satisfied (score: 0.7).\n\nFinally, 'The Warrior Workout' emerges, emphasizing the challenging nature of the session with a focus on resistance increases to push physical limits, confirmed by the channel's goal to help people 'SPRINT THROUGH THE STORM' and comments indicating the intense, sweat-inducing effort required (score: 0.65). The ambiguity in selecting this vibe arises from its intensity, not typical for every warrior workout, hence a lower score."
