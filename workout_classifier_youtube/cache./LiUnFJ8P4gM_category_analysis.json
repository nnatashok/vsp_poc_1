  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is strongly categorized as 'Breathing exercises' due to the explicit focus on the 4-7-8 breathing technique, as stated in the title and supported by tags such as '10 minute 478 breathing', '4-7-8 breathing technique', and 'anxity relief breathing'. The description emphasizes the use of this breathing pattern for relaxation and anxiety relief, which aligns it entirely with breathing exercises.\nThe 'Meditation' category is also relevant, but to a lesser extent, with a score of 0.6. This is due to mentions of this breathing technique being part of meditation practices and the channel's focus on meditation in general. The tags and description references mentioning 'mindful breathing meditation' and 'pranayama exercise' suggest a connection to meditative practices, which further justifies this secondary category.\nOther categories, such as 'Yoga,' were considered due to the association with pranayama, but there was insufficient evidence directly linking this specific practice to a yoga session."
