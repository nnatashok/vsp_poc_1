  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for this Tabata ab workout is rated between Beginner (0.4) and Intermediate (0.7). The exercises do not require equipment and focus on core strengthening, which is typically straightforward, involving exercises like crunches or planks. However, the use of Tabata timing, where exercises need to be performed with correct form under a timer, introduces an element of moderate complexity, thus warranting an Intermediate score as well. The description advises listening to your body and adjusting as necessary, making it accessible to those with varied experiences.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is considered between Moderate (0.7) and Challenging (0.6) due to the high-intensity nature of Tabata training and the 15-minute duration requiring consecutive 20-second bursts followed by 10 seconds of rest. The low-impact nature mentioned in the title suggests it can be manageable for less active individuals, but the intensity of continuous core engagement can be demanding. User comments also reflect varying levels of fitness managing this workout, indicating it may be quite demanding for beginners.",
