  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative', supported by strong indicators throughout the metadata. The title mentions 'Calm Breathing Exercise' and 'Deep Relaxation', emphasizing relaxation and stress relief. The description elaborates on the calming benefits, aiming to alleviate anxiety and promote sleep. The tags further reinforce this with phrases like 'relieve stress', 'anxiety relief', and 'to relax or fall asleep'. The channel's focus on meditation and simple relaxation practices aligns perfectly with this spirit, resulting in a high confidence score of 0.95.\n\nA secondary spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' is reflected in the use of the rhythmic 4-7-8 breathing technique, which aligns with mindful flow and controlled breathing patterns, justifying a moderate score of 0.45. However, the primary emphasis on relaxation denotes a stronger alignment with the restorative spirit. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are clearly inapplicable due to the lack of intensity or sports-specific elements."
