  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title and description emphasize a relaxing stretching routine suitable for bedtime. The description specifically mentions using a 'mat, a soft rug, or even your bed,' which implies a preference but not a necessity for a mat. The mat is suggested for optimal comfort and support during the stretches, aligning with common practice in stretch routines aimed at better sleep and relaxation. The confidence score is 0.7, indicating high confidence as the mat is mentioned as an option where the workout can be performed, but not strictly required since alternatives like a rug or bed are also viable."
