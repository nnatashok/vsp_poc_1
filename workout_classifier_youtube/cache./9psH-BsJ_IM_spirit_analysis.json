  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is described as a 'Beginner Zone 2 Cardio Workout' targeting heart rate maintenance and fat burning over 20 minutes, suggesting a focus on rhythm and sustained effort, characteristic of the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The structure, involving a warm-up, repeated exercises, and a cool-down, aligns with 'Structured & Disciplined' since it follows a methodical routine designed to progressively build cardio endurance. Comments mentioning ease of following and its non-intimidating nature reinforce this. The spirit of 'Soothing & Restorative' is present but less dominant, as the low-impact elements and user feedback about positivity and anxiety reduction suggest a calming influence, though not the primary focus. 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are less applicable due to the moderate, beginner-friendly intensity and lack of focus on sports skills. Therefore, a 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' combination is most fitting, with a minor 'Soothing & Restorative' aspect."
