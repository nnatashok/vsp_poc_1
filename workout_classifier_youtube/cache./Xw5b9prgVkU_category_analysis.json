  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Weight workout' with a very high score of 0.9. This is because the video focuses on a 'Full Body Workout with Dumbbells,' as stated repeatedly in the title, tags, and description. The use of various dumbbells (5kg to 17.5kg) for exercises such as tricep overhead extension, curl and press, and renegade rows supports this classification strongly.\n\nThe secondary category, 'HIIT,' is assigned a score of 0.7. The workout incorporates high-intensity elements, evidenced by a structured pattern of 60 seconds of activity with 10 seconds of rest, characteristic of HIIT style, and further supported by the metadata tags mentioning 'hiit workout.'\n\nA potential third category is 'Body weight' with a score of 0.4. Although the primary focus is using dumbbells, some exercises like push-ups and goblet squat involve bodyweight movements evident in the exercise list. However, this is less central compared to the other two categories.\n\nThe evident structured use of dumbbells and high-intensity intervals substantiates the classification, while the presence of bodyweight exercises is notable but secondary."
