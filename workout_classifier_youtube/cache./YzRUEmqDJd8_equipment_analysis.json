  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'GUIDED MEDITATION for Healing Anxiety, PTSD, Panic & Stress' is a meditation video focused on mental relaxation and healing, which typically does not require any physical exercise equipment. The description and tags emphasize guided meditation, diaphragmatic breathing, and relaxation techniques, all of which are consistent with a bodyweight or non-physical-activity-based approach. No equipment is explicitly mentioned or implied, and the emphasis is on audio guidance and visualization rather than any physical exercises. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, with no specific equipment required for participation."
