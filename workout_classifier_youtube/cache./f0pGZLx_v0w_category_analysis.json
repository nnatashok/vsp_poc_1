  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is clearly centered on breathwork, as indicated by the title \"Guided Hormesis Breathing: Reset Your Nervous System\" and reiterated in the description, which emphasizes courses and tips on breathwork. The channel description and video comments further support this, with references to breathwork and mindfulness techniques. This leads to a high confidence level (0.95) for categorizing it as 'Breathing exercises' with a score of 1.0, indicating this is the primary focus of the video.\n\nAdditionally, the video may incorporate elements of 'Meditation', as suggested by its calming intent and the effect it has on viewers' mental states, such as reducing anxiety and promoting positive thoughts, as noted in comments. However, since the main focus is on breathing rather than meditation techniques or mindfulness practices, it is scored slightly lower at 0.7.\n\nOther categories like 'Yoga', 'Stretching', or 'Body weight' are excluded as there is no indication of physical exercise or body movement beyond breath-focused practices."
