  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this video is 'Soothing & Restorative', which scored 0.95 due to explicit indicators in the title and description. The title mentions 'Full Body Stretch Routine' that is 'Beginner Friendly', while the description focuses on relaxation, flexibility, and mobility with phrases like 'Relax with me', 'loosening up tight muscles', and 'great for flexibility and mobility'. These descriptors are consistent with a restorative session aimed at recovery and relaxation.\n\nAdditionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is a secondary spirit with a score of 0.6. This is inferred from the smooth, continuous movements typical of stretching routines which facilitate a mind-body connection, though not as prominently as a purely rhythmic workout. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are not relevant here due to the absence of intensity and specific technical structure. Instead, the user comments confirm the routine's restorative nature, with mentions of it being a 'warm up', 'progress', and 'great start', reflecting a gentle and accommodating approach rather than exertion."
