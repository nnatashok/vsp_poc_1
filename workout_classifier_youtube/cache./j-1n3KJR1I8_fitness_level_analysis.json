  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for this breathing exercise is rated as 'Beginner' with a score of 1 due to the simplicity of executing a 4-7-8 breathing pattern. This technique involves inhaling, holding, and exhaling for specific counts, which requires minimal coordination and is suitable for individuals without prior experience in breathwork. An 'Intermediate' level scores 0.2 due to the slight complexity of maintaining focus and control over the timing of breaths, which might present a moderate challenge for some users unfamiliar with timed breathing patterns.",

  ],
  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.95,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is evaluated as 'Light' due to the inherently low physical demands of the exercise. Breathing exercises such as the 4-7-8 technique are designed to be calming and require minimal physical exertion, focusing primarily on relaxation and mindfulness rather than energy expenditure. The 5:41 duration of the video suggests a short, focused session that is unlikely to be physically taxing, further supporting this classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner', scoring 1, given the simple and low-effort nature of the breathing exercises. This is reinforced by the video's intent to help relax or fall asleep, making it accessible to users new to exercise or with low fitness levels. An 'Intermediate' level scores 0.4 because some users may initially find the timing and focus required for controlled breathing slightly challenging, particularly if they struggle with anxiety or other conditions impacting concentration. Nonetheless, the breathing exercise is accessible to most fitness levels, allowing those with some mindfulness experience to engage easily."
