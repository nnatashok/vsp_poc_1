  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"11 Best Standing Exercises (No Jumping) To Lose Weight At Home\" clearly emphasizes \"standing exercises\" and \"no jumping,\" indicating a focus on bodyweight exercises that are low impact. The description mentions \"body-weight exercises\" specifically, which suggests no additional equipment is necessary. The tags reiterate this by emphasizing \"home workout,\" \"low impact workout,\" and \"workout without jumping,\" supporting the idea that no equipment is required. The comments list exercises like knee raises, arm circles, and side bends, which can all be done without any equipment. Furthermore, the channel description states that workouts require \"no equipment or gym.\" Given this substantial evidence, it's clear the workout is designed to be bodyweight only, thus requiring no equipment."
