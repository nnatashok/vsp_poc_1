  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit assigned is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.95 due to multiple indicators of the workout's emphasis on relaxation and stress relief, especially at bedtime. This is evidenced by the video title ('Relaxing Routine before Sleep'), descriptions ('feeling relaxed and rejuvenated', 'promoting restful sleep'), and comments praising its stress-relieving qualities. The tags such as 'relaxing stretches', 'stretches for better sleep', and 'stretches to do before bed' further reinforce this classification. The secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm', receives a moderate score of 0.5. While there are no direct references to musical or rhythmic elements in the title or description, a comment mentioning 'the music you chose for this video is just delightful' suggests a possible flow quality. However, the overall soothing intention remains dominant, hence a lower score for 'Flow & Rhythm'. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are not applicable due to the low-intensity focus of this routine."
