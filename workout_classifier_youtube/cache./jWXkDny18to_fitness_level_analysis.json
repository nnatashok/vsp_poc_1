  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercise involves guided breathing techniques, suitable for beginners due to the simplicity of breath holds and meditation. Evidence from tags indicates these are 'relaxation' and 'guided meditation' exercises, which are basic in nature. However, intermediate users may gain more from nuanced breathing patterns, as evidenced by comments on enjoyment of breath retentions and the 1-minute holds that require some focus.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves breath holds and relaxation techniques that are characterized by low energy expenditure. Comments express ease in practice ('addicted to breath retentions'), indicating a low-demand activity. Tags repeat themes of relaxation and meditation, further supporting Light difficulty. Some Moderate effort is possible due to the 1-minute retention, but this is minimal for general fitness.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the low technique and effort requirements, this workout is highly suitable for beginners. This is supported by the lining of breathwork with relaxation and meditation cues aimed at novices to breath techniques. However, the 1-minute breath holds offer marginal increased challenge, benefiting intermediate-level participants who desire more focused practice, as suggested by user comments on retention addiction and tags like 'pranayama' which indicates some minor complexity."
