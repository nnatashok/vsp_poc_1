  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Breathing exercises,' as evidenced by the video title 'Breathwork for Deep and Restful Sleep - Simple Breathing Exercise to Help You Relax', which explicitly refers to 'breathwork' and 'breathing exercises'. The description further reinforces this classification with phrases like 'guided breathwork practice', 'deeply soothing and conscious connected breaths', and 'restful and better night's sleep', making it clear that the core of the video is centered around breathing techniques for relaxation and sleep improvement. The high viewership and positive comments about using the video for better sleep underscore its effectiveness as a breathwork routine. Therefore, it receives a high confidence level of 1.0.\n\nThe secondary category, 'Meditation', is included with a moderate score of 0.5, due to the use of meditation-related terms like 'conscious', 'mindful', and 'shift gears' in the description and the fact that breathwork can overlap with meditation practices, especially in contexts aimed at relaxation and mental calmness. However, since the primary focus is on the physicality of breath techniques rather than meditation itself, the score here is lower. The comments do not directly reference meditation, which further justifies the lower score."
