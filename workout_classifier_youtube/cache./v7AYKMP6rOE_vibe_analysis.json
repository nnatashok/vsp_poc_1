  "vibesExplanation": "The main vibe identified in this workout video is \"The Zen Flow,\" scoring a 0.9. This is based on the title and description which emphasize a mindful approach (\"stay mindful and find what feels good\"), suitable for complete beginners, highlighting a non-intense, grounding, and intentional practice typical of yoga. The video's accessibility and encouragement of on-the-mat exploration align well with \"The Zen Flow.\" \"The Reboot Workout\" scores 0.8, supported by comments and tags indicating a gentle, restorative experience, with users feeling emotionally and physically rejuvenated (\"best 20 minutes of exercise,\" \"feel so good and so much better physically and emotionally\"). \"The Comfort Moves\" scores 0.7, reflecting the video's accommodating nature for a wide audience, including individuals with health challenges, as seen in comments (\"best exercise...after chemotherapy\"). While there are elements of relaxation and accessible movement, the focus is not solely on comfort, hence a lower score."
