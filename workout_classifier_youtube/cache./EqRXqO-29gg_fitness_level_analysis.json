  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is presented as a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session requiring no equipment, which typically implies the use of basic bodyweight exercises that do not demand complex technique. The use of planks as rest breaks suggests simple yet effective exercises. The tags include 'beginner workout at home' and 'calisthenics', indicating the involvement of straightforward movements, likely suitable for beginners to intermediate users.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled \"EXTREME FAT BURNING\" and involves a continuous 5-minute HIIT session with no breaks. This denotes a high-intensity workout designed to maximize energy expenditure in a short time period, suitable for 'beginners' only under the context of someone who can handle basic bodyweight movements at high intensity. Viewers describe it as intense and mention the fatigue ('planks as rest breaks'), confirming it requires significant effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the technique and effort difficulty assessments, the workout can be approached by beginners if they can handle intense cardio without breaks, though it's more suitable for those at an intermediate level of fitness who can cope with continuous movement. Advanced users may also find it beneficial as a quick, intense workout. The absence of complex movements allows for a broader range of fitness levels, but the intensity limits it slightly for complete beginners."
