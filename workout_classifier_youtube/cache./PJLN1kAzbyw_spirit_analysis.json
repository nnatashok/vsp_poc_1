  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is predominantly classified as \"Soothing & Restorative\" due to the emphasis on gentleness, relaxation, and mind-body connection, evident in the title 'Beginners Gentle Pilates Flow Mat Workout' and repeatedly mentioned throughout the video tags and description. The word 'gentle' appears multiple times, and the description emphasizes balance, centering, and a non-intensive approach, supporting this spirit with high confidence (score 0.9).\n\nThe \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit is next, as the term 'Flow' in both the title and tags suggests a focus on continuous, smooth movements, characteristic of Pilates routines. This is reinforced by channel content, which emphasizes a connection between mind and body through rhythmic movement, giving it a score of 0.85.\n\nA secondary classification of \"Structured & Disciplined\" is considered due to the technical precision required in Pilates and comments praising instructional clarity, though it is less dominant. The structured nature of Pilates and viewer comments on posture improvement suggest a score of 0.4.\n\nOther potential spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Outdoor & Adventure\" are not applicable due to a lack of intensity and an indoor setting."
