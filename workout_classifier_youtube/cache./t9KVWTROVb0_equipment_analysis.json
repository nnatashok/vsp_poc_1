  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly designed as a 'Beginner Elliptical Workout,' as stated in the video title and reinforced throughout the description and tags, which highlight phrases such as 'elliptical workout,' 'elliptical machine workout,' and 'sunny elliptical machine.' Furthermore, the description details the levels of resistance used during the workout on an elliptical machine. Additionally, the 'Fitness Equipment Used' section specifies the Smart Long Stride Advanced Electromagnetic Elliptical Machine, model SF-E3889SMART, further confirming the requirement. Therefore, there is very high confidence that an elliptical machine is necessary for this workout."
