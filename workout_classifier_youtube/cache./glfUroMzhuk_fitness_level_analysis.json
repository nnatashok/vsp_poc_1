  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout video is actually a meditation session, not a traditional physical workout. Meditation is typically low in complexity regarding physical movement and coordination. This session involves listening to a guided meditation and following mental instructions, emphasizing positive energy and manifestation, which does not require physical technique. Therefore, it is appropriate to classify the technique difficulty as 'Beginner' with high confidence, as it involves sitting or lying down without any specific physical movements.",
