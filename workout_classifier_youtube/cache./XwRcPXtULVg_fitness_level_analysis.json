  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises listed, such as bicep curls, lunges, push-ups, and deadlifts, are typical of an intermediate level workout. These exercises require some coordination and knowledge of proper form, especially since the video emphasizes form to maximize the workout. Rear delt flyes and Romanian deadlifts are included, which are more complex than beginner exercises due to their need for proper form and balance. Overall, while none of the exercises are excessively complex individually, the variety and focus on form suggest an intermediate technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves 20 exercises with a work-to-rest ratio of 45 seconds on / 20 seconds off, indicating a moderate level of effort. The duration of 26 minutes is moderately challenging, especially given the exercises involve compound movements with dumbbells, which increase the intensity. The format of no repeat exercises could allow for heavier weights, further increasing effort, but the moderate work/rest ratio makes it manageable. Description and comments suggest a challenging but not overwhelming effort level, suitable for moderately conditioned individuals.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the technique and effort difficulties, the workout targets mainly intermediate participants, but can also accommodate beginners who are ready for a challenge and advanced beginners. The inclusion of dumbbells allows users to choose weights that fit their current fitness level, making it accessible to a range of abilities. The workout's duration and no-repeat format also cater to more experienced exercisers, who might use heavier dumbbells or perform exercises with more explosiveness. This expansive range is reflected in user comments appreciating workout intensity and structure, which mentions how they appreciate the challenge and the ability to go heavier due to no repeats."
