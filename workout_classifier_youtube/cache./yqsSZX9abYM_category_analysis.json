  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under 'Weight workout' with a score of 0.8 due to the specific mention of 'dumbbell flies' and 'squat holds' in the comments, indicating resistance training using weights. The inclusion of a 'set of resistance cables' in the description further supports this classification. The category 'Body weight' is also relevant with a score of 0.6 as 'squat holds' are a bodyweight exercise, and the workout appears to be home-based, typical of bodyweight routines. The focus on PCOS and weight loss suggests these exercise types are chosen for their metabolic benefits. There is no direct evidence for other categories like cardio or flexibility exercises, thus they are excluded. High confidence is placed on this classification owing to the detailed indicators from comments and equipment mentioned in the description."
