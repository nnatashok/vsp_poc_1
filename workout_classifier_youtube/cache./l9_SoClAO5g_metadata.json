    "To anyone doing this workout . . . this workout is so good and you will see results!!  I did, and just  after a month of  doing it 4 times a week.   (combined with moderate to intense 10  minute walking), I could see results.    Please keep on doing it, no matter how difficult it sometimes get.  You deserve the  body <del>and muscles</del>  you are  trying  so hard to achieve.   Thank you, Caroline!!",
    "A workout does NOT need to take 2 hours, these no-repeat, quick workouts are great for us at the firehouse trying to find the time to get in a well balanced workout!",
    "Wow! I&#39;m a 47 year old Mum with 20 years of yoga but not much strength training under my belt. Realising how important strength is as I approach menopause. This was so doable and so very well set out. Love. Thank you so much. Will continue. \ud83d\ude4f",
    "Ive been doing this 2-3 times a week for 3 weeks, combined with 10-15 minutes of cardio and I can see the difference in my whole body my arms and back are getting stronger/smaller and toned and my apron belly is shrinking and my booty is getting lifted. I am using 20 pound dumbbells for reference. Also, I have been sleeping SO good since implementing this into my daily schedule. I work full time and have 2 kids so I barely have time for myself but I do this in the morning before getting ready for the day or on my lunch break at home and it is helping me tone like crazy. I hope this motivates someone to try it. Thank you so much Caroline, I look forward to trying to add your 10 minute weighted abs into my routine as well!",
    "Full body with weights and NO repeats are my absolutely favorite workouts! And it is 20 mins! Thank you so much for spoiling us here with your daily workouts in December!"
