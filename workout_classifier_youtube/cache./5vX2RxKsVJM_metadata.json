    "3 weeks ago I was only able to finish half of the video and I was out of breath. After 3 weeks of regular workout, I came back. And I completed the entire video. If feels so good when you realize that you have become stronger!\ud83d\ude0e",
    "Thank you so much for these videos! I&#39;m a 46 yr old British man living in Japan. In June I decided to really commit to losing weight. I think I searched for &quot;all standing workouts&quot; on YouTube (not good at going up and down too much) and your programme came up. I&#39;ve been doing one of your workouts 3 or 4 times a week, weights twice a week, a 30min brisk walk most evenings, and have swapped pastries &amp; cookies for bananas &amp; yoghurts, and cut out rice from my dinner. I was 100.8kg when I began (my height is 190cm to give context) and yesterday I broke the 97kg barrier for the first time in years. Very satisfying!<br>The 45s/15s format for each exercise is perfect. No single exercise is too long, there is so much variety and I generally burn 500-600g each session. I also appreciate there being no talking. I mean no disrespect to the trainers who do speak while they teach, but it can be distracting for me. It&#39;s nice to just get on with it.<br>My goal is to get down to 95kg and then see where I can go from there.<br>Once again, thank you! Not sure if these videos were intended for men as well, but they certainly work for me."
