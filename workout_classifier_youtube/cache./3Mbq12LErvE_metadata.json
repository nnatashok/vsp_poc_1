    "when is the last time you treated your body to a stretch?",
    "So, today I hit 50 pounds lost with your videos since August 1st! I rewarded myself with this stretch video \u2764 Jo, you saved my life. I wish you knew how grateful I am.",
    "If you\u2019re overweight and out of shape.. this is the video for you!!! I felt so comfortable doing all the stretching I tried doing other \u201cstretches for beginners\u201d videos but I had a hard time doing the damn stretches lol I\u2019m so glad I found this video!!",
    "What a beautiful stretching routine, The music was on point and I loved the filming spot it was so peaceful and calming just what my joints needed today. Thank you Jo \u2764",
    "This may sounds a bit clich\u00e9 but I teared up in the middle of these stretches. Maybe it was due to the music too, but it was all sorts of emotional that I was feeling. Felt sad and fulfilled that I am now doing something for myself starting today and onward. Growing up I was always fat/overweight for my height. Tried many things in my life that never seem to work or last on the long run so I gave up for a few years. Now I am slowly pushing myself to be a healthier me. I am not getting any younger and my weight has have a tremendous affect on me that I have noticed. <br><br>Thank you for these amazing videos. I am going to be following your workout routines. It is a lot of fun and seeing you smile through these workouts made me feel the positive energy you were sending to your viewers."
