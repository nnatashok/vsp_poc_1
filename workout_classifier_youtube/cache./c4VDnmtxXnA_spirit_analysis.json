Additionally, the description and comments highlight the intent to foster 'self-love and kindness' and 'improved clarity,' further confirming its soothing nature. \n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' scored at 0.6, as the video integrates 'rhythmic music' and breathwork patterns, suggesting a coordinated and continuous flow aspect, as seen in tags like 'breathwork music' and 'yoga breathe and flow.' The guidance through these rhythmic patterns supports a mind-body connection, which is a characteristic of this spirit. \n\nOther spirits were not selected due to the absence of attributes related to high intensity, technical structuring, sports performance, or outdoor elements."
