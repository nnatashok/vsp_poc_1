  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Stretching' with a score of 0.9. The video title and tags prominently mention 'hip mobility stretch' and 'hip flexibility', directly indicating a focus on improving flexibility through stretching exercises. The description further supports this by stating it's a 'hip mobility stretch' routine. \n\nThe next category is 'Yoga', scored at 0.7. Several tags, such as 'hip mobility yoga', 'hip opener yoga', suggest that yoga-inspired movements are incorporated in this routine, although it's not the central focus, judging by the lack of explicit mention in the video title and description.\n\nLastly, 'Mat' is included with a score of 0.5 as it likely involves exercises performed on a mat, indicated by the format and type of exercises that focus on body movements without substantial equipment. \n\nCategories such as 'Indoor biking', 'Body weight', and 'HIIT' were not considered due to the absence of high-intensity or specific equipment-related keywords. The overall confidence is high at 0.85, based on strong indications from multiple metadata elements."
