  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as requiring a 'mat or soft surface' in the video description. The reference to a 'Mat I use' link further supports this requirement, indicating that a mat is necessary for performing the exercises safely and effectively, especially considering the prenatal context of the workout. Therefore, a mat is identified with very high confidence (0.9) as essential equipment for this 10-minute prenatal cardio routine, likely to provide cushioning and support during exercises."
