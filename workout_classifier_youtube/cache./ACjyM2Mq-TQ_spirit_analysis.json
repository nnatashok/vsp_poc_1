  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit assigned to this video is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.95. Evidence from the title and description strongly supports this classification, emphasizing 'smile,' 'feel joy,' and relaxation benefits like reducing stress and anxiety. Tags such as 'anxiety relief music,' 'stress relief meditation,' and 'happy breathing exercises' further underscore the focus on restoration and emotional well-being.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' scoring 0.85. This choice is supported by the channel's description and the video's content, which integrate rhythmic music and breathing exercises. The title 'Guided Daily Breathwork' and tags like 'yoga breathe and flow' and 'breathwork music' indicate a smooth, continuous movement pattern in step with music and guided meditation.\n\nThe confidence level for this analysis is high (0.9) due to consistent cues throughout the metadata that align with these spirits. Other spirits were excluded due to the absence of high intensity, structured protocol, sports-specificity, or outdoor elements in the workout."
