  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video features a 'steady vinyasa flow with hip openers, backbends, standing balances and twists,' which introduces a moderate complexity not typical of beginner routines. However, it's intended 'for all levels,' suggesting simplicity in execution for basic poses. The channel emphasizes accessibility and inclusivity in yoga practice, supporting a beginner rating. Standing balances and backbends require coordination and balance, aligning with intermediate-level movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a '20 min everyday yoga flow,' designed to be repeated daily, indicating low intensity. The description of a 'full body routine' with 'a steady vinyasa flow' implies some movement but likely retains a calming pace typical of yoga, aligning with light effort. Moderate effort is considered due to the backbends and standing balances that may elevate exertion slightly for less fit users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout suits 'all levels' and is intended as a daily routine, making it highly accessible for beginners. The moderate elements like standing balances, twists, and backbends suggest some usability for individuals with slight yoga experience, hence the inclusion of intermediate fitness. Given the conservative approach for deconditioned users, the dual classification helps accommodate a wider audience."
