  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified with a primary spirit of 'High-Energy & Intense' due to several factors strongly indicating this quality. The title's use of 'Full Body Cardio HIIT' combined with terms like 'high intensity' in the description and tags ('hiit workout', 'fat burning hiit cardio workout') clearly point to a demanding workout designed for maximum effort and energy expenditure, suitable for burning fat and building endurance. These elements justify a score of 1.0, as the video perfectly embodies this spirit.\n\nThe secondary classification is 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.7. This is supported by user comments noting the inclusion of warm-ups, cool-downs, and non-repetitive yet precisely structured exercises ('no repeat'), along with a focus on alternative modifications, suggesting methodical planning and execution. Tags like 'cardio workout for beginners' and 'full body hiit workout' imply a clear workout structure adapted through levels.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Flow & Rhythm' are excluded due to the explicit emphasis on high energy and intensity, leaving little room for gentler or rhythmic qualities."
