The use of weights adds a layer of complexity, making the exercises more challenging than basic bodyweight Pilates. Comments highlighting the workout as 'challenging' and 'un-repetitive' support an intermediate to advanced classification, reflecting a need for more than basic coordination.",

Skill levels from beginner to advanced are appropriate due to self-selectable weight options and a possibility for modifications. The channel\u2019s focus on inclusive fitness supports a wide range of fitness levels. While intermediate level is the most fitting, beginners may still try at reduced intensity or with lighter weights."
