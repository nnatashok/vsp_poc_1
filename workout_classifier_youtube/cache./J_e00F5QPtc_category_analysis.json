  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified as a 'Weight workout' due to explicit references to lifting weights at home, particularly dumbbells, which are central to the workout. The title states 'FULL BODY dumbbell workout to strengthen and sculpt,' and the description describes '30 minute full body dumbbell workout.' The detailed workout routine lists exercises that all incorporate weights, such as sumo deadlift, bent arm side lateral raise, goblet squat, and dumbbell pullover. The consistent focus on dumbbell exercises throughout the provided metadata confirms a strong presence of weight training, warranting a score of 0.9 for this category. Other categories were considered but excluded due to the clear and dominant emphasis on weight training, with no significant elements of HIIT, calisthenics, or other specific workout categories."
