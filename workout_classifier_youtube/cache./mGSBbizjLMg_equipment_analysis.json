  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Upper Body Tabata Workout -- Intense 60 Minute Back, Shoulders, and Arms Workout' from FitnessBlender suggests that dumbbells are needed equipment. The tags include 'dumbbell workouts', which indicates that dumbbells are part of this workout. The description also states, 'We use PowerBlock adjustable dumbbells', clearly noting their use in the workout. Given that the workout focuses on upper body toning and strength training, and dumbbells are a common tool for such exercises, there is very high confidence (0.8) that dumbbells are required. Other metadata does not suggest additional equipment is necessary."
