    "It&#39;s amazing how every time a practice is as wonderful as this one gets my nerves calmed down and slows my thoughts as if there were clouds that got gently blown away and now the sky is clear \u2764",
    "My nervous system was so shot this week, and this practice totally helped it come back to ease. Thank you. That stretch with the back leg in low lunge and the front knee forward of the ankle with one arm high was amazing!",
    "This is the ultimate stress-relief yoga! The focus on relaxation and mindfulness is perfect for winding down. I&#39;m making this part of my daily routine."
