    "I loved the workout! \u2764 That&#39;s an instructor that knows how to motivate  beginners like me right there !! \ud83d\ude0a",
    "Just found you. This was perfect starting point for me. A lot of pride standing in my way and Ive been avoiding a restart. It\u2019s you and me now. Thank you",
    "This is something I do after my strength workout\u2014it\u2019s just 10 minutes, and I never realized how much you can actually do on an elliptical! I had no idea you could adjust speed, effort, and intensity like this, but this video really taught me something new. I\u2019ve already done it twice this week and am definitely incorporating it into my routine. The way everything appears on screen makes it so easy to follow along, and your coaching and words are super motivating. It\u2019s a short but really effective workout\u2014great job!",
    "At age 50, overweight and just beginning on the elliptical. This is a really good workout for me. Now I&#39;m wondering how many times, and how long is okay to work out in a day. Any suggestions? Thanks!",
    "Just the right amount of time and exertion for beginners. \ud83d\ude0a"
