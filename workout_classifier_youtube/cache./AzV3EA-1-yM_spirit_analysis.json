  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is best described as \"Structured & Disciplined\" with a very high confidence level (0.9) due to its methodical setup into circuits, and the explicit guidance provided. The use of words like 'routine,' 'circuit,' and 'exercise for specific seconds/rest periods' in the description emphasizes a systematic, disciplined approach typical of structured workouts. \n\nThe presence of 'Flow & Rhythm' is also noted with a moderate to high confidence score of 0.7. This stems from the consistent pattern of exercises, timing, and the follow-along format, which suggests some rhythmic aspects to the workout. However, the emphasis is less on music and more on precise timing.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are absent, as the focus is on beginners and controlled, scalable intensity. 'Soothing & Restorative' is not applicable due to the workout's active and structured nature. The lack of outdoor or adventure components excludes 'Outdoor & Adventure.'"
