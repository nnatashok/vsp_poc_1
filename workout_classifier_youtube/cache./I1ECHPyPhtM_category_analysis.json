  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as 'Meditation' with a very high confidence score of 0.95. This is strongly supported by the video title \"Guided Meditation with Mooji \u2014 The Call From Within,\" as well as the multiple references to meditation in the tags and description. Words like \"meditation,\" \"awareness,\" \"self-realization,\" and the channel's focus on spiritual guidance and presence indicate that meditation is a central theme. \n\nAdditionally, a secondary classification of 'Yoga' is considered with a low score of 0.2, primarily because of the mention of \"yoga\" in the tags and the focus on spiritual practices that can sometimes overlap with yoga philosophies and practices. However, since there is no explicit indication of physical postures or exercises typical of yoga, this category is only marginally relevant.\n\nOverall, there's very little ambiguity in the video's primary classification as a meditation session, while the potential connection to yoga is minimal and speculative."
