  "vibesExplanation": "\"The Warrior Workout\" vibe is strongly supported by the metadata due to the focus on a sweat-dripping and heart-pounding HIIT workout, as indicated by terms like \"cardio HIIT,\" \"fat-burning,\" and \"energized.\" The all-standing, no-equipment format suggests a primal, accessible approach, earning a high score of 0.75 for its alignment with the Warrior vibe.\n\nThe \"Endorphin Wave\" vibe is moderately present, evidenced by comments describing participants feeling energized, motivated, and achieving noticeable physical results. The workout's consistent structure of 45s on/15s rest and its accessible format hint at a feel-good movement quality, meriting a score of 0.5.\n\n\"The Adrenaline Rush\" vibe is also somewhat relevant, with the unpredictable nature of non-repeated exercises and the dynamic challenge it provides. This earns a lower score of 0.45, reflecting mild to moderate elements of unpredictability and intensity.\n\nOverall, the strong emphasis on intensity, accessibility, and dynamic nature of the workout leads to a high confidence level of 0.75 for the Warrior Vibe."
