    "Finally a true short spinning class not a bunch of body destroying antics. So many classes on u tube and in gyms really do some very bad exercises for legs and arms not mention bad for the bike. Thanks for a sane work out run it twice a good hour spin class.",
    "i love that you get tired too. as an instructor myself i try to keep it honest. its amazing to see you human ...if that makes sense",
    "I love these spin classes. I have a bad back but I can go all out on the bike. I have lost 11 lbs doing this and eating less. Thank you. I am feeling great."
