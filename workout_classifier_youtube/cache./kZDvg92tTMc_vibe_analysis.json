  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is categorized primarily as 'The Warrior Workout' due to its intense, full-body cardio nature, as shown by exercise names like 'JUMPING JACKS', 'HIGH KNEES SKIP', and 'HANDS OFF BURPEES'. These imply a sweat-inducing, heart-rate-elevated session. The YouTube tags include 'hiit cardio' and 'burn fat', supporting a challenging workout vibe, though the description clarifies it is a low-intensity version. User comments mention challenges and modifications for intensity, indicating a demanding session with a sense of accomplishment, hence a score of 0.75.\n\nIn addition, 'The Endorphin Wave' is a secondary match. The workout's goal is to sustain an elevated heart rate with a steady pace, and comments praise its stress-relieving effects, aligning with this vibe. The description mentions the workout as suitable for active rest days, which supports a steady build throughout the session, meriting a score of 0.65. Despite indications of high intensity, the explicit low-intensity focus and cardio nature exclude more explosive vibes like 'The Firestarter' or dance-centered vibes like 'The Groove Session.'"
