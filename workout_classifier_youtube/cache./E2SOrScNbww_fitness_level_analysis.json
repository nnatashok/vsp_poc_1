  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features basic stretching exercises such as hip rotations, straight leg good morning, and downward dog, which are typical beginner-friendly movements requiring minimal coordination or balance. The routine is described as suitable for beginners and uses standard stretch postures with no equipment. Some poses like the downward dog may involve moderate balance and coordination, which raises the complexity slightly for very deconditioned users, warranting a lower intermediate score.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique difficulty primarily classified as beginner, with minor aspects that might be slightly challenging for very deconditioned individuals, the required fitness level is strongly aligned with 'Beginner.' The intermediate level is included due to potential coordination and flexibility challenges for complete beginners, as user comments suggest improvement in flexibility and mobility which might initially challenge an absolute novice."
