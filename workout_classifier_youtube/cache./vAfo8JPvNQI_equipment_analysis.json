  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "After analyzing the metadata for the video \"Guided Meditation for Mornings: Clear Negativity Open Chakras Awaken Vital Energy After Sleep\" by Michael Sealey, it can be concluded that no physical workout equipment is required. The video is focused on guided meditation and mindfulness practices aimed at clearing negativity and opening chakras, which are typically conducted using mental focus rather than physical exercise equipment. The tags and description repeatedly emphasize meditation, healing, and energy-focused practices without any indication of physical exercise or equipment usage. Comments and channel information further support this as they focus on relaxation, personal transformation, and mental health benefits. Therefore, this video supports a bodyweight/mind-only approach, and it appears to be centered around auditory guidance without the need for physical equipment."
