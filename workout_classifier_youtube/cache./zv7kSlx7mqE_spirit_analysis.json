  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit scores a 0.9 due to the clear methodical approach of the workout, as evidenced by the \"14 days challenge\" and the emphasis on following \"a structured 8 week guide\" through the LEAN app, implying a consistent and principled training regimen. Furthermore, the video title and description highlight core activation and pilates, which stresses technical precision and consistency, indicating a robust structured methodology. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present, scoring 0.7, as Pilates itself incorporates smooth, fluid movements that align with breathing, enhancing coordination and control. The title \"Pilates Abs\" suggests the rhythmic flow intrinsic to Pilates routines. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' were considered due to the comment about feeling the burn; however, the primary focus on core activation with controlled movements typical of Pilates and the absence of overt high-intensity language in the metadata made it less fitting. Additionally, the calming element of Pilates excluded 'Soothing & Restorative' despite the inner strength comments, as the focus is more on activation and challenge rather than relaxation."
