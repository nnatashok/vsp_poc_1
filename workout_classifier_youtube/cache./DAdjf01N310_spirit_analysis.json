  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video exhibits a strong 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, as indicated by comments describing the session as 'water-flowing' and 'like dancing,' highlighting smooth and continuous movement patterns. Tags such as 'morning pilates' and 'full body workout pilates' support the idea of rhythm and coordination characteristic of pilates. Therefore, a high score of 0.9 is assigned.\n\nAdditionally, the description and comments emphasize the energizing yet restorative nature of the workout, mentioning its suitability for easing muscle soreness without high intensity, typical of a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The description invites participants to 'wake up and energize your body,' reflecting a gentle encouragement to start the day with this workout, justifying a score of 0.7 for this spirit.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' and other spirits do not apply here, as there\u2019s a clear absence of intensive or adrenaline-pumping elements in the metadata, focusing instead on flow, grace, and moderate exertion."
