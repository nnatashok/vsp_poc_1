  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title and description specifically mention this is a 'No Equipment' workout, which strongly suggests minimal equipment is needed. However, the description explicitly notes you'll need 'just you and your mat,' indicating the use of a mat is required. Additionally, a link and discount code for a specific mat (Liforme) is provided, which further emphasizes its use. Given that Pilates often involves exercises performed on the floor, a mat is likely essential for comfort and support. Therefore, the confidence level for requiring a mat is very high at 0.9."
