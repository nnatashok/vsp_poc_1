    "Fun and Feisty for sure!!! Perfect finisher for my spin workout this morning!!! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc4d",
    "What a great 10 minute all body workout!  Definitely raining here, after the 30 min Pop ride.  Thanks!",
    "So happy to be able to get in a full body in such a short amount of time. And I loved the ab segment right in the middle. Those side plank lifts are my nemesis but they are definitely getting easier by sticking with your strength videos.",
    "\ud83d\ude4c Another awesome workout! Great, quick full body strength training!\ud83d\udc95"
