  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the workout \"5 MIN HIP MOBILITY STRETCH AND WARM UP\" is 'Soothing & Restorative.' This classification is strongly supported by phrases like 'hip mobility stretch' and the instructional aim of increasing 'hip flexibility.' The description emphasizes daily use for flexibility and pain relief, aligning with restorative qualities. User comments such as 'I feel so much better' and 'manageable soreness' further reinforce this idea. This justification supports a score of 0.9, indicating an extremely strong match.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a score of 0.6. Although not a primary focus, the mention of 'stretch and warm-up' suggests an emphasis on smooth, coordinated movements typical of flow workouts. Tags like 'hip opener yoga' also imply a rhythmic nature, fitting with the mind-body connection aspect, albeit not as dominantly evident as the restorative quality. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to lack of emphasis on fast-paced or athletic training. The overall classification confidence is high (0.85), based on clear restorative elements and some rhythmic components."
