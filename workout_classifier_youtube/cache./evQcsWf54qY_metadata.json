No major cardio exercises or jumping here. You\u2019ll start with a relaxing warm-up, then shift into some energizing bodyweight exercises that don\u2019t repeat, in order to keep things interesting.\n\r\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/2fI9FLI\r\n\r\nConnect with CBC Life Online:\r\nVisit our website for more lifestyle videos: http://www.cbc.ca/life\r\nLike us on Facebook: http://fb.com/cbclife\r\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/cbclife\r\nLike us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/cbclife\r\n\r\nAbout CBC Life:\r\nFrom life\u2019s little projects to its big questions, CBC Life offers Canadians inspired ideas and conversations that help them live better, including things to make, do, buy, wear and eat. \r\n\r\n\r\nFull-body mat workout for period and PMS | Low impact + no repeat\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9RCDP_E34ocnXo3aBKQi2g",

    "Agree with Amber: those encouraging words at the end were it. Had a really tough day emotionally and really did not feel like working out. Thank you for this awesome workout and thoughtful encouragement",
    "Amazing!  Omg I didn\u2019t even feel the time, it was amazing! This is great for my 1st and 2nd day period. Thanks! Super motivated!",
    "Thank you for the encouraging word at the end, it was so appreciated. My period has been draining and I missed 2 days of working out and so I didn&#39;t want it to be three so I decided to do this workout to slowly ease myself back into being active. This was a good  workout. Nice pace but also worked up a slight sweat.",
    "I enjoyed this workout! I did this on the last day of my cycle. I would never try this on the 1st or even the 2nd day due to the intense ab movements, but it was great for the end! I also enjoyed the instructor\u2019s energy very much. \ud83d\udc96",
    "Exactly what I needed today! Thanks!"
