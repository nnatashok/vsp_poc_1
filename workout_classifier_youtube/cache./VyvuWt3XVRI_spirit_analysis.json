  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout in question is best classified under 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits. The 'Flow & Rhythm' aspect is evident from the continuous, smooth movement pattern typical of Pilates, as indicated by terms like \"deep core activation\" and \"8 min Pilates Workout\" in the title and description, which emphasize a seamless integration of mental and physical focus (score: 0.75). The inclusion of music, flow, and core-centric exercises reinforce this classification, lending it a high confidence.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is supported by the mention of a \"14-day challenge\" and \"intense\" nature of the workout, suggesting a planned, methodical approach to improving core strength over a fixed period (score: 0.65). The channel's promotion of consistency and structured routines through its app and additional materials further supports this classification.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' were not selected despite the use of the word \"intense\" since Pilates fundamentally lacks the high-impact cardio intensity typically associated with this spirit."
