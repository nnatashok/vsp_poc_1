  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Mat' with a strong score of 0.8 due to its focus on various floor exercises such as 'Squat side reach', 'Bird Dog', and 'Kneeling push ups', which are consistent with general mat exercises. The mention of 'no equipment', 'beginner friendly', and 'out of bed workout' further supports this, emphasizing exercises that can be conducted on an exercise mat.\n\nThe secondary category 'Stretching' is assigned with a moderate score of 0.6. Although the primary focus is on gentle movement exercises, the description and some tags like 'morning stretch' and 'feel good workout' suggest elements of stretching to wake up the body and enhance mobility. However, given the primary focus on broader mat-based exercises, stretching is not as dominant.\n\nOther categories such as 'Body weight' and 'Yoga' were considered but are not as suitable due to the lack of emphasis on specific bodyweight strength training moves or yoga postures and flows. The overall confidence for these selected categories is high at 0.9, as the metadata strongly indicates a beginner-friendly mat-based workout with elements of stretching."
