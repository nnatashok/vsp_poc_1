  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated as Beginner to Intermediate due to the nature of elliptical machine use. Operating an elliptical is straightforward, requiring minimal coordination compared to more complex machines or exercises. The beginner level is strongly supported by the repeated tags 'beginner elliptical workout' and '10 Min All-Out Elliptical HIIT Workout'. The inclusion of 'Workout Level: Beginner/Intermediate' in the description suggests a slight increase in coordination for users not familiar with using varied resistance levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as Moderate to Challenging, justified by the '10 Min All-Out Elliptical HIIT Workout' tag. The workout involves a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format with all-out pace intervals and the choice of resistance, enhancing exertion. The description suggests notable calorie burn, implying a Moderate to Challenging effort, especially for deconditioned users. However, the workout's short duration and rest intervals contribute to a Moderate baseline, while the HIIT aspect pushes it towards Challenging.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is determined to be from Beginner to Advanced, with strong confidence in Beginner and Intermediate levels. The 'Workout Level: Beginner/Intermediate' clearly suggests it's approachable for those new to exercise or less fit individuals, supported by user comments from those overcoming health issues. However, as it offers options for increasing resistance and performing HIIT, there's a moderate fit for more experienced exercisers looking at advanced exertion levels through variable pace and resistance. The short 10-minute duration may challenge deconditioned users, justifying the inclusion of Advanced for those intensifying the effort with higher resistance settings."
