We aren\u00b4t all yogis living in caves, so we have our daily duties as human beings to do. And if you don\u00b4t like where you are at in life, that's okay. You can change. It comes from within, and begins every morning. It's a reminder for me as well that sometimes we put things off, forgetting that the future isn't guaranteed. We all have a reason that we are here, let's get out of bed, count our blessings and do what needs to be done. With love in our heart. \nMuch love,\nSandy \n\n\nRegular practice of Breathwork can bring real change to your life Including boosted immune system, lowered stress and inflammation, better focus, more energy and the list goes on.

  "channelDescription": "Sharing the power of the breath with weekly guided exercises \n \n\nFrom world traveler to breathwork facilitator and content creator, I'm here putting a 21st century spin on ancient breathing techniques infused with rhythmic music that I produce myself. So the music, video editing, voice over and all else is done by me, with a heart intention behind it all.  I greatly appreciate all of the support helping me continue to improve. \n\nI create these videos and music with love, aiming to uplift and bring positivity. Longer sessions offer a variety of benefits, including heart opening,manifestation, dissolving of the ego and self limiting beliefs, releasing trauma, and accessing altered states of consciousness. For an enhanced experience, I recommend wearing headphones.\n\nIf you want to deepen your practice and receive longer breathwork videos + Meditations you can join our Patreon community:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/breathewithsandy\n\nMuch love,\nSandy \n\n\n",
