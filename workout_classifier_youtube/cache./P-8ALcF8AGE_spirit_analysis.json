  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video, titled 'Guided Meditation for Self Love,' is primarily characterized by the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. Evidence for this is found extensively throughout the metadata. The description highlights elements such as 'full body relaxation,' 'self love affirmations,' and 'energy visualization exercises,' all of which strongly suggest a focus on gentle, healing activities aimed at promoting self-love and relaxation. The emphasis on 'positive affirmations' and 'cultivating more self love, self confidence & self worth' further aligns with restorative practices that encourage internal healing and stress reduction. Additionally, the comments reflect profound personal emotional experiences, with several viewers mentioning how the video helped them calm down or cry as a form of emotional release, indicating the session's restorative impact. The absence of any elements related to intensity, structure, or outdoor contexts reinforces the confidence that 'Soothing & Restorative' is the sole applicable spirit with a high confidence score of 0.95."
