  "categoriesExplanation": "The metadata strongly indicates that this video is a guided meditation, which is the primary focus. The title uses 'Guided Meditation,' and the description repeatedly mentions meditation, supported by tags such as 'meditation,' 'self-inquiry,' and 'awareness.' This gives a very high confidence level for the 'Meditation' category at 0.95, as it aligns directly with the content's purpose and Mooji's teachings on mindfulness and presence. \n\nThe 'Yoga' category has a lower score of 0.35, mainly because 'yoga' is listed as a tag, and there are references to spiritual practices that sometimes overlap with yoga disciplines focusing on mindfulness and self-realization. However, the core content is more centered on meditation practices rather than physical postures typical of traditional yoga workouts, so the Yoga category is not a major component. \n\nNo categories such as 'Body weight' or 'Mat' are applicable here as the session doesn't include physical exercises typically associated with those categories. The channel's overall content on spirituality and awareness supports these classifications."
