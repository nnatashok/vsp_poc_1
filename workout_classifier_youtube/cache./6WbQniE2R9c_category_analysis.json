  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Stretching' with a high score of 0.9. The title 'Relaxing FULL BODY STRETCH // Flexibility & Mobility' and tags such as 'full body stretch', 'stretching routine', and 'stretch for sore muscles' strongly indicate stretching-focused content. The description corroborates this by mentioning that the routine targets major muscle groups to improve flexibility and mobility. This, combined with comments praising the stretching component, justifies the high score and confidence in this category.\n\n' Mat' is scored 0.6, reflecting its moderate presence as the workout is performed on an exercise mat, suitable for floor exercises. The description and equipment list reference using an exercise mat, supporting the inclusion of this category, though it is secondary to the stretching focus.\n\nOther categories were considered but excluded, as the emphasis is on stretching and not on strength, high-intensity, or cardio exercises. The clear indicators in the metadata provide a strong basis for the chosen categories."
