  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the video, dictated by both the title and description, aligns very strongly with 'Soothing & Restorative'. The workout is labeled as a 'Guided Meditation', which inherently suggests a focus on relaxation and inner peace. The description emphasizes aligning thoughts and actions with one's 'purest essence', seeking stillness, and finding solace, all of which are indicative of a soothing approach meant for stress reduction and relaxation. Additionally, user comments reflect profound emotional release and introspection, common outcomes of a restorative practice, further reinforcing this spirit. Given the nature of meditation, high-energy or structured spirits are not applicable here. The available information leads to a very high confidence level in classifying this as a restorative session focused on personal insight and calmness."
