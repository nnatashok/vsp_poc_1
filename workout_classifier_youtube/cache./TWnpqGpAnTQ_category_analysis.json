  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video titled '20 MIN NO JUMPING CARDIO - BURN CALORIES WITHOUT HURTING YOUR JOINTS' is best classified into 'Mat' and 'Body weight' categories. The tags and description highlight 'no jumping' cardio as suitable for those with knee injuries, suggesting a focus on low-impact, body weight exercises. Specific listed exercises such as knee raises, punches, leg kicks, and lateral taps indicate movements typically done on a mat without equipment. The channel description and metadata confirm this, emphasizing body weight workouts. User comments also describe it as a beginner-friendly, no-jumping workout, reinforcing the low-impact nature designed for joint protection. Given the absence of high-intensity intervals or equipment usage, 'HIIT' and 'Weight workout' are not applicable, leading to high confidence in these chosen categories with scores of 0.8 for Mat and 0.7 for Body weight, based on the central presence of these exercise types."
