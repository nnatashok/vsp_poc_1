  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video appears to focus on High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which is typically designed to be performed using bodyweight exercises. The metadata, including the title and tags, emphasizes the full-body nature of the workout and the ease of performing it at home without any specific equipment mentioned. The description references the Les Mills Grits workout, which is known for its bodyweight exercises that do not require additional equipment.\n\nThe user comments also do not mention the use of any equipment, reinforcing the idea that this is likely a bodyweight-oriented workout. Thus, based on the metadata available, there is no explicit mention or implication of any required equipment, leading to the conclusion that this workout is bodyweight only."
