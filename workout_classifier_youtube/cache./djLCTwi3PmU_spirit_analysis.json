  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this video is 'Flow & Rhythm', which is reflected in the title, '20 Min Morning Yoga Flow', and the emphasis on 'vinyasa flow' in the description. Vinyasa yoga is inherently rhythmic, focusing on smooth and continuous movements, which aligns with the spirit of Flow & Rhythm. Therefore, this spirit is given a strong score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also applicable, as the video is described to start the day mindfully and to \"centre,\" invoke relaxation, and involve 'hip openers, backbends and standing balances', which are typically calming and restorative movements. The comments refer to the video as \"calming\" and emphasize being in a \"natural environment,\" further suggesting a soothing quality, thus receiving a score of 0.7.\n\nLastly, 'Outdoor & Adventure' is considered due to the comments about practicing in natural settings like the woods. Although not directly visible in the metadata, the frequent references by viewers to practicing in nature supports the inclusion of this spirit, albeit with moderate confidence and a score of 0.6. The video likely features an outdoor setting, enhancing the adventurous and nature-immersed aspect of the practice."
