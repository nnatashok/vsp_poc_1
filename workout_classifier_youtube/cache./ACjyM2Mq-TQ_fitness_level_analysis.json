  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video involves breathwork exercises, which typically require a beginner to intermediate understanding of technique. The description and tags like 'guided breathwork meditation' and 'yoga breathing exercises' suggest simplicity, as breathwork generally focuses on basic breathing techniques with guidance. The technique complexity increases slightly because of references to 'Wim Hof breathing technique' and 'pranayama', which can be slightly more complex requiring practice. Hence, a high score for 'Beginner' and a lower score for 'Intermediate'.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Breathwork is generally light in terms of physical exertion, requiring minimal energy expenditure as indicated by terms focused on relaxation in metadata such as 'stress relief', 'enhanced focus', and 'increased energy'. However, a slight increase in effort may be noted due to the session's near 21-minute duration and the mention of 'energizing breathing exercises', thus giving it a minor 'Moderate' score.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout primarily targets beginners, supported by guided instructions and an emphasis on relieving stress and enhancing well-being, as seen in metadata focus on positivity and relaxation. Breathwork is accessible to most individuals regardless of fitness baseline, leading to a high beginner score. Some intermediate consideration is given due to the potential complexity of techniques like Wim Hof breathing, and the nearly 21-minute duration, justifying a slightly elevated 'Intermediate' fitness level score."
