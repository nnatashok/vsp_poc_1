  "vibesExplanation": "The video 'Post Workout Stretch | Full Body | 15 Minutes of Stress Relief & Recovery' fits primarily into 'The Reboot Workout' vibe. This is due to its focus on post-workout stretching, described as a means of stress relief and recovery. This aligns with the idea of a 'total-body refresh,' intended for deep stretches and relaxation post-exercise. The lack of music and talking, mentioned in user comments, emphasizes its calming and restorative nature, garnering a score of 0.9. \n\nAdditionally, 'The Zen Flow' vibe is applicable here due to the video's grounding approach as perceived by users who enjoyed the silence and simplicity, allowing for a breath-centered and unhurried experience. A score of 0.7 reflects these elements.\n\nFinally, there is a moderate relevance to 'The Meditative Grind' due to the repetitive, focused nature of stretching that requires zoning into the bodily sensations rather than external stimuli, thus a score of 0.4. The absence of music and talking supports a meditative state, as noted in user comments praising the silence."
