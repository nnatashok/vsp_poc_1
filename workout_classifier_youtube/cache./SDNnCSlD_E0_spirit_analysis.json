  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit (score: 0.75) due to its postpartum focus and the incorporation of a babywearing element. The description highlights it as a healing practice, suitable for recovery and strengthening post-birth, coupled with a cautionary note on safety and suitability, common in restorative workouts. Furthermore, babywearing typically minimizes workout intensity, aligning it with restorative exercise characterized by gentle, supportive movements.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.6) is also relevant, albeit to a lesser degree, as the workout involves smooth, continuous movements that accommodate a baby in a carrier, as indicated by comments describing the workout's ability to soothe babies to sleep. This suggests some rhythmic elements are involved, possible through coordinated, repetitive motions that create a calming environment for both mother and child.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to a lack of emphasis on intensity or rigid routines, respectively. The workout's primary goal is to facilitate mother and baby bonding while engaging in gentle exercise, rather than achieving high-performance metrics."
