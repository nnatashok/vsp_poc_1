  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified in the 'Meditation' category with very high confidence due to multiple strong indicators in the metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'Guided Meditation,' which is a clear cue for the category. The description refers to the video as providing 'relief from perspective,' which aligns with meditative practices aimed at mental clarity and self-awareness. The tags include 'guided,' 'meditation,' 'enlightenment,' and 'awakening,' all of which are indicative of content focusing on meditation and mindfulness. Additionally, the comments highlight the use of the video by therapists for mental health purposes, reinforcing its meditation function. Due to these factors, the Meditation category was chosen with a score of 0.9 to reflect its centrality to the video's content. No evidence suggests the presence of physical activity, so other categories like 'Yoga,' 'Breathing exercises,' or physical workout categories were excluded."
