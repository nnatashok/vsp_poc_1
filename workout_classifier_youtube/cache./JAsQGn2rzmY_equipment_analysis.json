  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"15 min METABOLIC BOOSTING cycling workout\" explicitly indicates that it is a cycling workout. The description further stresses that this is an indoor cycling session intended to boost metabolism. Cycling terminology such as 'resistance', 'RPMs', and 'pedal stroke', along with specific chapters named 'CLIMBS', 'ROLLING HILLS', and 'INVERTED SPRINTS', strongly suggest that the workout is performed on an exercise bike. Additionally, the channel name \"Kaleigh Cohen Cycling\" and channel description emphasize cycle training, reinforcing that an exercise bike is necessary. Thus, the confidence score for the exercise bike being required is very high at 1.0."
