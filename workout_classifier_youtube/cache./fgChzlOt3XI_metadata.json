    "The Dalai Lama said,  if we would teach every 8 years old, how to meditate,  in one generation,  all the wars and disagreements would disappear and we would be able to solve the world problems without any issue and worries...Who&#39;s ready to meditate today ? \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764",
    "There are many spiritual meditation guider through out the world... but when its come about India they really makes our heart with full divinity.... love my india  and our religion",
    "When you said &quot; I&#39;ve reached home, the place where I belong&quot; I was in  tears\u2728\ud83d\udcab",
    "Every time I meditate listening to it, I beleive I become a bit more closer to my soul and to God and I feel I am healed a bit more each day. When I meditate there is no time I had no tears; the voice, the music and the meaning of the guided meditation is simply pure and magical. Thank you is a very small word for Shivani sister and BKs  for the difference that they made to my life. By nature we all wanted to be loved and only love the ppl around. May each and every soul in the world be healed by God&#39;s energy and may our souls be filled with love, purity and peace. Om Shanti!"
