  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category identified for this workout is 'Stretching' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This decision is based on the title, '15 MIN DAILY STRETCH (full body)', and the recurring emphasis on stretching in both the description and tags, such as 'stretch routine', 'full body stretch', and 'flexibility'. The description specifically mentions a focus on 'stretching tight muscles' and improving 'flexibility & mobility'. The secondary category selected is 'Yoga', with a score of 0.6. Although the video is focused on stretching, several tags and the description incorporate 'yoga', and comments suggest a holistic, mellow workout experience similar to yoga practices. However, the lack of explicit yoga postures or full practice descriptions suggests it plays a supportive rather than central role in the workout. Other categories like 'Mat' or 'Pilates' were considered but dismissed due to insufficient evidence in the metadata prioritizing stretching and yoga elements."
