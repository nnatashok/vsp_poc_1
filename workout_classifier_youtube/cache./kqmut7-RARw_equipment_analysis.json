  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a 45-minute yoga routine, as indicated in the title and description. Yoga commonly requires a mat for comfort and grip during floor exercises, which aligns with the typical needs for a yoga session. The description mentions vinyasa flow sequences, sun salutations, hip openers, backbends, and standing balances, all of which suggest movements performed on the floor or with feet grounded, further supporting the need for a mat. While the metadata doesn't explicitly mention a mat, the nature of yoga strongly implies its use, justifying a high confidence score of 0.9 for the mat."
