As a certified fitness coach people are always surprised to hear that I have to watch my blood pressure. Hypertension runs in my family and if i'm not careful my blood pressure creeps UP there. In fact I can hear my 100 year old grandmother (yes she's 100!) in my head all the time reminding me to \u201ccut the salt honey. You can't have salt in your life with our family genes!\u201d That\u2019s one reason I choose to lead a healthy lifestyle and stay active. I can keep my blood pressure low without medication through exercise and diet. In this video, I want to show you a quick low impact workout that can be used in the management of high blood pressure.\n\nExercise lowers blood pressure by reducing blood vessel stiffness so blood can flow more easily. The effects of exercise are most noticeable during and immediately after a workout.\n\nOne way to combat high blood pressure might be to break up your workout into several sessions throughout the day. In fact, one study found that three 10-minute walks a day more effectively prevented future blood pressure spikes than one 30-minute trek per day. But if you cant make it outdoors to get your steps in, this 10 minute low impact home workout combines dynamic exercises that are safe to do multiple times throughout your day to keep your blood pressure in a good place. In this routine we have 10 different exercises performed for one minute sequenced back to back. Once we start there are no programmed breaks, but of course listen to your body and modify as needed to meet yourself where you are at today. The goal is just to get moving to feel better together for 10 minutes total.\n\nDaily exercise not only helps control high blood pressure but it also helps manage your weight, strengthen your heart and reduce stress. Trust me nothing feels better than taking control and seeing your health improve. So join me and keep your blood pressure in check the natural way. Use this workout 2-3 times per day for at least a week. Make sure to monitor your blood pressure numbers and share what positive health effects you experience below in the comments.\n\nWhen it comes to taking care of yourself and improving your health I want you to remember: you can do anything you set your mind to. Are you ready? YOU CAN DO THIS! Let's get moving!\n\nPositive Feel Good Fitness,\n-Caroline Jordan\n\n\ud83d\udc47SUBSCRIBE TO CAROLINE\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL NOW\ud83d\udc47\nhttps://bit.ly/3zIHqnS\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://bit.ly/3E25xAm \n\nSHOP MERCH HERE: \ud83d\udecd\ufe0f\nhttps://bit.ly/carolinejordanmerch\n\n\u2728\u2728\u2728 CONNECT WITH CAROLINE ON SOCIAL MEDIA \u2728\u2728\u2728 \nCaroline Jordan Blog: https://carolinejordanfitness.com/blog/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/carolinejordanfitness\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/carolinejordanfitness/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/carolinefitness\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.ph/carolinejordanfitness/ \nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolinejordanfitness\n \n\ud83d\udcaaTRAINING AND PROGRAMS \ud83d\udcbb\n\u25b6\ufe0e HURT FOOT FITNESS EXCLUSIVE COACHING PROGRAM: https://www.hurtfootfitness.com\n\u25b6\ufe0e WORKOUT VIDEO LIBRARY: https://www.hurtfootfitness.com/workout-video-library\n\u25b6\ufe0e HURT FOOT DIET GUIDE: https://www.hurtfootfitness.com/healingdiet\n\u25b6\ufe0e STRONG BODY PROGRAM: https://www.hurtfootfitness.com/strongbody\n\u25b6\ufe0e DIABETES WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM: https://hurtfootfitness.com/diabetes-exercises-for-weight-loss-workout-program\n\u25b6\ufe0e SCIATIC NERVE PAIN RELIEF PROGRAM: https://get-pain-relief-now.teachable.com/p/sciatic-nerve-pain-relief\n\n#CarolineJordan  #lowerbloodsugar #patreon #cjfitsquad \n\nDISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.

    "hi. My name is Domenick and I am 54 years old.  I have been on BP medication now for about 20 years. High BP runs in my family. For the past 3 months have been walking quite a bit each day, about 12,500 steps, 6-7 days per week.  I walk for about 1 hour early in the morning and for about 1/2 hr after lunch.  I monitor my BP regularly and noticed my numbers going down to a consistent 110/65 so I decided to stop taking my meds.  I have been checking my pressure 3 x per day and it has remained under 120/80 for over a week now.  I did also lose 15 lbs however i have lost weight in the past (without exercise) and still needed to take my BP meds.  I really do think walking every day is what made a huge difference. I will continue checking my BP each day for at least a month and will let my cardiologist aware of what i&#39;m doing.",
    "Wow - I did this workout this morning for the first time , I\u2019ve been up since 5am as my BP is creeping up to 170/115 and I\u2019ve been worrying about it. So I typed in Exercises to reduce BP in YouTube and this video popped up. I did the workout once, sat and did some slow breathing exercises for 5 mins . My BP before the exercise was 158/115. Afterwards it was 127/97. I did a second reading to confirm 129/98. <br>I will be incorporating this workout into my daily routine at least once a day, i will comment again in a months time to update if anyone is interested. <br>Thankyou Caroline for this video.",
    "May the Lord God bless you Caroline, just started this exercises 4 days now and bp back to normal from 166/90 to 130 down back to 120/80 may the Lord God restore our health and I decree and declare that we will all live longer in Jesus name \ud83d\ude4f",
    "My 2 weeks process:<br><br>Day 1: 197/140<br>Day 2: 180/134<br>Day 3: 178/121<br>Day 4: 160/116*<br>Day 5: 162/124*<br>Day 6: 159/112*<br>Day 7: 162/107*<br>Day 8: 161/113*<br>Day 9: 160/114*<br>Day 10: 164/112*<br>Day 11: 159/106*<br>Day 12: 167/113*<br>Day 13: 170/120*<br>Day 14: 166/111*<br><br>Thank you @Caroline Jordan"
