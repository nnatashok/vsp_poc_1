  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is firmly classified under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit based on several strong indicators from the metadata. The title 'Calm Guided Meditation to Gain Abundance, Love & Happiness' directly points to a peaceful and restorative experience, focusing on mental well-being rather than physical exertion. The description reinforces this by mentioning the guided nature of the meditation and its intent to open the participant to happiness, love, and abundance, all hallmarks of a restorative practice. The channel, Omvana by Mindvalley, emphasizes resources for relaxation and meditation, further supporting this classification.\n\nUser comments like praying for dreams to come true and expressions of positivity suggest a focus on mental peace and emotional renewal. With Bob Proctor's focus on consciousness and fulfillment through meditation, there are no indicators of other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility'. Overall, the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is clearly embodied, warranting a high confidence level of 0.95."
