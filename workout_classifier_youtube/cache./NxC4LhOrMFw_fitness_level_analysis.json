The description emphasizes therapeutic sequences for stress relief and increased range of motion, typical of beginner-level yoga focusing on specific body parts. The use of coordination or balance is minimal, aligning with a beginner classification. However, the inclusion of terms like 'increase flexibility' and 'small muscles' hints at a slight degree of complexity, giving a mild alignment with intermediate.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout's technique difficulty is dominantly beginner, with minimal coordination or balance challenges, making it accessible to new exercisers. The light effort required aligns with this, as the workout duration is short and specific to gentle stretching and therapeutic care. While some users with conditions like carpal tunnel benefit, indicating potentially more advanced users, this doesn't increase the fitness level requirement itself but suggests utility across levels. Hence, while strongly suitable for beginners, intermediate users with specific needs might also find it relevant."
