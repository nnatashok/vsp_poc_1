  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout primarily includes simple bodyweight exercises such as squats, calf raises, and glute bridges, which are commonly considered beginner-friendly movements as they require minimal coordination and technical skill. Although push-ups and planks may require some strength and stability, they are still within the beginner to intermediate range due to their straightforward nature. The presence of exercises like hamstring curls and seated straight leg raises further support a lower technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is succinct and designed to be a 5-minute routine, focusing on bodyweight exercises with low energy expenditure. While it is short in duration, it includes exercises that can be moderately challenging for beginners, such as push-ups and planks, hence a moderate score is assigned in addition to a light effort classification. The comments highlight its accessibility for beginners and those new to exercise, underscoring its light to moderate effort level especially when performed once or twice back-to-back as an option.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulty, the workout is firmly within the beginner category, designed for individuals new to exercise or returning after a hiatus. However, the option to repeat the routine back-to-back or engage with slightly more challenging exercises like push-ups and planks provides an intermediate dimension for those slightly more familiar with exercise routines. The user feedback highlights the workout's suitability for beginners, including those with conditions like asthma, indicating a welcoming level for new exercisers."
