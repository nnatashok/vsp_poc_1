  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe chosen for this workout is 'The Firestarter,' with a score of 0.8. This is strongly supported by the title and description emphasizing 'High Intensity' and 'HIIT,' as well as the structured intervals and high resistance levels (6-8) mentioned in the description. The workout's short duration (15 minutes) and explosive bursts during intervals align perfectly with the 'Fast, explosive, and electrifying' nature of this vibe.\n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Endorphin Wave,' with a score of 0.6. The description and top comments indicate a feel-good, endorphin-releasing experience, with one user mentioning completing it with high resistance that resulted in a 'refreshing and cooling' cooldown. This suggests a steady build and elevated energy typically associated with this vibe. \n\nOther vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' were considered but scored lower due to less emphasis on primal, beastly energy or heavy strength-focused exercises, making 'The Firestarter' and 'The Endorphin Wave' better fits."
