This is evidenced by words like 'therapeutic sequence,' 'release built-up stress,' and focusing on combating tension and discomfort which align well with the idea of a restorative and refreshing workout. The vibe score of 0.9 reflects extremely strong alignment due to specific language in the description emphasizing stress relief and increased range of motion.\n\n'The Zen Flow' vibe is also present, with a score of 0.75, due to the calm, grounding nature of yoga focused on breath and gentle movement. The use of 'Namaste' and 'check in and care for yourself' are indicators of an intentionally mindful practice typically associated with 'The Zen Flow.'\n\nAdditionally, 'The Comfort Moves' is relevant at a score of 0.6 due to comments and descriptors like 'therapeutic' and 'soothing pain,' indicating safe, feel-good movement, especially for beginners or those with physical discomfort. This is further supported by the gentle nature of the practice and the supportive feedback from users."
