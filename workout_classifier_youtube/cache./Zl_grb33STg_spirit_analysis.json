  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this video is 'Structured & Disciplined', with a confidence score of 0.9. The video's focus on specific protocols for burning more calories while weight lifting, such as modifying weight, reps, and exercise selection, is highly methodical. The description mentions following tweaks based on scientific studies, highlighting a disciplined approach to exercise planning. The video's systematic nature is further emphasized by detailed instructions and the discussion of specific weight lifting strategies like lighter weights for more reps and compound exercises. \n\nAdditionally, 'High-Energy & Intense' is present, with a score of 0.6. Although weight lifting is typically less intense than cardio, the video's emphasis on maximizing calorie burning through continuous movement across exercises and minimal rest periods contributes to a high-energy environment. This is seen in comments suggesting circuits and shorter breaks to maintain elevated heart rates.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' was not selected because the workout lacks continuous, smooth, and dance-like movements; 'Soothing & Restorative' is unsuitable given the calorie-burning and muscle-building goals. 'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the indoor, weight-based context and lack of sports-specific skills."
