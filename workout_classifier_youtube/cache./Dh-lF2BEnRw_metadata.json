    "I&#39;m 112 kg girl . LIKE my comment so I keep coming to this video.",
    "Can I just say that it helps so much to see a real reaction to exercising even for a fit person. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to want to keep working out when your instructor is so energetic and unfazed by the exercise. So to see that it\u2019s even hard or uncomfortable for you helps us that struggles. It just make me feel less alone I guess. Idk. Thank you for making videos that let us know hey it\u2019s easier than you think and you can do it too",
    "while i\u2019m not overweight, i am out of shape, and this workout has helped me get moving even with severe depression. i can\u2019t get out of bed most days for more than an hour so just using my muscles in any way makes me feel really good. thank you for this :)",
    "I haven\u2019t moved my body in nearly a year, gained a lot of weight and I\u2019m in really bad shape. This workout was just what I needed! Doing something IS really better than doing nothing. So thank you for getting me moving.",
    "This got me up and going for doing things today. Just enough blood flowing to make me want to be productive I saved this and will definitely use again"
