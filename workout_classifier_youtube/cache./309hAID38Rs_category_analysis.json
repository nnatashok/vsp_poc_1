  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary focus of this video is on 'Breathing exercises,' as evidenced by multiple direct mentions of 'breathing exercise,' 'breath retention,' and 'deep pranayama' in both the title and description. The structured nature of the breathing rounds, including varying hold times, further supports this categorization. The high score (0.9) reflects explicit and repeated emphasis on advanced breathing techniques intended for relaxation and health benefits. Additionally, 'Meditation' as a category is included due to the relaxation and mindfulness aspect present in both the video description and the channel name ('Hands-On Meditation'). The channel's focus on meditation practices and user comments highlighting improved calmness and recovery suggest the secondary aspect of meditation, warranting a score of 0.6. Other categories were considered less relevant as there's no focus on physical movement, which eliminates Pilates, Yoga, or Mat classifications. The overall confidence rating is high (0.85) due to the clear and explicit categorization in the video description and channel content."
