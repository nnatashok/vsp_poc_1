  "categoriesExplanation": "The video focuses on a 10-minute yoga routine targeted at beginners, as indicated by the title '10-Minute Yoga for Beginners' and repeated mention of 'yoga' throughout the tags and description. The description emphasizes this as an introductory yoga session designed for those new to the practice, reinforcing the category choice. Moreover, the video involves yoga poses, breathing techniques, and mindful movements, justifying a high score of 0.95 for 'Yoga'. The description and comments also suggest the presence of gentle stretches and foundational poses, which aligns with elements of a 'Stretching' workout, granting it a score of 0.4. However, the yoga aspect is more predominant. Other categories were considered but excluded due to the strong focus on yoga-specific elements without sufficient indicators for activities like Pilates, Meditation, or Mat workouts."
