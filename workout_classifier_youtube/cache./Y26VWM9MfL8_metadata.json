    "My muscles felt SO much better after doing this workout! It saves so much time to have the warmup and cool down included!<br><br>I request more:<br>\u2022 20 min full body dumbbell workouts like this (mix of mat and standing workouts) with warmup and cool down included<br>\u2022 20 min full body standing dumbbell workout with warmup and cool down included<br><br>Keep up the good work!",
    "I&#39;ve been doing your workouts since April.  I&#39;m a 46 yo single mom and prior to working out with you I had tried many programs but couldn&#39;t make any stick. I&#39;ve really noticed my muscle mass declining in the last few years, but since doing your workouts I am definitely feeling and seeing a difference!  I really appreciate how they are short and sweet (I&#39;m currently loving your 20 minute workouts), they work the whole body, and there&#39;s so much diversity I never get bored.  My low back issues are much improved now that my glutes/core/lats are stronger (maybe stronger than they&#39;ve ever been?) and I also notice that I&#39;m much stronger on my mountain bike as well.  Your level of instruction is just right for me.  I appreciate your encouragement to modify and your bright smile when the burn starts kicking in!  Thank you so much Mik!  I really appreciate your content.",
    "I have been doing your workouts for about 2 months now, just a couple times a week as an addition to my Yoga practice, and what a difference it has made! I have more energy, and I notice I am stronger in things like side plank and chaturanga...they are becoming easier. Thank you for these video they are really well done and hit just right.",
    "Really love your workouts! So glad I found you! Thanks for making videos for approachable workouts."
