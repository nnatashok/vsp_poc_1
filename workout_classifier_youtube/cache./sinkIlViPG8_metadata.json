  "title": "Full Body Strength Workout With Dumbbells",
  "description": "Today we are slowing things down and increasing our weights in this Full Body Strength Workout with Dumbbells. Added resistance and slow, controlled movements will allow us to focus on building strength and lean muscle - all from home with just a few dumbbells! We will perform 3 rounds of each exercise before moving to the next to make sure we really fatigue each muscle group and feel the burn!! Start with a heavy weight and drop down in weight if you start to notice your form suffering. \n\n\ud83c\udf4eNutrition Guide: https://heatherrobertson.com/shop/ \n\u2b50\ufe0fFree 12 Week Workout Plan: https://bit.ly/3yzAoiO\n\ud83d\uddd3Free Monthly Workout Calendar: https://bit.ly/3bMZGjU\n\ud83c\udfb6My Spotify Playlist: https://spoti.fi/3hKdLiV\n\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc My Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/heatherrobertsoncom\n\n \ud83d\udc5c Shop my Outfits: https://heatherrobertson.com/heathers-picks/ \n\nWorkout Breakdown: Warm Up\n                                      Lower body circuit, upper body circuit, core circuit. 40s work + 20s rest \n                                     * (aim for approx. 12-15 reps per round)\n                                     Cool Down + Stretch \n\nEquipment Needed: dumbbells + exercise mat or other soft surface.
