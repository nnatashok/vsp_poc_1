Phrases like \"work hard,\" \"finish feeling accomplished,\" and the structured format hint at the challenging nature typical of Warrior Workouts.\n\n\"The Progression Quest\" also fits with a confidence of 0.6, as the workout aims at incremental strength improvements through structured trisets with varying weights, appealing to long-term strength gains, as indicated by the user's progress on the EPIC program.\n\nLastly, \"The Masterclass Workout\" with a 0.4 score represents the technique and form focus necessary for executing compound and isolation exercises effectively with proper weight management, as implied by terms like \"isolation exercises\" and \"compound exercises.\" However, this connection is less explicit, reflecting lower confidence."
