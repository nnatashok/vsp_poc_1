  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata of the video suggests a primary classification as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to its description of a 'fat burning HIIT cardio workout' and frequent use of terms like 'boost your metabolism', 'burn calories', and phrases highlighting the workout's intensity such as 'increasing your current resistance'. This is supported by the comments referencing the sweatiness and challenge level, giving this spirit a high confidence score of 0.8. \n\nAdditionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is notable due to the presence of music-driven pacing, as mentioned in the description with a class playlist link, and the workout's seamless transitions between different cycling speeds and movements (e.g., 'sprints', 'climbs', 'jumps'), earning it a 0.6 score. \n\nFinally, 'Structured & Disciplined' is significant because of the methodical 'pyramid structure' approach, progression focus, and explicit instruction to reevaluate and adjust resistance levels, indicative of a structured training approach. This earns it a score of 0.7, reflecting a consistent, disciplined framework throughout the workout. Other spirits were excluded due to lack of relevant indicators in the provided metadata."
