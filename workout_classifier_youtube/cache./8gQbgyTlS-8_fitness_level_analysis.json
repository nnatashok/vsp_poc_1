  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is evaluated as primarily Beginner, supported by the emphasis in the video on basic calisthenics movements: push-ups, squats, and sit-ups, which are simple and straightforward. There is also reference to knee push-ups, a common modification for newcomers. However, a slight Intermediate score is justified by calisthenics requiring some body awareness and coordination, particularly when consistent form is emphasized.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 6:51 minute workout primarily involves bodyweight exercises like push-ups and squats, which are low-to-moderate in energy expenditure, especially if performed at low reps as recommended. The short duration and options for low repetition emphasize a Light effort level, but with potential to reach Moderate for users gradually increasing intensity and reps as suggested.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is clearly aimed at Beginners due to the simplicity and short duration of exercises like push-ups, squats, and sit-ups. The video is explicitly labeled as suitable for 'beginners' in both the title and tags, implying simplicity. However, since calisthenics can be scaled with increased reps and proper form focus, an Intermediate level is also included, acknowledging a slightly higher skill cap if users progress."
