  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves simple floor exercises like supported elbow positions, side lying, and knees/elbows positioning, which are typical in beginner-level pilates and senior workouts. The description and tags emphasize these are beginner and senior-friendly movements. The possibility of adding ankle weights suggests some complexity is possible, slightly increasing the score for intermediate technique.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Despite the video being longer than initially stated, it remains suitable for light effort difficulty due to the low-impact pilates movements without equipment, as mentioned in the description and tags. Comments by users enjoying a moderate challenge and burning sensation slightly elevate the effort to moderate but still very manageable given the varying intensity options (e.g., ankle weights).",
