  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video, titled '10 MIN PERFECT ABS WORKOUT (NO EQUIPMENT BODYWEIGHT WORKOUT!)', is tailored for those seeking a high-intensity engagement with rapid, challenging exercises, a typical trait of the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. Key phrases from the metadata such as 'ripped', 'lose weight', 'shredded', and 'motivation', paired with the description's emphasis on training a full range core, support this orientation. The duration and viewership further suggest a widely adopted energetic routine. This is scored at 0.75 due to strong signals without clear pacing details.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit emerges from the precise technical approach described in targeting different core components like the rectus abdominus and obliques with specified exercises ('Scissors Leg Raise', 'Leg Raise to Hip Up'). Multiple users emphasize regular engagement with the workout, further indicating structured, disciplined practice. This spirit scores 0.7 as the breakdown into parts and regimented sequences suggest a methodological framework."
