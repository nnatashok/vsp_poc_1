    "I was actually crying during this medation just because for once today I felt so free and I appreciated myself. That is something that I have been really struggeling with these past few weeks. I am putting so much pressure on myself to the point that I\u2019m suffocating in it in my own thoughts. But today I just let go and let myself just feel everything inside me and I\u2019m really gratefull for that so Thank you \u2764\ufe0f",

    "I wasn&#39;t in my body when I was in the forest. I was a ribbon of pure energy. Tears of healing washing over my face have become an accepted part of these meditations. These meditations truly reach a level of self acceptance I have yearned for. Thank you. Hug.",
