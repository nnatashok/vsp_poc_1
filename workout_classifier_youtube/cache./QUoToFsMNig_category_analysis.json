  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is 'Indoor biking' with a score of 1.0, as evidenced by the title '30 Minute HIIT Cardio Indoor Cycling Workout' and repeated references to cycling in the description, tags, and channel information. The channel specializes in cycling workouts, further reinforcing this category. 'HIIT' is chosen as a secondary category with a score of 0.8, indicated by the explicit mention of 'interval', 'HIIT', and 'High-Intensity Interval Training' in the tags and description. The detailed session plan outlines short, intense efforts with recovery periods, a hallmark of HIIT training. There is no indication of any other workout type present, such as mat exercises or weight training, thus those categories were not selected. The confidence level is very high given the clear and focused nature of the metadata pointing strongly towards indoor biking and HIIT."
