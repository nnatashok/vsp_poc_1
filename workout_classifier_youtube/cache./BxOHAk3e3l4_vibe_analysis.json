  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe 'The Reboot Workout' is strongly supported by the description and tags emphasizing a full body stretch routine designed to improve mobility and flexibility, such as 'Full body stretch', 'Daily Stretch Routine', and 'Pre/Post Workout Stretch'. This is indicative of a workout that focuses on recovery, low stress, and a total-body refresh. The score of 0.85 reflects strong alignment with these characteristics.\n\n'The Zen Flow' vibe is also relevant due to the routine's grounding, intentional approach to stretching\u2014evidenced by phrases like 'ease your way into a deeper stretch without any strain' and 'customizable', which suggests a relaxed and breath-centered flow. It scores 0.65 due to its partial fit with slow-flow yoga or mobility training.\n\nThe 'Comfort Moves' vibe is included with a score of 0.5 based on user comments highlighting the comfort and suitability for older age groups and its compatibility with a relaxed morning routine, hinting at safe, cozy, and feel-good movements.\n\nWhile there is some overlap with 'The Zen Flow', the more dynamic and movement-oriented aspects of the routine steer it away from primarily meditative exercises, which is why this vibe is not ranked higher. Overall, the classification has high confidence with robust metadata support."
