  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled 'Guided Abundance Meditation | Bob Proctor' from Mindvalley is clearly centered around meditation, with an emphasis on tranquility and visualization, aligning strongly with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The description invites viewers to sit back and relax into visualizations, and the video duration of 21:53 suggests a slow and deliberate pace characteristic of 'The Zen Flow'. The tags like 'guided meditation for anxiety' and 'meditation for stress and anxiety' further reinforce this relaxed, grounding experience, which is typical for 'The Zen Flow'. Therefore, this vibe is assigned a high score of 0.95.\n\nThe secondary vibe, 'The Deep Recharge', is reflected in the promise of calming the mind and stress relief, as noted in the description and user comments. Comments emphasize transformation and calming energies, indicative of a nervous system reset, thus scoring a 0.7 for 'The Deep Recharge'. Other potential vibes, such as 'The Sleep Prep', were excluded due to the lack of specific sleep preparation mentioned despite some elements pointing to relaxation."
