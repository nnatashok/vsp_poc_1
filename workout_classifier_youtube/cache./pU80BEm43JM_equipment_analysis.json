  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Guided Meditation for Anxiety | The Hourglass' by the Priory channel is clearly focused on providing a meditation experience specifically designed to alleviate anxiety. There is no indication in the title, description, or tags that any specific equipment is required for this meditation session. The content and language used are focused on mental health and mindfulness, typical for a meditation practice, which generally does not use physical workout equipment. The comments also do not mention or suggest the need for any equipment, and instead emphasize the positive effects of the meditation itself. Therefore, based on the available metadata, this meditation video appears to be designed for a bodyweight-only experience, which means no equipment is necessary."
