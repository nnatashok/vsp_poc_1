  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves indoor cycling, which generally includes basic pedaling techniques that are simple for beginners. However, the interval nature may require some coordination to maintain form during high-intensity phases, suggesting an intermediate level as well. Beginner and intermediate scores are warranted due to the emphasis on technique during intervals, which might challenge balance and coordination slightly but not to a highly complex degree.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a '30 minute HIIT' session designed for 'burning fat' and building '30 second max effort.' With such intensity and the interval nature of cycling, the workout likely requires moderate to challenging effort for most users, especially those who are less fit. The mention of sprinting and 30-second max efforts supports a challenging classification but remains accessible for those with some base fitness level.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulties, the required fitness levels include a range from beginner to advanced. While indoor cycling is accessible to beginners, the HIIT format and the need to sustain high-effort intervals elevate this workout to better suit intermediate users. The comments indicate adaptability, with beginners like one commenter starting the workout to improve fitness over time, transitioning to advanced repetition. The 30-minute duration of a HIIT session caters to intermediate to advanced fitness levels but can be adjusted for beginners by moderating intensity."
