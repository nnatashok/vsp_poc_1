  "vibesExplanation": "The video is identified as a spin class featuring Tabata drills and power surges, along with endurance building, which suggests a strong 'Endorphin Wave' vibe due to the elevated energy and feel-good movement. This is supported by user comments praising the music, motivation, and the energetic class structure (confidence 0.75). The presence of Tabata, a high-intensity interval training method, introduces elements of 'The Firestarter' vibe, characterized by its fast, explosive nature (confidence 0.7). The upbeat and uplifting music mentioned in the comments and the channel's focus on creating a positive workout experience also suggest 'The Groove Session' vibe, although it plays a more moderate role in the overall experience (confidence 0.5). This blend creates a dynamic, energetic workout environment that balances focused intensity with a pleasurable experience."
