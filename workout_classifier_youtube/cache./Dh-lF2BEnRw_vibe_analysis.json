This classification is supported by phrases like 'lazy girl workout,' 'gentle,' and 'low impact workout' highlighted in the title and description. These terms suggest a workout that is safe, cozy, and accessible, designed to be done while watching TV from the comfort of a couch, appealing to individuals of varying fitness levels as reflected in user comments discussing ease and accessibility for those not regularly active. \n\nThe secondary vibe 'The Reboot Workout' with a score of 0.7 fits due to the workout's intention as a 'gentle morning wake up workout' and 'just enough to make you productive,' indicating that it's designed as a total-body refresh that energizes lightly, linked to comments describing how it encourages movement and productivity.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Zen Flow' were excluded as the workout lacks the repetitiveness or breath-centered focus, while more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' don't align with the low-impact, gentle nature characterized in the workout's presentation and user experience."
