  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Low impact, high intensity intermediate home cardio workout' suggests it's a cardio workout primarily focused on low-impact exercises that do not require specific equipment. The title emphasizes 'home cardio' and 'low impact,' indicating exercises that might be done with bodyweight alone. The description and tags such as 'low impact,' 'cardio,' 'home exercise,' and 'exercise from home' support this, suggesting the workout can be performed without equipment. Additionally, the comments from users emphasize the experience and emotional motivation without mentioning any specific equipment used, reinforcing the likelihood that the workout is bodyweight-based. There is no direct mention of equipment in the title, description, or comments. Therefore, the workout appears to be designed to use only bodyweight, and no equipment is required."
