  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is primarily beginner-friendly, with low-impact exercises suitable for deconditioned individuals. Comments from users who are generally out of shape but completed the workout indicate accessibility at a beginner level. The inclusion of yoga may require minimal previous exposure, which raises the intermediate level score slightly. The duration of the video is longer than 20 minutes, which may present a challenge for complete beginners, hence a moderate consideration of intermediate level inclusion."
