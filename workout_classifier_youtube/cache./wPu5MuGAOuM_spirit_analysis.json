  "spiritsExplanation": "The video represents a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, evident from the focus on stretching, improving mobility, and the healing aspect of addressing bodily stiffness, as noted in the title and comments. The description emphasizes integrating warm-ups, and a methodical approach, which supports stress reduction and recovery. The high confidence score (0.8) reflects this clear emphasis on soothing the body and relieving tension. There is also a 'Structured & Disciplined' component, as viewers noted the scientific and methodological approach to mobility, detailed instruction against the wall, and the progressive nature of the 30-day challenge. This suggests an organized, educational setup, with a score of 0.6 to indicate the secondary significance of this spirit. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were not relevant here due to the focus on slow, restorative stretching rather than dynamic or athletic activities."
