  "vibesExplanation": "The workout vibe 'The Explorer's Workout' is assigned a score of 0.8 due to the vivid description and emphasis on a 'scenic virtual stair climb' through Chimney Rock in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The title, tags, and description highlight the adventure-like quality and the enjoyment of scenic views, which are foundational to this vibe category. The use of phrases like 'virtual hike,' 'scenic climb,' and 'take in views of up to 75 miles' strongly supports this classification.\n\n'On the Meditative Grind' is given a score of 0.6, reflecting the structured, endurance-style treadmill experience offered by climbing 500 stair steps as described. The video's repetitive and steady nature aligns with the meditative aspect of this vibe. The insight from comments about users tailoring the pace to match their workout further supports its methodical grind, indicative of a gradual endurance challenge.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' were excluded due to lack of emphasis on relaxation, breath-work, or a strong musical component."
