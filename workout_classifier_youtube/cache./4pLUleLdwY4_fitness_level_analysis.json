  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is classified as 'Beginner' with high confidence due to the nature of the video focusing on a simple meditation practice. The description highlights a 'simple at home meditation' which is designed to 'provide relief from anxiety.' The tags such as 'meditation for beginners' and 'breathing techniques' emphasize a straightforward, accessible practice with minimal movements required. There are no indications of complex physical or coordination demands, aligning with beginner-level criteria.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.95,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is assessed as 'Light' due to the nature of the workout being a meditation session rather than a physically demanding activity. The title 'Meditation for Anxiety' and description emphasize seated posture and breath awareness, which require low physical exertion. The session duration is 14 minutes, further supporting this classification as it involves minimal to no physical activity beyond maintaining a comfortable seated position.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner' due to the meditation focus, supportive tags like 'meditation for beginners,' and general encouragement for 'all levels.' However, given adjustments needed for maintaining posture and breath control, 'Intermediate' and 'Advanced' levels are included to address users who may face difficulties with breath focus and mindfulness. Since meditation can be mentally challenging, varying experience in meditation practices can affect engagement and experience, justifying the inclusion of multiple levels. Nonetheless, the primary target and design is aimed at beginners."
