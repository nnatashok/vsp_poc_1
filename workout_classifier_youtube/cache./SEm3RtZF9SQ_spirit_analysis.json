  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is best classified under 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.8, as evidenced by the detailed breakdown of circuits and exercises structured with specific timing (30 seconds exercise, 60 seconds rest), which indicates a methodical and systematic approach. The mention of 'beginner to expert' further suggests a progression in difficulty. \nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit also applies, though to a slightly lesser degree, with a score of 0.6. This is supported by elements like 'burn fat', 'ripped', 'shredded', and exercise types such as push-ups, jumping-squats, and high knees, which suggest a focus on intensity and exertion. The inclusion of comments discussing physical challenges and endurance also reinforces this. \nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are not applicable here due to the focus on strength, intensity, and structure, with little indication of smooth, music-driven pacing or relaxation emphasis."
