    "I&#39;m a severe asthmatic and I&#39;ve been trying to find a beginner friendly full body routine to get back into the swing of things and this is perfect",
    "Wow! This doesn&#39;t seem like enough, but I always overdo it and don&#39;t come back the next day. This is perfect just to get motion back into my everyday routine!! This was day 2. I feel so good after this, I love it!",
    "This is great for people with busy schedules you can always find 5 minutes and it&#39;s nice you have the timer right there",
    "I swear it feels like the clock is going backwards on planks",
    "Thank you for these 5 mins workouts. I have been doing your shoulder and neck videos for 4 days now and am feeling the difference already. Your way of presenting and performing the exercises yourself is motivating. Looking forward to more workout videos\ud83d\ude0a"
