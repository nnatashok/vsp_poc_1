  "categoriesExplanation": "The video \"15 Min Daily Yoga Routine for Beginners (Follow Along)\" is primarily a yoga video, as explicitly stated in the title and description. It includes a series of yoga postures and sequences such as Sun Salutations and various asanas like Pawanmuktasana and Naukaasana. This justifies the highest score of 1.0 for the Yoga category. The detailed focus on pranayama and other breathing techniques such as Bhastrika and Kapalbhati indicates a strong emphasis on breathing exercises, meriting a score of 0.7 for this category. The description and segments on Aum chanting and Pranayama suggest elements of mindfulness and calming techniques, which is why Meditation receives a score of 0.4. Other categories were excluded due to a lack of relevant content, reinforcing the classification's confidence."
