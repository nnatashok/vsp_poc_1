  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled '15 min Gentle Yoga for Flexibility & Stress Reduction' on 'Yoga with Kassandra' channel primarily embodies 'The Reboot Workout' and 'The Zen Flow'. The title and description emphasize a \"gentle yoga flow,\" \"full body stretches,\" and stress relief, indicating a calming and restorative experience typical of 'The Reboot Workout.' The mention of \"gentle soothing yoga class\" and \"great for all experience levels\" further supports this classification. The inclusion of pranayama or breathwork, specifically \"Box Breath - Sama Vritti Pranayama,\" signifies intentional, breath-centered practice, aligning perfectly with 'The Zen Flow.' Tags like \"yoga for stress,\" \"yoga for anxiety,\" and \"therapeutic yoga\" reinforce a focus on relaxation and stress reduction, typical of both vibes. The channel's consistent emphasis on beginner-friendly and restorative practices provides additional confidence in these classifications, thus warranting scores of 0.85 for both vibes. Other potential vibes related to intensity or entertainment were excluded due to the explicit emphasis on relaxation and gentle movement."
