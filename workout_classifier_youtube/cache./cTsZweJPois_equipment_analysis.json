  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for this video explicitly indicates that a mat is needed. The video title mentions \"At-Home Mat Pilates (No Equipment),\" suggesting that while no additional equipment is necessary, a mat is still implied as essential for the exercises. This is further supported in the description where a mat from Liforme is mentioned, along with a discount code, indicating the presenter's promotion and endorsement of using a mat. Therefore, based on these references, the confidence level for requiring a mat is very high (0.9). Other equipment is not mentioned, supporting that the workout is essentially bodyweight-focused apart from the mat."
