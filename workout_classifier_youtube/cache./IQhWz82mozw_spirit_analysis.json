  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit assigned to this workout is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.95. This is strongly supported by the title '20 Minute Rhythm Cycling Class - 90s Pop Ride' which highlights rhythm and music as key components. The channel is described as 'THE ULTIMATE RHYTHM CYCLING EXPERIENCE', emphasizing the focus on music-driven and coordinated movement, which are hallmarks of Flow & Rhythm workouts. The comments also reflect a strong engagement with the music and rhythm, indicating participants experience a mind-body connection ('Spinners high').\n\nA secondary spirit identified is 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.7. Although the workout timeframe (20 minutes) suggests intensity, the high engagement as exhibited in the comments ('burn calories', 'lost weight', 'spinners high') supports the presence of a high-energy aspect, likely due to the motivational nature of cycling and 90s pop music.\n\nThe focus on structured guidance or technical precision is not explicitly mentioned, thus 'Structured & Disciplined' was excluded. The absence of any recovery or relaxation focus excludes 'Soothing & Restorative'."
