  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized primarily under 'Calisthenics' with high confidence (score: 0.9) because the title explicitly includes 'Calisthenics Workout' and the channel description emphasizes calisthenics as a key focus. The tags also reinforce this, listing 'calisthenics for beginners' and 'female calisthenics.' Furthermore, 'Beginner At Home Calisthenics Workout' in the title highlights calisthenics as the core activity.\n\nThe 'Body weight' category is also highly relevant (score: 0.8) as the workout is performed 'No Equipment' and is described as a 'bodyweight workout' in the tags ('full body beginners bodyweight workout'). This aligns with common bodyweight exercises used in calisthenics.\n\nNo equipment is mentioned, ensuring these categories are most fitting for exercises performed using only body resistance. Other categories like 'Weight workout' are excluded due to the explicit 'no equipment' designation."
