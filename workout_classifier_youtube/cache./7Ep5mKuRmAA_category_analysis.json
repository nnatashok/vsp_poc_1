  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Breathing exercises' with a high score of 0.9 due to explicit references to 'belly breathing exercise' in both the title and description. The focus of the video on calming the body and mind through a specific breathing technique strongly supports this classification.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Meditation' with a score of 0.7. This is supported by the video's intent to reduce stress and anxiety, a common goal in meditation practices. Comments such as feeling calm after following the exercise further reinforce the meditative quality of the content. Although the primary activity is breathing, the context and outcomes align well with meditation practices.\n\nOther categories like 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were excluded because the video does not involve physical postures or flexibility training, focusing solely on breathing and relaxation."
