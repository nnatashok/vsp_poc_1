  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is primarily characterized by its focus on stretching, flexibility, and mobility targeting beginners, as indicated by the title '10 minute Stretching Routine I Beginner FOLLOW ALONG'. This routine closely matches 'The Reboot Workout' vibe due to its emphasis on total body refreshment, gentle movements, and stress relief, which is supported by tags and descriptions like 'back pain relief exercises' and 'full body flexibility routine'. The score of 0.9 for 'The Reboot Workout' is justified by its perfect alignment with the reboot and refresh attributes.\n\nThe inclusion of 'beginner friendly', 'full body stretch', and 'follow along' suggests a welcoming, accessible format that fits 'The Comfort Moves', scoring 0.65, as it's designed to be approachable and beneficial for those new to exercise or seeking gentle movement.\n\nFinally, there are elements of 'The Zen Flow' due to the structured, calming nature of stretching and focus on body awareness and breath, leading to a score of 0.6. However, this isn't the primary emphasis, hence a lower score compared to the main vibes. The commentary about it being 'simple' and 'well guided' supports this classification."
