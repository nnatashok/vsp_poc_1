  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is explicitly described as a cardio workout that requires no equipment. The title, description, and several tags such as \"No Equipment,\" \"cardio no equipment,\" and \"equipment free cardio\" emphasize that this workout is designed to be performed without any equipment, making it suitable for at-home or apartment-friendly settings. The video's description further reiterates this by stating \"No equipment needed.\" Additionally, although there is a mention of a mat in the description, it is in the context of a personal recommendation rather than a requirement for the workout. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, and no equipment is required."
