    "5 months ago I left a comment here about bursting into tears after completing this workout. This was because this workout made me understand how out of shape I was due to having given up on my healthy habits (including physical exercise) because of work stress. Today, 5 months later I did this workout again and would now like to give an update.<br>It took some time but 2 months ago I finally turned my life around and started working out every single day. Not much, just 10-25 minutes a time. Sometimes it&#39;s a similar workout to this, other days a bit of yoga or just stretching. I feel so much better and happier now! My body doesn&#39;t hurt anymore. I don&#39;t struggle walking the stairs anymore. I feel a bit more like my old self.<br>This workout is still challenging for me (my arms are shaking right now lol) but it&#39;s manageable!<br>If you&#39;re feeling down and/or uncomfortable in your body then just know that 10-15 minutes can make a big difference in your life! :) Good luck!",
    "I used to exercise regularly and be quite fit. However, a lot has changed and today I could barely finish this workout. After completing it I burst into tears - on the one hand because I was happy and proud for exercising after such a long break but also because I was miserable about having lost most of my muscle tone and endurance. So in case anyone needs this reminder: If your work stress or some other stress is so bad that you don&#39;t have time or energy for your healthy habits anymore, it&#39;s time to make a change! Your health is your most precious asset!",
    "I love that she&#39;s also showing what NOT to do - as someone who is a total beginner and exercising alone, I&#39;m always doubting whether I&#39;m doing things correctly and her showing what to keep an eye on helps tremendously.",
