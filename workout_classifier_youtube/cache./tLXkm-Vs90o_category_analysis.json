Furthermore, user comments speak highly about the effectiveness and routine use of the breathwork practice, specifically pointing out its utility in calming and energizing ('calm and present energy', 'about the skill of breathwork'). There is no mention of physical exercise, equipment use, or other fitness modalities, confirming a strong score for 'Breathing exercises' at 0.95. The chosen category reflects the emphasis on breath as the central element rather than a specific fitness activity or physical training. Other categories are excluded due to the absence of such activities in the metadata."
