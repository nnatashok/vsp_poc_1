  "categoriesExplanation": "The selected categories of 'Yoga' and 'Stretching' are based on several indicators from the metadata. The title 'Bedtime Yoga Stretch to Release Tension and Stress' directly mentions 'Yoga' and 'Stretch', suggesting that this is a yoga-centered routine with a focus on flexibility. The channel name 'Yoga With Bird' and the detailed description emphasize the yoga practice, aligning it with relaxation and stress relief. Tags such as 'bedtime yoga stretch', 'yoga for stress', and 'restorative yoga' further reinforce the yoga aspect. Given the description of the routine as 'super gentle' and aimed at relaxing the body and mind, the 'Stretching' category also fits well, as it involves exercises to enhance flexibility and release tension. User comments highlight emotional relief and mental relaxation, typical outcomes of yoga and stretching exercises. The high scores reflect the strong and clear focus on yoga and stretching, supported by descriptive and contextual evidence. Other categories like 'Meditation' were considered, but the primary emphasis on physical practice led these to be excluded."
