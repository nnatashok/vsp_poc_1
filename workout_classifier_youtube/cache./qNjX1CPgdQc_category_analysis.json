  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Indoor biking' with a high confidence score of 0.95. This is explicitly indicated by terms such as '30 Minute Spin\u00ae Class', 'Indoor Cycling Workout', and repeated mentions of 'spin class', 'indoor cycling', and 'exercise bike workout' in the title, description, and tags, suggesting a focus on stationary cycling. The video is designed for all levels, particularly beginners, as highlighted in the title and the description. \n\nThe category 'HIIT' is included with a lower score of 0.2, as the description mentions components like 'hills, sprints, and jumps', which could imply a form of interval training. However, since the primary focus is on cycling as a beginner-friendly workout, HIIT elements seem to be minor and not the central theme of the class. Additionally, comments and channel information support this by emphasizing the indoor biking experience and not focusing on high-intensity intervals. Other categories like 'Body weight' or 'Calisthenics' are excluded as there is no mention of exercises beyond cycling."
