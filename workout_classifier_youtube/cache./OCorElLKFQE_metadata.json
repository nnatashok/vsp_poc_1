  "title": "5 Minute Guided Meditation for Gratitude | Mindful Movement",
  "description": "Take 5 minutes out of your busy day to practice the meditation for gratitude.  It is a great guided meditation for first thing in the morning or last thing before you drift off to sleep.\n\nCan you sense the peaceful energy of life flowing through you, invigorating you with each breath? You are the embodiment of this lively energy. Your body is a miracle and a gift, the vehicle through which you have the privilege of experiencing this beautiful world. \n\nI challenge you to continue cultivating gratitude throughout your day. Perhaps you can even find something positive out of an experience that seems negative at first glance. \n\nMeditation written by Mollie Raymond and read by Sara Raymond\nMusic Credit:  Serenity by Chris Collins, indiemusicbox.com  \n\nSara's Book\nYou Are Not Broken: A compassionate guide to uncovering inner wisdom and transforming your life with hypnotherapy\nhttps://amzn.to/3CUdABJ\n---------------------------------------------\n1:1 Sessions\nPERSONALIZED HYPNOTHERAPY & TRANSFORMATIONAL COACHING\nhttps://www.themindfulmovement.com/sara\n---------------------------------------------\nDo not listen while driving. Meditation and mindful movement are powerful tools to support you. This is not a substitute for medical care. Consult a doctor or trusted health professional if needed.\n\n#gratitude  #meditation  #guidedmeditation",
