    "I love your workouts! I do 5-6 of your workouts each week and after a year I am down a full clothing size! I don\u2019t have a scale in my home but I do know that I feel so healthy and strong. Thank you so much for being a part of my routine and helping me keep my body healthy!",
    "Hi!  Your workouts are great and this is another great one.  I\u2019m 54 years old and I love the pace of these workouts. It is very doable and I love the modifications just in case I need it. Which sometimes for a certain move I do.  I have tried all different kinds of your workouts and I love them.  Between your workouts and my spin bike I\u2019m hoping to keep it strong during menopause.  \u2764",
    "\u2764 I am back with 6, 7.5, and 9.5 kg. And thank you for the class \u2764",
    "Things I love about your videos:<br>Your calm, sweet voice<br>No repeats<br>Abs<br>*Really everything \ud83e\udef6 Thank you",
    "Thank you. These workouts are perfect for me. I combine these exercises with my regular yoga practice. People around me are noticing the difference. I feel wonderful after these workouts. God bless you and your family!!! \ud83c\udf89"
