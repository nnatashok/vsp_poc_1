  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled \"GET STRONG\" Best Core Exercises For Kids focuses on strengthening the core, which aligns with a moderate match to \"The Warrior Workout\" vibe (score: 0.55), as it provides an energetic, strength-focused routine suitable for young participants. The duration of 15 minutes and the inclusion of HIIT elements, as indicated in the tags, suggest a dynamic and well-paced session, aligning somewhat with a warrior-like intensity but tailored for kids.\n\n\"The Groove Session\" (score: 0.45) is considered due to the channel's emphasis on making workouts fun and engaging for children. The use of music from Epidemic Sound and the overall channel theme of creativity and laughter contributes to a session that might feel playful and fluid.\n\nThe \"Meditative Grind\" (score: 0.4) vibe is included at a lower confidence level due to the repetitive nature of core exercises, providing a focus that children can follow to improve performance gradually. The instructional approach by Vivien adds a layer of focus.\n\nPotential vibes like \"The Nightclub Workout\" or \"The Adrenaline Rush\" were excluded due to the lack of intensity and club-like music atmosphere typically found in adult-based HIIT or dance sessions."
