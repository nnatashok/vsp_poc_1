  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.7. Evidence includes the focus on cardio, obliques, and lower body exercises mentioned in the description, indicating a fast-paced and heart-pumping session to target specific areas. The mention of including cardio fits the high-energy profile. User comments corroborate this, noting significant results from consistent, intense efforts.\n\nA secondary classification of 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.6 is suggested by the continuous structure of the workout, where exercises like side crunches and leg raises transition smoothly into one another, often accompanied by music from Epidemic Sound, which implies a rhythmic, paced routine. This structure allows maintaining a steady flow, aligning with the mind-body connection typically emphasized in rhythm-based workouts.\n\nThe presence of these elements makes other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' inappropriate, as the focus isn't on relaxation or nature, respectively. The structured exercises also preclude a pure 'Structured & Disciplined' classification, as the workout lacks technical precision focus."
