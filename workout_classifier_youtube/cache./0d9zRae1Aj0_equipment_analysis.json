  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for the video titled 'Standing Pilates Cardio & Abs Workout | 20 Min Dance Inspired Workout' suggests that no specific equipment is required for this workout. The video is explicitly tagged with terms such as 'full body workout no equipment' and 'standing workout no jumping,' indicating a focus on bodyweight exercises. The description emphasizes low impact, concentration-based movements without any mention of using equipment. Additionally, user comments and tags reinforce the idea that this is a bodyweight-only session. Therefore, based on this evidence, we conclude that the workout can be effectively performed without any equipment."
