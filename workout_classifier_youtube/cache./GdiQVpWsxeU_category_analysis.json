  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Breathing exercises' with a high confidence score of 0.9. The title, description, and tags all emphasize the practice of breathwork, explicitly indicating that it is a core part of the video. Words like 'breathwork routine,' 'breathing exercises,' and related tags such as 'pranayama' strongly support this classification.\n\n'Meditation' is a relevant secondary category with a score of 0.7. While the focus is on breathwork, the intention of this practice includes achieving mental benefits like reduced anxiety and increased mindfulness, which aligns with meditative practices. The descriptions of self-discovery, insight, and clarity further imply a meditative aspect.\n\n'Yoga' has a lower score of 0.4 due to its presence in the tags like 'beginnersyoga' and 'yoga,' although it is primarily mentioned in a context associated with breathwork. This suggests a mild connection but not the center of the video's focus.\n\nOther categories like 'Stretching' or 'Body weight' were excluded as there is no indication of physical movement or exercises beyond breath control. The consistent messaging around breath control and mental wellness justifies the assigned scores."
