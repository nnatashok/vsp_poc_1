  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit was identified with high confidence (0.8 score) due to the workout's clear and methodical approach, showcased by precise timing and speed intervals, as detailed in the description and 'WORKOUT DETAILS'. The workout is designed for beginners, following a systematic increase in speed with intervals, and includes a warm-up and cooldown period, indicating a structured routine. Additionally, the video is provided by 'Sunny Health & Fitness', a channel known for educational content on technique and exercise routines, further supporting this classification.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit was identified with moderate confidence (0.5 score) because the workout is positioned for beginners and emphasizes progression and proper form over intensity, as seen in user comments appreciating its approachable nature for individuals starting or adapting fitness routines. This suggests elements of stress reduction and gentle introduction to exercise, though not the primary focus.\n\nOther spirits were less relevant. High intensity is not present due to its beginner focus and lower speeds. 'Flow & Rhythm', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' did not match due to lack of music-driven elements, sports specificity or outdoor context."
