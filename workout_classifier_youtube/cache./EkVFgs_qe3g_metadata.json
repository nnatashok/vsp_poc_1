  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "Hey, everyone who loves Nicole and her videos! Let\u2019s let the ads play after we do her amazing workouts. Ads are how YouTubers get paid for their work, and Nicole obviously doesn\u2019t have mid-roll ads, so letting ads play when we\u2019re done is the best way we can say thank you! \u2764",
    "Hello Nicole, I\u2019m a 58 year old woman in London. I\u2019m one of the hundreds of thousands of people who\u2019ve been following you and doing your classes quietly. I was looking to substitute my live Pilates classes with an online alternative when we went into lockdown early last year, but didn\u2019t like to come back repeatedly to any teacher until I found your channel. I\u2019m not going back to live classes now, as your classes are just so mindblowingly good: always gentle but challenging, never boring, so many variations of moves... and such positivity, that it\u2019s impossible to leave your class anything but feeling stronger in both body and mind. THANK YOU for uploading such brilliant classes so consistently and free of charge. I love doing them and they keep me well. Happy new year to you &amp; yours!",
    "Hope you enjoy this new Pilates HIIT class with weights! \ud83d\ude0a I am using 1kg weights.<br><br>I would also like to say a big thank you to you all for moving with me this year, it really means the world to me. Sending you lots of love and wishing you a Happy New Year! \u2764",
    "Can\u2019t believe I worked up a sweat in a 15 Pilates workout! Thank you Nicole",
    "These under-30-minutes, total-body sweats are just what I need! Thank you \ud83d\ude0a"
