  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is clearly focused on a 'Lightweight Dumbbell Bicep & Forearm Workout' as indicated by the title and repeatedly in the description and tags. It explicitly refers to using dumbbells, suggesting a primary categorization of 'Weight workout' with a score of 1, as the exercises involve equipment-based strength training. The listed exercises such as the 'Double Bicep Curl' and 'Wrist x Hammer Curl' all involve dumbbells and target muscle building and conditioning. The focus on the biceps and forearms rules out categories like 'Body weight' that typically involve no equipment, although the emphasis on lightweight could imply some degree of crossover into body weight focus given the simplicity and accessibility of the workout; however, equipment is still essential here, leading to its secondary nature, justifying a score of 0.2 for 'Body weight'. Other categories such as 'Pilates', 'Calisthenics', or 'HIIT' are not applicable as these methods or high intensity formats are not mentioned or relevant to the session structure."
