  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"Soothing & Restorative\" due to key elements in the title and description such as \"relaxing,\" \"mobility,\" \"flexibility,\" and terms like \"full body stretch.\" The focus on stretching tight muscles, the gentle nature of stretching, and recommendations to incorporate the session into daily routines suggest a strong recovery and relaxation focus, underscored by high confidence (0.9) in this spirit. Additionally, comments like \"soft and sweet song in the background\" highlight a relaxing environment further confirming this classification.\n\n\"Flow & Rhythm\" is selected as a secondary spirit, albeit with a lower score (0.7), due to the continuous nature of stretching routines, implied by tags such as \"yoga,\" \"quick stretch yoga,\" and phrases in the description suggesting a smooth addition to daily activities. This points to a moderately strong connection to rhythm and fluidity. The lack of intense or structured language, especially absent any high-intensity or technical regimen descriptions, makes \"High-Energy & Intense,\" \"Structured & Disciplined,\" \"Sport & Agility,\" and \"Outdoor & Adventure\" inappropriate for this workout."
