  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout predominantly embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit as it emphasizes gentle and healing-focused mobility exercises. The title and description stress improving mobility through a daily stretch routine, using phrases like \"5 min stretch routine,\" \"loosen up the spine,\" and \"gentle motion.\" The exercises like 'Cat Cow' and the stretching focus confirm its restorative nature. Comments highlight improvements in flexibility and overall body feeling, indicating the restorative effects of the workout. The spirit 'Structured & Disciplined' is evident as the routine is methodical, following a specific sequence targeting key areas (hips, back, ankles). The description provides detailed steps for each exercise, emphasizing technical precision and consistency ('daily stretch routine' and laid out exercise steps). 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'High-Energy & Intense' were not applicable because this routine primarily targets flexibility rather than quick or intense movement. Overall, the classification is confident due to the explicit focus on restorative stretching and structured guidance."
