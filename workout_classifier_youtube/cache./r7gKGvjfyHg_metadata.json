  "title": "10 MIN AB COMPLEX | Total Abs Workout - NO EQUIPMENT",
  "description": "This 10 min abs workout is a perfect finisher to any workout or great for active rest days along side cardio!\n\nPlease remember... ab specific workouts will not reduce fat from the tummy area. Ab and core workouts strengthen the entire core and allow for improved definition depending on body fat levels and where fat is stored.\n\nI know you have all heard abs are made in the kitchen...rather they are revealed relating to your body fat percentage and this can be different for everyone. In regards \u2018the kitchen\u2019 this relates to your calorie intake versus calories burned. To lose body fat, you must be burn more than you intake; this can be done through your nutritional intake and/or increasing cardio! \n\nIt is better to reduce calories very slightly so you have energy to continue to train... and cardio will increase your energy expenditure so I would definitely recommend considering how to implement for cardio into your day/week. It could be a walk daily, a run twice per week, cardio workout at home that is steady state (as apposed to stopping and starting), rather keeping that heart rate steady increased pace if you are aiming to reduce body fat. Paired with strength training to burn calories (heart rate is elevated during points and muscle increases your metabolism!) and HIIT (much higher spikes in heart rate). \n\nKeep up the super training everyone!! \n\nAll you will need for this ab workout is your mat!\n\nX20\nTABLE TOP CRUNCH\nCRUNCH PULSES\n\nX10\nHIP RAISE\nGAZE DOWN LEG LOWER\n\nX10\nON ELBOWS TUCK TO EXTENSION\nHANDS AT HEAD SIT UP\n\nX10\nSIDE PLANK OBLIQUE LIFTS\nSIDE PLANK OBLIQUE LIFTS\n\nI hope you enjoy this routine... perfect to incorporate anytime on its own or post main workout!\n\nEmbrace the burn!! \n\nCx\n\n\u25b6 My Instagram: https://instagram.com/carolinegirvan\n\u25b6 Subscribe to my Fitness Channel for FREE: https://youtube.com/c/carolinegirvan/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nExtras:\n\n\u25b6 My 30 Min LISS Cardio Workout: https://youtu.be/ImI63BUUPwU\n\u25b6 My 15 Min Rock Hard Abs Workout: https://youtu.be/cS-bIr-6hQM\n\nEquipment I use in my other workouts:\n\n\u25b6 My Amazon UK Page: https://amazon.co.uk/shop/carolinegirvan\n\u25b6 My Amazon US Page: https://amazon.com/shop/carolinegirvan\n\nEPIC Program:\n\n\u25b6 Caroline Girvan FREE 10 Week Program Guide: https://carolinegirvan.com\n\u25b6 Official EPIC Program Apparel: https://teespring.com/stores/carolinegirvan\n\u25b6 The EPIC Program Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu1QCKrfgPW3VAMHM-wefcO4ZyXf6cwt\n\u25b6 The EPIC Beginner Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu1QCKrfgPUZ7_HDxP8P_-0ffNoobSDH\n\nBusiness Enquiries:\n\n\u25b6 Email: info@carolinegirvan.com\n\nCaroline Girvan \nPO BOX 115\n\nCounty Antrim \nNorthern Ireland \nBT38 8WB\n\n\nDisclaimer: If you are new to exercise or planning on embarking on a new fitness programme, you should consult your physician.

    "The thing is... this is meant as an after workout &quot;finisher&quot; while I use it as a full workout session..",
    "I feel like Caroline is turning into some type of  guardian Angel \ud83d\ude05. Every time I need her workouts she is there \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f. I was looking at previous abs workouts we did during the epic program, and now here she is with a brand new one\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17",
    "(Monday, 18th Jan 2021) I decided I am going to do this work out first thing in the morning for at least one week! I still have troubles with some of the exercises (especially from the 2nd set) and I want to get strong enough to do them properly!\ud83d\udd25 +it\u2019s a great 10 min work out that will surely help me wake up :D So I am writing this here for accountability<br>Day1:\u2705<br>Day2:\u2705<br>Day3:\u2705<br>Day4:\u2705<br>Day5:\u2705 Today I woke up and I was pleasently surprised to see my abs quite more defined in the morning :o Not only that, but I wasn\u2019t able to do a single hip lift on the 1st day. I was able to do 5 today!! (not all of 5 being super perfect but it\u2019s still progress) After working out I had some healhty pancakes for breakfast!
