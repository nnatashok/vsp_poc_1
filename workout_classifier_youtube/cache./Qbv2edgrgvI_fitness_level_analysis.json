  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves basic weight training movements that are clearly described as suitable for beginners and seniors, indicating a simple level of complexity. The exercises include upper body, lower body, and combination movements performed for 30 seconds each, with rest periods between sets. The workout's design, using standard weight-training exercises without any complex motions like twisting or advanced engagements, suggests a Beginner level. The score for Intermediate is lower but present due to the inclusion of combination movements that may require more coordination, and the channel's history of targeting a wide range of fitness levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated between Light and Moderate. This is a 20-minute workout with 30-second intervals focused on strength training. The mentioning of 'osteoporosis friendly' and 'no twisting or rounding of the spine' focuses on safety and lower intensity. Short rest intervals suggest some element of moderate effort. User comments praise the controlled pace, further indicating that the workout doesn't push high physical demand on deconditioned individuals. The advice to adjust weight use highlights adaptability for intensity but primarily suggests a lighter, more beginner-friendly workout.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level for this workout is primarily Beginner, strongly supported by the video's content explicitly targeting beginners and seniors. However, it also fits Intermediate due to the adaptable nature of the workouts (adjust weight, modify speed), allowing those with minimal training to scale intensity appropriately. Advanced scores are present since users can self-select weight, potentially intensifying the effort difficulty. Overall, the workout is designed to be inclusive, offering modifications to increase or decrease intensity, as evidenced by the channel's focus on adaptability and user-paced exertion."
