  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a 20-minute cardio workout specifically designed for pregnant individuals, primarily in the second trimester but suitable for all trimesters. The workout description clearly states that it features pregnancy-safe moves performed from a standing position, which suggests that it does not require any specific equipment. Additionally, there is no mention of any equipment in the title, tags, description, or comments, reinforcing the notion that it is a bodyweight-only workout. The absence of references to mats, resistance bands, or any other equipment in the metadata further supports the conclusion that no additional equipment is needed for this workout. Thus, the workout appears to be designed to be accessible without any equipment, focusing on cardio and low-impact exercises for prenatal fitness."
