  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is a Pilates workout aimed at beginners, which inherently suggests a moderate pace and a focus on smooth, controlled movements typical of the Flow & Rhythm spirit. This is supported by the title and description, which emphasize Pilates, a modality known for its flowing movements that connect the mind and body, and the tags reinforcing this concept. Furthermore, one top comment highlights the workout's slow pacing, ideal for maintaining coordination and mind-body connection, justifying the high score of 0.75 for Flow & Rhythm.\n\nThe Soothing & Restorative spirit is also relevant due to the beginner-friendly approach that is designed to create a gentle and accessible workout experience, as suggested by both the title and comments. The comments particularly highlight how the workout lifts moods and is not overly challenging, aligning with restorative qualities. This gentle and calming aspect, without high intensity, scores a 0.7, reflecting a significant but not predominant element.\n\nNo strong indicators suggest a Structured & Disciplined spirit, as the focus here is more on accessibility and ease rather than technical precision or incremental progressions."
