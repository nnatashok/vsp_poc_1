  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative,' indicated by phrases such as 'gentle lower back stretches,' 'reduce back stiffness,' and 'improve spinal flexibility' in the description. This session emphasizes relaxation and recovery, supported by user comments stating feelings of increased calmness and relaxation after completing the exercises. The inclusion of deep breathing exercises further reinforces this classification, warranting a high confidence score of 0.9.\n\nThe secondary spirit of 'Structured & Disciplined' is evident in the methodical approach of the routine. The description outlines a sequence of specific exercises progressing logically from warm-ups like 'lumbar rotations' and 'pelvic tilts' to a series of structured stretches. The use of specific time guidelines for maintaining stretches (10-30 seconds) and reference to ACSM standards for exercise protocols demonstrates a disciplined methodology, earning it a score of 0.7.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'High-Energy & Intense' are less relevant due to the session's focus on gentle movement rather than fast-paced or music-driven activities."
