  "vibesExplanation": "The video is best classified under 'The Warrior Workout' vibe (0.75) due to its heart-pounding full-body intensity. The workout's structure with segments such as 'High Intensity' and 'Abs Burn' aligned with phrases like 'sweat sesh', 'HIIT', and 'no equipment' implies a demanding, high-energy routine. These characteristics resonate strongly with the primal energy often attributed to 'The Warrior Workout'. Additionally, the comments highlight the workout's demanding nature, seeing it as 'one hell of a workout' and 'absolutely destroyed me', indicative of this vibe.\n\nThe 'Endorphin Wave' vibe (0.5) also fits due to the steady build-up through progressive sections targeting different muscle groups and the high-intensity finish. Comments like 'seeing results already' suggest a feel-good, ongoing fitness journey that boosts mood and energy levels.\n\n'Adrenaline Rush' (0.3) is marginally applicable due to the explosive high-intensity finish of the routine, suggesting unpredictable challenges typical of adrenaline-driven workouts. However, without elements like obstacle courses or extreme drills, its match is less pronounced.\n\nOverall, the metadata provides clear indicators of a high-intensity, sweat-inducing workout experience, suitable for 'The Warrior Workout', supported by descriptors and user feedback."
