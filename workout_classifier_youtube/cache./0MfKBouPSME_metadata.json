    "I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you. I\u2019ve been following your workouts for about a year now and you\u2019re my favorite trainer. I especially appreciate your focus on strength instead of weight loss. It would have been easy to slip into traditional weight loss talk after coming back from having a baby, but you continue to hold true to the mission of building strength. You are deeply appreciated for your authenticity, tenacity, and talents. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f",
