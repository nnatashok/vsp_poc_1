    "I like how peaceful your videos are but yet you calmly explain everything, not just silence. There\u2019s no pressure of yelling \u201ckeep going! One more!\u201d No monthly calendars that stress you out and make you feel inadequate because you didn\u2019t complete enough videos per day. Just the joy of fitness and going at your own pace. I used to be super into Blogilates but now I\u2019m converting to your videos. I can workout without feeling stressed and pressured.",
