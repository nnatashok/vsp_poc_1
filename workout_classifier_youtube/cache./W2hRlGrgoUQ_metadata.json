    "I work early mornings unloading groceries and this is the perfect way to start my day and get myself up &amp; out of bed at 4 am. :) i\u2019ve used this every morning for about a week or so. thank you so much for a routine that can be done in bed &amp; centers the back!",
    "My body is so ridiculously tight!  I decided to take a small step in the right direction by doing a short stretch routine morning and night.  Sticking to it..well, that will be another thing.  So this morning I took you out into my bathwater temp backyard, laid out a blanket, and followed along with you while watching white puffy clouds in the beautiful blue sky, listening to hummingbirds humming away in the flowers, Finches chirping away in the trees, and getting an occasional kiss from one of my pups.  Not only did you give me a stretch routine I CAN DO, but you made me want to do MORE!  Taking time to do your routine outside also made the beginning of my morning so peaceful and beautiful. Thank you Bird for understanding that not all of us are limber and for doing stretches a true beginner can do and feel good about!  Namaste.  \ud83d\ude0c"
