  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises listed in the video such as cat and cow, cobra pose, and downward facing dog are common in beginner yoga routines and involve straightforward movements with moderate coordination for some poses like downward facing dog. The inclusion of poses like locust and floating table may require a bit more strength and body awareness, warranting a partial score for intermediate difficulty. Additionally, the description emphasizes improving posture and core strength, which often involves some technical aspects of alignment, contributing slightly to the intermediate score.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is only 5 minutes long, focusing on posture improvement through yoga poses. The nature of these poses emphasizes low intensity and gentle movements, largely focusing on stretching and alignment rather than on high energy expenditure. The description references 'improving posture' without suggesting high-intensity or strenuous exercise, aligning primarily with light effort. The moderate score remains low as the routine may require some physical engagement like holding poses, which can be a bit challenging for very deconditioned individuals.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the low technique and effort difficulty, this routine is well-suited for beginners, aligning with Light Effort Difficulty and primarily Beginner Technique Difficulty. The intermediate score reflects the slight increase in complexity from poses like locust and some stretching of core muscles, which may require minimal prior experience or fitness awareness. As per guidelines, workouts often allow for modifications aligned with user levels, especially in yoga, justifying scores for more than one fitness level."
