  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout being analyzed is a Yoga Nidra session, which is a form of guided meditation that focuses on relaxation rather than physical exercise. In the video metadata, there are no mentions or implications of the use of any physical workout equipment. The description emphasizes lying down and relaxing, with terms such as 'lie down', 'relax', and 'guided meditation', which suggest a non-physical practice. Tags such as 'deep rest', 'yogic sleep', and 'meditation' further emphasize the nature of the practice as mental and emotional relaxation. Typically, Yoga Nidra involves lying down on the floor or any comfortable surface, making even a yoga mat unnecessary. Therefore, no equipment is required for this practice, and it appears to be bodyweight only."
