  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 1.0,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is classified as Beginner with a score of 1.0, as guided meditation involves very simple movements associated mainly with breathing and potentially maintaining a comfortable seating position. These actions require minimal physical coordination. The video description explicitly mentions this meditation as being appropriate for beginners and all levels, further supporting a beginner rating. However, because meditation can require some mental focus, a small score (0.4) is also given for Intermediate to reflect the focus and awareness involved, suitable for those with some experience in meditation, though not in a physical exercise context.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 1.0,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Effort Difficulty is rated as Light with a score of 1.0. The activity involves meditation rather than a physical exercise, implying very low energy expenditure. The meditation is meant for relaxation, peace, and positive energy accumulation, none of which involve physical exertion. The guided nature of the session allows participants to engage passively, with no physical intensity described. Additionally, the typical context of far-from-physical-demand is reinforced by the description, tags, and comments.",

    }
  ],
  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 1.0,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the beginner level in technique and light effort difficulty, the required fitness level is predominantly Beginner with a score of 1.0. This aligns with the explicit mention of the meditation being suitable for beginners in the description and tags. Since meditation does not require physical fitness, users across all physical conditions, including those in poor shape, can participate easily. However, a small nod to Intermediate (0.2) is also considered suitable for individuals who might want to enhance their meditation practice, thereby increasing mental endurance and focus."
