  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Meditation', with very high confidence (0.95). The title explicitly mentions 'Guided Meditation', and the description supports this focus by detailing a 20-minute session aimed at promoting 'positive energy, relaxation, and peace'. The tags further reinforce this category with repeated mentions of 'guided meditation', 'positive energy', and 'meditation for beginners', aligning with the channel's emphasis on personal growth and mindfulness. \n\nA secondary category considered is 'Breathing exercises' with a lower score of 0.35. Although the video potentially includes breathing components as part of the guided meditation, the explicit focus is more on mental states like visualization and affirmations rather than structured breathing techniques. Hence, 'Breathing exercises' is only mildly represented. Other categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' are excluded as the focus is not on physical postures but rather on mental relaxation and positive energy."
