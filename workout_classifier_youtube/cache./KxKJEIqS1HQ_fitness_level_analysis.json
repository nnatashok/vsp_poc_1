  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves basic running intervals, which are straightforward and suitable for beginners, as indicated by the tags 'beginner running' and the description with easy-to-follow pacing instructions. Coordination required is minimal, aligning with beginner-level technique. However, the 'pyramid style' of intervals suggests slightly more complex pacing changes, adding a moderate alignment with intermediate technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 23 minutes long, consisting of various intervals with increasing and decreasing intensity, aligning with a moderate effort level, suitable for beginners shifting to slightly more demanding activities. The effort levels (6/10 to 9/10 perceived effort) with built-in rests support this classification as moderate. However, the varied intensity and shorter rest options at higher speeds (9/10) could be considered challenging, indicating moderate-to-high effort difficulty for newer users.",
