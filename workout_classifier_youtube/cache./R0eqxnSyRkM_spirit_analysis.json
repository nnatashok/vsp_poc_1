  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is predominantly classified under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with high confidence due to the emphasis on stretching and recovery ('Full Body RECOVERY', 'dynamic stretching and strengthening', 'perfect for recovery days'). Comments by viewers mentioning the video's suitability for recovery and mental health support further affirm this classification. The spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' is also applicable, with moderate confidence, as the workout involves continuous movement patterns ('dynamic stretching', 'easy to follow motions') and has a structured work/rest cycle ('50 Sec Work, 10 Sec Rest') that contributes to a rhythmic quality. The absence of high-intensity descriptors and the focus on recovery clearly exclude 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility'. The workout being home-based with no indication of outdoor elements rules out 'Outdoor & Adventure'. While there's a level of structure ('no repeat', '50 Sec Work, 10 Sec Rest'), it is not rigorous enough to categorize it as 'Structured & Disciplined'. This nuanced analysis confirms the primary soothing and rhythmic nature of the workout."
