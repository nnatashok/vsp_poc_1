  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled '25 MIN FEEL GOOD PILATES || At-Home Pilates Workout (No Equipment)', which typically suggests a focus on mat-based movements as no other equipment is mentioned. The tag 'mat pilates' further suggests that a mat would be used to perform these exercises. Additionally, the description explicitly references a 'Mat from Liforme,' providing a promotional link, indicating that although no other equipment is required, a mat is likely intended to enhance comfort and safety during floor exercises. Hence, a mat is needed with very high confidence, rated at 0.9, as it is central to Pilates routines and explicitly mentioned in the metadata."
