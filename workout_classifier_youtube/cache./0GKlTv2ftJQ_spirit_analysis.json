  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' primarily due to its description and structure as a treadmill interval workout. The term 'HIIT' (High-Intensity Interval Training) in the tags and comments, along with phrases like 'to push myself to put the hard work' and 'sweat & burn off calories' indicate a focus on effort and intensity, which supports a high-energy classification. A score of 0.65 reflects the intensity of the intervals despite the beginner level, as more resistance levels can increase the workout's intensity.\n\nThe workout also embodies 'Structured & Disciplined' qualities, given the precise layout of interval sets and recovery phases detailed in the description. The breaking down of sessions with time-specific intervals (30-second intense, followed by 15-second recovery) and progression through increasing resistance levels indicate methodical structuring, justifying a 0.6 score.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' and other spirits were not chosen due to lack of evidence for continuous movement or mind-body connection. Additionally, the indoor treadmill setting excludes 'Outdoor & Adventure.' The comprehensive planning evident in the workout aligns more with structured discipline rather than just high energy alone, hence its inclusion."
