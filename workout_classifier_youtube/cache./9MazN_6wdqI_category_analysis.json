  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as 'Yoga' due to explicit references in the title ('Yoga To Reduce Stress'), description, tags, and the complete focus on yoga postures like child's pose, cobra, downward dog, and savasana. The channel name, 'Jess Yoga,' and the instructor's credentials as a certified yoga instructor further support this classification. The score is set at 1.0, demonstrating extremely strong presence as the defining characteristic of the video.\n\n'Yoga' is complemented by 'Stretching' with a score of 0.7. The description mentions 'relaxing stretches' and incorporates a variety of poses focusing on body stretching and flexibility, such as the seated wide-legged forward fold and neck stretches, which are integral parts of the session.\n\nThe channel\u2019s focus and user comments, emphasizing the calm and relaxing nature of the practice, aligned with breathing awareness, also suggest a secondary stretching component, hence the moderate score for 'Stretching.' There is no indication for other potential categories like Pilates or Mat, as the session is yoga-centric, with stretching as a support."
