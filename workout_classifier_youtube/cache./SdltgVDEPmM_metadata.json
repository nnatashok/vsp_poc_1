    "Sliiiiiiding into the weekend with this splits stretch!! I know a lot of you guys have been requesting this one so I hope you enjoy!! Remember...flexibility takes a lot of time, patience, and consistency! Splits won&#39;t come overnight. But if you practice daily, you&#39;ll see progress in no time! \u2764\ufe0f",
    "When I was 17 I was so close to doing a split (I was also a Latin dancer). Now I&#39;m 24 and in terrible shape. I don&#39;t even have the energy to work out for 10 minutes because my stress is fighting my body. So I decided to start stretching again. I&#39;m on day 2 currently. Wish me luck \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb",
    "Oh my goodness, I am a 47 yrs old women, and i just started wit Madfit last year, this is the 1st time i was able to almost touch the floor. Thank  you so much. I am accomplishing a split.",
    "FINALLY DOING THE SPLITS! Bum touched the floor for the first time today. Been incorporating this stretch into my routine for the last 3 months. I&#39;d been using a different stretch routine for the last year, but this one nudged me to the finish line. Thank you so much!",
    "i finally can do my splits guyyysss!!! it took me about 4 and a half month, and I stretched nearly every day (but bodies are different, some can do the split in 2 weeks some need to stretch for some month)"
