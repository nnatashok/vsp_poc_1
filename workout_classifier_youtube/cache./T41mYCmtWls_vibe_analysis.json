  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'The Zen Flow' with a score of 0.8 due to its grounding and breath-centered nature, which is evident from phrases like 'energy boosting morning yoga flow' and its focus on being suitable for beginners without any props needed. The description emphasizes a full body stretch and slight strengthening, suggesting a slow, intentional movement with a focus on breath, common in Zen Flow vibes. 'The Reboot Workout' is also a relevant vibe with a score of 0.7 because the video is described as targeting 'all the aches and pains you may have accumulated during the night,' which aligns with a refreshing and low-stress total-body refresh. Lastly, 'The Comfort Moves' scores a 0.4 as the practice is designed for beginners, described as 'gentle' and 'energetic boosting,' making it accessible and comforting for those easing into a morning routine. Other potentially relevant vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' were excluded due to the lack of repetitive endurance activity emphasized in the metadata."
