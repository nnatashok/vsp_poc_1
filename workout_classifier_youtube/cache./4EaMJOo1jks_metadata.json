  "title": "LET GO of Anxiety, Fear & Worries: A GUIDED MEDITATION \u27a4 Harmony, Inner Peace & Emotional Healing",
  "description": "A guided meditation: LET GO of anxiety, fear, and worries, and open up to Harmony, Inner Peace, and Healing. Does worrying drain your energy and take away your ability to be present and truly enjoy life? Do you want to stop the fear, stress, or anxiety that can build up from negative thinking? Imagine letting go of 50% of your worries and fears? How good would you feel? Imagine letting go of 80% of them? What would you appreciate the most about that kind of freedom? Allow yourself to LET GO in a safe and natural way - Heal and Transform energy that does not serve you anymore. Like a tree in autumn lets go of the leaves naturally, effortlessly, and inevitably...\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Full album with 5 tracks available on iTunes \u25ba https://apple.co/2TIci0K\n\nThis guided meditation is created with Unconditional Love because I care about you. I really do. I don\u00b4t need to know you to care. You deserve all the good in life. \n\nMusic is tuned to 432Hz and contains 4hzTheta binaural beats. Listen with headphones if you want the benefit of the binaural beats. Go old school; no Bluetooth. Wires only. Keep your brain unfried, raw, and healthy. \n\nPOWER TIP: Listen daily for 28 days in a row for the best results. Repetition reinforces the healing. Experience says new neurological signals \"stick\" after 28 days of continuous reinforcement. \n\nIt is time to Love fully, Live Fully, and Shine Your Beautiful Light.\n\nMuch Love,\nKenneth :)\n\n\nCONNECT WITH ME HERE:\nINSTAGRAM \u25ba https://www.instagram.com/kennethsoares.livingfully\nINSIGHT TIMER (MEDITATIONS OFFLINE) \u25bahttp://insig.ht/KennethSoares\n\n\n................................\n\nHOW TO DO GUIDED MEDITATION:\nhttp://www.powerthoughtsmeditationclub.com/how-to-do-guided-meditations/\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\nDOWNLOAD OUR SINGLES & ALBUMS HERE:\n\nITUNES \u25bahttp://apple.co/2lp23Rr\n\nAMAZON \u25ba http://amzn.to/2kx0RcZ\n\nMP3 AUDIO SHOP \u25ba https://powerthoughtsmeditationclub.dpdcart.com\n\nNEED MUSIC FOR YOUR PROJECTS? \nRoyalty-Free & Commercial Use Music Licenses \n\u25ba https://www.highermind-royaltyfreemusic.com/?ref=23/?ref=23\n\nBOUNDARY SETTING COURSE AVAILABLE NOW: \n\u2726 Set Conscious Boundaries: Stand Up For Yourself & Let Go Of People Pleasing For Good \u2726\n20 lessons filled with theoretical and practical knowledge that will take your boundary-setting skills to the next level: https://kennethsoares.earth/courses/set-healthy-boundaries-let-go-of-people-pleasing/?ref=21\n\n...................\n\nWe are forever grateful to everyone who supports us just by tuning in to our channel, and for all of you who buy our meditations, solfeggios, and music!

    "Dear brothers and sisters, I am reading through the comments here and it feels like bathing in waves of Love and Joy!

You truly inspire me to give more, be more and continue to create these meditations for you and others \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc <br>In Loving Kindness, <br>Kenneth Soares",
    "All i needed was a hug someone to tell me its gonna be ok. Who knew that hugging myself would bring me to tears. Its hard to let go.",
    "My anxiety sometimes is so bad that I feel sick a whole week. I feel like I lost control of my self. This meditation helps me go on another day",
    "Am I the only one who cried when he started talking about the future you hugging you and thanking you. It really triggered an emotional response. So often we neglect ourselves when really we should take care of ourselves and love ourselves because we are deserving. I love everyone who reads this. We will get through this. We are strong, safe and all the good things in life. Take care of yourselves especially through this uncertain time period \u2764\ufe0f",
    "If you are reading this, which is pretty rare, I want to let You know you have been through the worse and made it up until now that should be enough evidence to show how truly Powerful you are. \u2764"
