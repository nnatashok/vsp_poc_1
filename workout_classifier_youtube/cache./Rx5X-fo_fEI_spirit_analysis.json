  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit identified for this meditation video is 'Soothing & Restorative,' with a very high confidence score of 0.95. This is evident from the video's title, 'Guided Mindfulness Meditation - Go Easy on Yourself - Self-care and Self-Love,' and the description emphasizing themes of relaxation, self-care, and managing stress and anxiety. The purpose of the video is clearly to promote a gentle, restorative experience, as highlighted by the words 'mindfulness,' 'calm,' 'peaceful,' and 'self-love.' The channel's description and the comments also reinforce this spirit by focusing on mental health, relaxation, and stress relief.\n\nA secondary spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm' is identified with a lower confidence score of 0.2. This is due to the video\u2019s use of guided dialogue and ambient music, which suggests a continuous, flowing experience, though it's not the primary focus. The absence of any vigorous activity or athletic elements excludes other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Sport & Agility,' or 'Outdoor & Adventure.'"
