    "So happy to have found your channel. What an answer to prayer. I don\u2019t believe in signs but it was really comforting to read that inspiring quote in back of your videos! I will definitely share your channel with others and I\u2019m interested in your postpartum fitness challenge. Peace &amp; Love \ud83d\udc95",
    "I\u2019m not pregnant anymore, but I LOVED working out with you until I was about 39 weeks along, so I will do this workout anyway! Congrats on baby number 4! Looking forward to seeing more new content for my next pregnancy! Best prenatal instructor!",
    "My 7 year old did this work out with me and when you said &quot;it&#39;s just cardio.&quot; She said &quot;No, it&#39;s torture!&quot; \ud83d\ude06 we got a great workout from this video. Thank you for all you do!!",
    "I am not pregnant, but I did your prenatal and postpartum plans and loved them both. I felt so strong, fit, confident, and just GOOD during my pregnancy, and also similar after the postpartum plan. I love the added timer on the right, and the background music. Keep sharing your talents, Ashley!! I appreciate you!!",
    "This will be my second pregnancy using your prenatal workout program! My first pregnancy and labor went without any complications, and I felt fantastic the entire pregnancy. This one I have been feeling more sluggish, so I&#39;m starting your program back up again around ( 22 weeks ) pregnant. Love it!! Moms really need this program. \ud83d\udc95"
