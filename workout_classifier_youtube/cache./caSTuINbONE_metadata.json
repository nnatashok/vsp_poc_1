    "Update a year in - My body is much toner than it was a year ago. I do the exercise around 4-5 times per week. It&#39;s light, only takes 30 minutes. My core and upper body core improve noticeably. It&#39;s perfect to keep you going on a healthier track. The hardest thing is to start doing it. But believe me, just do it and it will be done in no time. Thank you Lidia for this exercise &lt;3 I&#39;m forever grateful",
    "i did this whole workout, i had to stop for a couple seconds on some bc it\u2019s sooo intense but i\u2019m really proud of myself and i will definitely be doing this more :))",
    "i did the whole workout and im so proud of myself. even though my stomach burns af right now and my legs and arms are slightly shaking, this was so amazing to do. thank you for this &lt;3",
    "i have been doing this for the past 8 months and i have seen amazing results now i will have the perfect body for the first day of school\u2764\u2764\u2764\u200d\ud83d\udd25",
    "This work out is beginner friendly but it is also intense. Towards the end it got harder for me but I made it through. This is an great workout and will be doing it frequently until I can get through the video with no stops."
