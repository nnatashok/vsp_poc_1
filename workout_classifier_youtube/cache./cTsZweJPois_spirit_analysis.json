  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified into three spirits: 'Flow & Rhythm', 'Soothing & Restorative', and 'Structured & Disciplined.' The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is strongly indicated by the nature of Pilates itself, which emphasizes smooth and continuous movements and mind-body connection, evident from the terms 'full body Pilates' and 'mat Pilates' in the title and tags. The score of 0.75 is based on the implicit rhythmic flow typically associated with Pilates, though not overtly mentioned in the metadata.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' score of 0.75 is justified through the practiced emphasis on coordinated and systematic movements common in pilates. The 'Soothing & Restorative' aspect received a score of 0.65, suggested by comments highlighting relaxation, the beginner-friendly nature, and the calming impact ('I feel so relaxed!', 'beginner friendly'). This spirit is supported by the commenter's reaction to the workout's calming nature but was not heavily emphasized in the video metadata.\n\nFinally, 'Structured & Disciplined' has a score of 0.6 due to the methodical approach associated with Pilates, evident in the description which mentions 'return to the basics' and 'intention and posture' as features of the workout. This indicates a focus on structured exercises and discipline in movement, albeit at a beginner level. Therefore, it doesn't dominate but is a clear component of the session."
