  "vibesExplanation": "This video strongly embodies 'The Zen Flow' vibe due to its focus on breath-centered, intention-driven practice. The description emphasizes relaxation and the benefits of a calm, intentional approach, while highlighting breathwork's grounding effects. The tags 'morning yoga,' 'meditation,' and 'guided breathing exercises' further support this vibe, leading to a high confidence score. \n\nAdditionally, 'The Deep Recharge' vibe also fits well, as the session is designed to reset the nervous system and provide energy and focus, aspects often associated with deep recharging practices. The description mentions benefits like boosting the immune system and lowering stress, aligning with restorative qualities, but to a slightly lesser extent than just the zen focus, hence a moderate score. \n\nOther potential vibes, such as 'The Meditative Grind,' were excluded due to the short duration and focus on relaxation and rhythm rather than long, repetitive endurance which is typical for 'The Meditative Grind.' The presence of rhythmic music infuses a tranquil yet energizing quality that enhances both of these selected vibes."
