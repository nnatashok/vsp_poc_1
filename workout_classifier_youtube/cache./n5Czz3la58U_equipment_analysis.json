  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title, description, and tags explicitly mention this is a 'Wall Pilates Beginner Workout' that uses the wall itself as a key element for performing the exercises. The description specifically states 'Pilates Workout NO Equipment,' indicating that no additional equipment is necessary. The channel focuses on Pilates workouts, and this particular series adapts traditional mat and reformer exercises to be performed against a wall. The mention of potentially using ankle weights is suggested as a way to increase intensity, but it is not required for the basic execution of the workout. Therefore, the classification for this video is bodyweight only, utilizing a wall as the primary support and resistance tool, which does not count as a separate equipment type under the given options."
