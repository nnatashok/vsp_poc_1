  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Mat' with a high score of 0.9, as the workout is a home cardio routine involving typical floor exercises and no mention of equipment, aligning with the description and comments about activities like 'jumping jacks,' 'plank jacks,' and 'mountain climber' exercises, which are typically performed on an exercise mat. The secondary category is 'Body weight' with a score of 0.7, as the channel and video description emphasize workouts that use body weight for resistance, evidenced by comments describing exercises that do not require external equipment. The focus on abdominal exercises and body movement supports these classifications, and other potential categories like 'HIIT' or 'Weight workout' were excluded due to the lack of explicit mention of high-intensity intervals or use of weights, respectively."
