  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is clearly focused on an indoor cycling workout, as evidenced by the title \"45 Minute Indoor Cycling Ramp Workout\" and repeated mentions of \"cycling,\" \"spin class,\" \"spinning,\" and \"indoor cycling\" in the tags. The description discusses ramp workouts and various cycling efforts (e.g., sprints, moderate to max intensity), which are exercises typically performed on an exercise bike. Additionally, the comments reflect users' experiences with \"indoor cycling sessions,\" further supporting the need for an exercise bike. All these indicators combine to give very high confidence (0.9) that an exercise bike is required for this workout."
