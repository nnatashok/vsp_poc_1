  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is primarily Beginner with some Intermediate elements. The video is labeled as a 'Morning Yoga Flow' which implies a series of yoga movements strung together, likely involving basic stances and transitions typically seen in beginner to intermediate yoga. User comments indicate that complete beginners can attempt it, although one did mention a realization of being out of shape, hinting at some complexity. There is a potential mix of actions that could require some coordination and flexibility characteristic of the lower Intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified mainly as Light effort due to its duration of 15 minutes and the nature of a yoga flow designed to energize and balance, rather than exert. It focuses more on waking up and feeling good rather than rigorous physical demands. However, yoga can sometimes challenge those who are significantly deconditioned, hence a slight consideration for Moderate effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.75,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is mostly suited for Beginners, as suggested by the accessibility and low energy demand of the yoga flow. The description and tags focus on waking up and feeling energized, indicating a gentle form suitable for beginners. It might slightly benefit those at an Intermediate level looking for a quick and easy routine as part of their regular practice, hence the lower Intermediate score."
