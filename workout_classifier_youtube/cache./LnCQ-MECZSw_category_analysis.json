  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified under 'Stretching' as the primary category due to several strong indicators in the metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'Stretch,' and the description emphasizes a 'full body stretch for beginners,' further confirming this focus. Additionally, the tags include 'stretching exercises,' 'full body stretch yoga,' and 'yoga stretch,' all of which reinforce the centrality of stretching in this workout. \n\nThe comments also support this classification, with viewers appreciating the simplicity and effectiveness of the stretch exercises. The video length, set at 10 minutes, aligns with the typical duration for a quick, focused stretching routine. While tags mention 'yoga,' the primary emphasis is on stretching rather than traditional yoga practice, hence it wasn't chosen as a primary or secondary category.\n\nThe confidence level is very high (0.95) since nearly all metadata points strongly towards stretching as the core component of the workout."
