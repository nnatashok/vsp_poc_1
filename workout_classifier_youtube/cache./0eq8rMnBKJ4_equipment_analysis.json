  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled \"Intense Interval Blast | 15 Minute Indoor Cycling Workout,\" explicitly indicating that it is a cycling workout focused on indoor training, which strongly implies the use of an exercise bike. The channel, GCN Training, specializes in cycling workouts, which further solidifies the likelihood that an exercise bike is necessary. Additionally, the tags such as \"indoor cycling,\" \"spin workout,\" \"gym bike,\" and \"spinning\" reinforce that the workout is indeed a cycling exercise, necessitating an exercise bike. The detailed description of interval training with sprints provides a structured format typically executed on a stationary bike, thus a confidence score of 0.9 is assigned."
