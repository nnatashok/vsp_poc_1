  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily 'Structured & Disciplined' due to the structured nature of strength-training circuits mentioned in the description. The workout follows a methodical approach with exercises like tempo squats and single-leg deadlifts that indicate progressive training and technical precision. This spirit is scored a 1.0 because of the explicit mention of circuit-based strength training and the involvement of a 'Nike Global Master Trainer,' suggesting rigorous and precise planning.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is also applicable but to a lesser extent (scored 0.75). The description hints at intensity with phrases like 'get ready for a challenge' and the comment 'props for the energy' suggests the workout requires significant effort, aligning with this spirit. However, the workout seems more focused on strength and structured routines rather than pure intensity.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded due to the lack of emphasis on smooth movements or relaxation, respectively. Similarly, 'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are not relevant based on the description and nature of the workout."
