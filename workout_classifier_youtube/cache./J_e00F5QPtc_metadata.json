    "I love it when it doesn&#39;t go over 30 min. Mornings are really busy and when workouts are over 30 miin I  have to rush over rest between sets to get it done faster. Keep it up! Amazing workout! Thank you so much!",
    "Who am I??  Up at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_e00F5QPtc&amp;t=330\">5:30</a> to make sure I get my workout in.  I do feel amazing!  Thanks, Cee!",
    "Four months ago, on my 65th birthday, I gave myself the gift of self care and started \u201clifting with Cee\u201d. I lift every other day and feel so much stronger. Also, I\u2019m 10 pounds down which is amazing. Thank you so much for helping me recalibrate my life!",
    "Of all the daily week formats, I think this one is the best.<br><br>1. Music is instrumentally positive (no words). Nice volume.<br>2. Workout is in 3 quick sets.<br>3. No mic.<br><br>This one pushes you hard - but feels good!<br><br>Thanks for doing what you do Cee. You are single-handedly getting people (like me) more fit &amp; fabulous at 40+!",
    "I was diagnosed with breast cancer last April, and went through 16 cycles of chemo, two surgeries, and radiation treatments.  A year ago, I was a fit 56-year old, and at my ideal weight.  Now I find myself 45 pounds heavier, and very out of shape!  I have been frustrated by the weight gain, and the fatigue which has kept me from doing the exercise I used to enjoy.  I have been looking for a way to gently begin an active lifestyle again, and I am encouraged and inspired by your videos! I too love to weight lift, so your format and style are a great fit for me.  I just finished my first 30-minute workout, and am thrilled that I made it through!  Please continue to make videos \u2014 I don\u2019t care how long they are \u2014 I plan on continuing to follow you!"
