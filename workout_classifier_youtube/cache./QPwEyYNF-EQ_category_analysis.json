  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Calisthenics', as indicated by both the title ('30 Min BODYWEIGHT CALISTHENICS WORKOUT') and multiple tags such as 'calisthenics', 'calisthenics workout', and 'build muscle with calisthenics'. These elements suggest a focus on calisthenics exercises that typically involve bodyweight movements, justifying a high score of 0.9. The video description mentions 'dynamic mobility and static stretches', which aligns with the 'Stretching' category, assigned a moderate score of 0.5, reflecting its complementary role in the workout. Additionally, 'Body weight' is chosen because the workout utilizes bodyweight exercises, as supported by tags like 'bodyweight calisthenics' and mentions in the description, resulting in a score of 0.6. While the video includes elements of stretching, it primarily focuses on calisthenics. Consequently, other potential categories like 'Mat', 'HIIT', or 'Weight workout' were excluded due to the lack of relevant indicators."
