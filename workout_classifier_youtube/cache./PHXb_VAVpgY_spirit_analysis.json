  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit identified is 'Outdoor & Adventure' with a score of 0.7. This is due to the emphasis on 'virtual run down Portobello Road, near Dunedin, New Zealand' and 'virtual running videos' that transport users to outdoor settings despite being indoors. The scenic component is highlighted in both the title and tags, supporting this classification. 'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant, scoring 0.6, as the video includes music to set a pace, which suggests a continuous movement motif typical of this spirit. The music-driven pacing is collaboratively referenced in the title and comments. 'Soothing & Restorative' receives a lower score of 0.4, as the description mentions no metrics and the addition of music, possibly indicating an intention for a more relaxing experience, although this is less pronounced. Other spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined,' were not applicable as the workout lacks an emphasis on intensity or technical structure."
