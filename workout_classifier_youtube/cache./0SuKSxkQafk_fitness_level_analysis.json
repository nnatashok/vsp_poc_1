  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "While positioned as suitable for beginners, the 60-minute duration suggests that deconditioned users may find it challenging. Hence, the workout is more fittingly aligned with intermediate fitness levels, who have some experience with longer duration cardio. Advanced runners would find this beneficial at maintaining baseline endurance, justified by the metadata's mention of suitability for marathon training, indicating an aspect of long-distance fitness preparation."
