    "I am STILL doing this year after year - it&#39;s still the best synergy of inspiration, music and choreography. I&#39;ve done 100&#39;s of spin classes in person over the years and enjoyed being pushed by some seriously inspiring leaders - but nothing online has been as good as this one class. It even got me fit again after battling stage 4 cancer and massive back surgery. A totally inspiring session with a fun group and a motivating leader. His evocation of actual road riding is especially appreciated - I can picture some of my favourite strava segments as I&#39;m doing some of these intervals. And if I&#39;m perfectly honest - I&#39;ve occasionally heard Paul&#39;s exhortations while I&#39;m out road riding! Thanks so much for this - it&#39;s an incredibly valuable and appreciated session!",
    "Hey GCN, you guys need more videos with Paul he\u2019s an excellent teacher",
    "One of the best spinning instructors I ever have the opportunity to see on the internet. I think Paul Ryman is a very knowledgeable instructor. Thanks, GCN for this video.",
    "Paul is the best gcn instructor. More of Paul please!!",
    "One of my fave GCN rides, keep going back to it and now found nearly all the tracks on Spotify"
