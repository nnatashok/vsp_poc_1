  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as evidenced by keywords in the title ('Intense Interval Blast'), description ('Get ready to sweat!'), and tags ('intense', 'hiit', 'interval', 'cardio workout'). These elements indicate a fast-paced session designed to push physical limits through high-intensity interval training, as supported by the structured intervals listed in the description.\n\nAdditionally, 'Structured & Disciplined' is a significant component of the workout spirit, with the description outlining precise timing and intensity levels (e.g., '30-second sprints', '1 mins @ 4/10'). This suggests an organized approach to cycling with explicit timing and effort levels, typical of structured workouts.\n\nThe channel's focus on cycling workouts and its systematic method strengthen this classification. Although there is a mention of music, the primary emphasis is on intensity and structured training. Other spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the workout's focus on intensity and interval structure rather than seamless movement or relaxation."
