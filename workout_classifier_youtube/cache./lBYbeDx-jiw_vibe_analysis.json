  "vibesExplanation": "The video title, \"5 Minute Morning Yoga - Daily Stretching Routine,\" and description emphasize a quick, calming start to the day with stretching and energizing poses like a side bend and downward facing dog, which aligns well with 'The Zen Flow' vibe that focuses on grounding, intentional, and breath-centered practices. The mention of simple, low-stress poses in a short duration supports the classification.\n\nThe second suitable vibe is 'The Reboot Workout.' The description's focus on feeling better despite the short duration and the routine's intention to create a sense of renewal or refreshment after only five minutes aligns with this vibe's emphasis on a low-stress total-body refresh.\n\nTags such as 'yoga for beginners' and comments mentioning the effectiveness despite short duration further indicate a tranquil and refreshing workout rather than an intense or competitive one. Thus, vibes indicative of high intensity or competition like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor' are excluded. Overall, the data strongly supports 'The Zen Flow' as the primary vibe."
