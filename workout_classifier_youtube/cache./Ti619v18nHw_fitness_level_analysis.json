  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout primarily comprises static stretches with some flowing movements, common in basic yoga routines. These movements are simple, emphasizing relaxation and do not require high coordination. The mention of familiar yoga postures indicates a basic level of complexity, but since yoga poses can range in complexity, a mild alignment with 'Intermediate' is warranted, though the overall setup and description strongly favor 'Beginner' due to the simplicity and familiarity implied by the routine.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is explicitly labeled as a stretch routine for relaxation and muscle recovery, indicative of very low energy expenditure. The static nature of the exercises combined with the calming focus suggests a 'Light' effort level. Phrases like 'relaxation', 'muscle recovery', and 'rest day stretch' confirm this low physical demand, establishing a definitive classification of 'Light' for effort difficulty.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The 20-minute duration and inclusion of basic yoga elements align the workout with a 'Beginner' level primarily, given its focus on muscle recovery and relaxation. However, the routine being part of a workout challenge and mentioning 'familiar yoga postures' suggests some users with minimal experience might find it beneficial, warranting a moderate alignment with 'Intermediate'. The inclusion of 'Advanced' is marginal and mostly due to context (e.g., advanced users using it for recovery), but would likely only serve as relaxation rather than a fitness challenge for this group."
