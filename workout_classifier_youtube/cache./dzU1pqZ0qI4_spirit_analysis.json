  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.8. This is evidenced by the words 'Pilates', 'full body workout', and 'cardio flows' in the title and description, suggesting a focus on continuous, smooth movements combined with rhythmic, flowing patterns. The channel's background in Pilates and dancing further supports this classification. The score reflects high confidence due to the heavy emphasis on Pilates and flow-based exercise with moderate cardio elements.\n\nAdditionally, 'High-Energy & Intense' is assigned a score of 0.6. The description mentions 'athletic cardio' and 'increase your heart rate for a fun and sweaty session', indicating moderately intense cardio elements are incorporated into the workout. This is supported by comments noting the energizing nature and heart rate elevation during the session. The confidence level is lower but still high, as the primary focus remains Pilates and rhythm, not maximum intensity.\n\nOther spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were not included, as the workout does not emphasize technical precision or relaxation and recovery."
