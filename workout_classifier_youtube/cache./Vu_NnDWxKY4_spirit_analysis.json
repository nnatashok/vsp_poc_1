  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is primarily classified under the 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits. The title mentions 'Yoga for Weight Loss' and 'Fat Burning Workout,' which suggests a sequence of movements aimed at burning fat, but within the context of yoga, this implies a flowing, rhythmic practice. Tags like 'yoga for beginners' and 'yoga at home' reinforce the idea of a practice that is approachable and movement-based rather than intense. The comments further describe experiences of emotional well-being and a calmer state of mind after these sessions, suggesting a 'Soothing & Restorative' element to the workout. This aligns with the channel's focus on offering 'yoga, pilates, cardio, strength training,' indicating an emphasis on flow and holistic wellness. Overall, the video's spirit leans towards 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the structured sequences of yoga poses, with a notable 'Soothing & Restorative' aspect due to the calming effects reported by users."
