  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "No one will ever understand how much I love this woman\u2026 Nicole, you only see your camera and your button on the laptop, to upload your videos. But you don\u2019t see me, doing your workouts every morning in my small flat in the living room, before going to university. Sitting in the library, being able to concentrate better and longer, because I already moved my body in such a nice and gentle way. Being supported by a gentle voice and a great person, who works out with me. Nicole, you are doing such a great work, you can be extremely proud of yourself! You make other life\u2019s much better, even in other countries\ud83e\udd0d",
    "Hi Nicole! I am from Ukraine. I started to do workouts to distracted myself for half an hour from the war that is going in my country. Every day your classes help me to resist depression. As long as I move I feel alive. Thank you very much.",
    "Nicole is an absolute gem. I wish she knows how much she has changed my life. So much positive energy day in and day out, a better relationship with myself both mind and body\u2026 Nicole keeps producing all these videos so consistently for free that I must think she\u2019s the most generous person out there.",
    "Im always waiting for the \u201cwell deserved child pose\u201d",
    "Everyone let\u2019s get Nicole to 3 million followers. Share with friends and fam. She deserves it and everyone should experience her!"
