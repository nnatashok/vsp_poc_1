  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is clearly designed to be performed without any equipment. The title \"Do This Every Morning 20 min (low impact) full-body workout\" and the tags emphasize it as a 'low impact', 'beginner', and 'all standing workouts', suggesting it's suitable for a wide audience and no equipment is necessary. The description explicitly states, \"no equipment is needed,\" which directly confirms that the workout is bodyweight only. No other metadata, including comments or tags, suggests any deviation from this. Therefore, there is no equipment needed to perform this workout effectively, resulting in an empty list for required equipment."
