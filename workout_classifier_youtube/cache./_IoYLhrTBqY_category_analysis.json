  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is \"Stretching\" with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is clearly indicated by the video's title, \"DAILY STRETCH,\" and the description emphasizing flexibility and mobility training, mentioning the stretching of various body parts such as hamstrings and hip flexors. The tags also include 'stretch', further reinforcing this classification.\n\n\"Yoga\" is included with a lower score of 0.4. While the description and tags mention yoga, the main focus of the video seems to be on stretching as a standalone activity for increasing flexibility rather than a typical yoga session with poses and meditative elements.\n\n\"Mat\" is also relevant, given the workout is floor-based with no equipment, suggesting a routine performed on a mat, which aligns with mat workouts that involve exercises performed on an exercise mat. The score of 0.5 reflects this as a noticeable but supporting aspect of the workout.\n\nThus, stretching is the most defining characteristic, supported by mat-based exercise, with slight elements related to yoga practice."
