    "I&#39;m a beginner and I never knew there should be interval. Thanks for this.",
    "I can just feel the burn in my legs watching this workout! I am waiting for mine to get here.",
    "Most peeps don\u2019t like manual treadmills. They buy one and then gets rid of it. Including me. But that\u2019s a real nice looking good quality one there. The first manual I ever seen with a tension knob. Seems like manual treadmills are for athletes. Someone in great shape and advanced in muscle work.",
