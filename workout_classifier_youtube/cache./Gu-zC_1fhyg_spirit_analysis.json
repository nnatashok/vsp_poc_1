  "spiritsExplanation": "The video metadata provides strong evidence that the workout falls primarily into the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit category. The title, '15 min Full Body Stretch | Daily Routine for Flexibility & Relaxation,' explicitly emphasizes relaxation and stretching, which suggests a focus on gentle, restorative movements. The tags such as 'relaxing,' 'relax,' 'relaxation,' and 'cool down' reinforce this, along with mentions of flexibility and daily routines in both the tags and the description. User comments about flexibility improvements, relaxation, and implementing the routine into daily practice further support this classification. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant with a score of 0.6, as the description refers to a stretching routine that might involve smooth, continuous movement \u2014 typical of flexibility-enhancing practices akin to yoga. However, given the predominant focus on relaxation and gentle stretching, the 'Flow & Rhythm' element is secondary. There is no indication of intense or structured activity, excluding those spirits."
