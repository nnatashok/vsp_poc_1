  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' due to the title and description emphasizing 'easy exercises' that can be done 'in bed,' suggesting a gentle and accessible routine suitable for those who may find traditional workouts challenging. The mention of doing the exercises 'sitting on your back or on your knees or tummy' further supports a gentle approach. The top comments also highlight the workout as manageable even for those with physical constraints, like a user mentioning they have vertigo, indicating a restorative focus. This spirit is given a score of 0.7, as the workout promotes comfort over exertion.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is also identified due to the description's mention of a 'workout program' with '12 exercises,' implying a methodical approach. With a new workout video published regularly, it suggests a routine and discipline element. However, the moderate intensity implied keeps the score at 0.5.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded, as the workout is specifically described as 'easy' and suitable for bed-ridden users, which contrasts these spirits' typical vigorous and athletic characteristics."
