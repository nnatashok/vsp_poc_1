  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.7 due to its description as an 'intense full body dumbbell workout' paired with elements like 'burn fat, burn calories' and mentions of HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) in the channel description. The presence of an 'intense' and 'effective' approach aimed at maximizing effort and calorie burning supports this classification.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is excluded as the workout doesn't emphasize smooth, continuous movement patterns driven by a musical rhythm. Therefore, no strong evidence supports this spirit.\n\n'High-Intensity' is complemented by 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.6, indicated by the workout's clear programming and focus on compound movements and techniques at 'a slow to moderate tempo per rep,' suggesting an organized approach to strength training.\n\n'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to lack of sports-specific skills or outdoor elements. 'Soothing & Restorative' is also excluded as the workout is explicitly intense rather than focused on relaxation or recovery."
