  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "Based on the metadata provided for this 'Standing Cardio Workout,' it appears that no specific equipment is required. The title and description emphasize it as a 'standing cardio workout' and a 'standing pilates cardio workout,' suggesting that it's primarily a bodyweight routine. There are no mentions of equipment in the title, tags, or description that would suggest the need for anything specific, such as mats or weights. The video is focused on a low-impact, high-intensity workout that involves standing exercises without jumping. User comments also don't reference any equipment use. Given these points, it's reasonable to conclude that the workout can be performed using bodyweight only."
