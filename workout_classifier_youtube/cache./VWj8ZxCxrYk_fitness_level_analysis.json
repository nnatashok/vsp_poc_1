The comments and description emphasize it being suitable for beginners, and the lack of equipment further supports a basic technique requirement. Despite the few comments indicating challenge, the emphasis remains on the workout being designed for beginners.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 17:39, which is relatively short but allows for a moderate level of physical exertion, as expressed in multiple comments noting fatigue and the need to build endurance. The 'low impact' nature indicated by the tags suggests a lower energy expenditure, aligning with a light to moderate effort level for deconditioned users. Viewer feedback shows some users find it challenging, but it is structured to be manageable for beginners over time.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is explicitly labeled for beginners and described as a 'beginner workout', indicating it targets those new to fitness. Comments corroborate this, with beginners finding it challenging but achievable, and some progress from initial difficulty to completion without breaks. While certain users experience difficulty, the structure and marketing of the workout strongly suggest it is intended for beginners. However, the exertion level observed from feedback allows for a consideration of lower intermediate fitness levels as well."
