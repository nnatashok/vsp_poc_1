  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of 'The Zen Flow' was chosen due to the strong emphasis on meditation, relaxation, and breath-centered practices as evident in the title ('Guided Meditation'), description, and tags ('Zen', 'Yoga', 'Spirit Guides'), which suggest a grounding and intentional experience. This vibe scores 1.0 because the video's purpose is explicitly about achieving a relaxed and meditative state, consistent with 'Zen Flow' experiences.\n\nThe video also fits 'The Deep Recharge' vibe with a score of 0.7. The description discusses relaxation and support, aligning with the theme of a nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement. The suggestion to find a comfortable, uninterrupted space further supports this classification. \n\nLastly, 'The Reboot Workout' is a relevant but slightly less central vibe, with a score of 0.6. The focus on appreciation, relaxation, and meeting spirit guides for support aligns with a full-body mental refresh and low-stress rejuvenation, typical of 'Reboot' sessions aimed at total-body refreshment.\n\nThe exclusion of more intense or physically demanding vibes is due to the absence of such elements in both the content and context of this guided meditation."
