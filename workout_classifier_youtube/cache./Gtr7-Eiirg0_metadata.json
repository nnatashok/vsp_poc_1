    "Did this workout for the first time and 20 mins just flew by!",
    "I&#39;ve been doing your work outs for about a month ish, try to do a minimum of 3 per week most weeks I manage 5, I mix it up but I have my favorites. This past week I&#39;ve noticed I&#39;ve got some definition in my biceps and triceps for the first time in my life. Even my husband noticed it without me pointing it out.  I love the simplicity of the moves whilst also feeling how well they&#39;re working each muscle. I dont find I&#39;m having to force myself to work out like I have in the past. Thanks for creating amazing content \u2764",
    "Damn y\u2019all dk how much she makes my day whenever she posts a new video \ud83d\ude02\u2764 Her workout videos are honestly one of the few that I don\u2019t dread and can make myself do even on mentally tough days because they\u2019re easy to follow and not overly complicated but still challenging nonetheless.",
    "more standing full body would be great. Love your workouts!",
    "Loving the workouts. Love the fact they\u2019re standing too. Keep up the great work x"
