  "description": "Standing Cardio Workout | No Jumping | Includes Warm Up and Cool Down Stretch | 30 Minutes\n\nJoin me for a 30 minute standing pilates cardio workout. With a warm up, more intense exercises in the middle and lovely stretch to finish. This will raise your heart rate, burn fat, tone muscles and put a smile on your face as we move through low impact, high intensity and fun exercises to boost the metabolism and leave you feeling energised and raring to go. A great session to get going in the morning and I recommend you do this at least three times a week to see and feel the difference in your body. \n\nDo check out my other high energy workouts here: \n\n30 Minute Standing Cardio Pilates + Abs https://youtu.be/HauHdwahJvM\n\n15 Minute Standing Pilates for Strong Legs https://youtu.be/gX23jrqY_nk\n\n14 Minute Standing Pilates and Barre Workout: https://youtu.be/PWbRI5PqV2I\n\nThis is a new 'exercise only' edit of a previous livestream.

    "I thought maybe this will be too much for my 74y old bones, but I did it all!  - well, except: those one-knee-on-the-floor-and-rotate thingies in the last maybe 5 minutes. I want to take this one to my besties - have to think of something to replace the knee-thingies :-) . Thank you Rachel, you make my life so much better with your work.",
