  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"10 Minute Full Body Stretch & Mobility: (For Daily Routine or Pre/Post Workout)\" appears to require no equipment based on the metadata provided. The description emphasizes that the routine can be done anywhere and targets common tight areas without needing additional support, implying a bodyweight-focused series of stretches. The tags and comments focus on stretching, flexibility, and relaxation but do not indicate the use of specific items like mats or blocks. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this workout is structured to be performed with just bodyweight and does not require any particular equipment. The workout is classified as \"bodyweight only\" due to the absence of terms or mentions indicating equipment usage. The customization aspect of the routine mentioned also supports an adaptable practice without fixed equipment requirements."
