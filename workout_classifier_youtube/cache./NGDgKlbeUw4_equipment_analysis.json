  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata of the video indicates a focus on Pilates, which typically involves floor exercises that are best performed on a soft surface. The description explicitly mentions 'Mat from Liforme', and a discount link provided suggests that a mat is not only recommended but actively promoted for purchase, making it central to the workout. The mention of 'Full Body Workout combining Pilates principles/movements' reinforces that many exercises are floor-based and require a mat for comfort and performance. Therefore, the confidence level that a mat is required is very high at 0.9."
