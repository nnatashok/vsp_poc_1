  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'HIIT' with a score of 0.95, as indicated explicitly by the title ('20 Min Fat Burning HIIT Workout') and reinforced by the tags and description such as 'hiit workout,' 'cardio hiit workout,' and '20 min hiit'. The description also specifies HIIT characteristics, including interval training ('45s on / 15s Rest'), which is a hallmark of HIIT workouts. The 'Body weight' category is assigned with a score of 0.65 due to the workout being 'No Equipment,' as stated in the title and description. This indicates exercises that likely use body weight for resistance. While the standing nature could suggest a 'Mat' workout, the emphasis on HIIT and the structure of the workout, including squats and lunges as mentioned in comments, supports a stronger association with 'Body weight.' There are no indicators suggesting categories such as 'Treadmill,' 'Elliptical,' or others, thus excluding them from consideration."
