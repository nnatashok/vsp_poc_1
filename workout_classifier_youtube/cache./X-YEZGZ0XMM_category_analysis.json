  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is primarily categorized under 'Calisthenics' due to multiple direct references in the title, tags, and description to calisthenics exercises (e.g., 'calisthenics upper body workout,' 'calisthenics series'). The score of 0.9 reflects the strong emphasis on calisthenics exercises, explicit mentions, and the overall focus of the workout on bodyweight movements in a structured format involving multiple superset exercises.\n\nThe 'Body weight' category is also highly relevant, with a score of 0.8, as the workout is described as 'bodyweight only,' and all exercises listed in the description (e.g., push-ups, planks, dips) involve using body weight for resistance. The frequent use of terms such as 'bodyweight exercise' and 'no equipment workout' in the tags further supports this classification.\n\nAlthough the workout could loosely fit elements of 'Strength training' due to the focus on upper body strength, the lack of weights or machines keeps it aligned with bodyweight categories, eliminating the 'Weight workout' category. Overall, the metadata and context strongly support calisthenics and bodyweight as the primary categories."
