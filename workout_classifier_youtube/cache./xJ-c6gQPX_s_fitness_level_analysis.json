  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is labeled as a 'third trimester prenatal cardio workout', indicating it is designed for individuals during a specific pregnancy stage. Prenatal workouts generally feature controlled, simple movements to ensure safety, earning a Beginner score of 0.8. The presence of slight complexity and potential modifications for different fitness levels justifies an Intermediate score of 0.2, as prenatal exercises can sometimes require mindfulness and slight adaptation, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy.",
