Tags like 'running workout for beginners' and 'intermediate running workout' suggest varying difficulty levels are accounted for. While beginners and intermediates can handle treadmill running, those with more experience are likely to manage the variation in speed and incline. Thus, it's rated between beginner and intermediate for technique difficulty.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulty, this workout suits multiple fitness levels. While the technique is manageable by beginners, the demanding nature of a continuous 60-minute treadmill session, with intense intervals, makes it realistically more suited for intermediate levels upwards. The advanced level is appropriate considering the endurance challenge and the pace variations. Elite runners may also benefit due to the workout's potential to build endurance. Community feedback supports that even seasoned users find value, further justifying multiple fitness levels."
