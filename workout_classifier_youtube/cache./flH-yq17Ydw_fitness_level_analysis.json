  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises listed in the workout, such as arm crossovers, arm circles, squat, side lunges, knee push-ups, and bicycle crunches, are mostly beginner-friendly bodyweight movements that require minimal coordination or complex technique. The description explicitly labels the workout as 'easy' and suitable for beginners, further supporting a 'Beginner' classification. The presence of slightly more complex exercises like lunges and knee push-ups, which require some balance and form awareness, offers a mild alignment with the 'Intermediate' level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 29 minutes long, placing it in a range that can be moderately challenging for beginners, especially since it targets full body engagement. The exercises are performed with intervals of exertion and rest, coupled with bodyweight movements that are generally less intense but still require consistent effort across the duration. Tags like 'full body fat burn' and 'daily cardio' suggest a workout designed to increase heart rate and support weight loss. The user comments about consistent improvements (e.g., weight loss) also indicate moderate physical demand, with a mild suggestion toward 'Challenging', reflecting potential cumulative fatigue.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Combining the 'Beginner' level technique difficulty with the moderate effort required for a 29-minute routine, this workout is strongly aligned with those new to exercise but also incorporates an intermediate fitness level for those who find longer durations slightly challenging. The channel's emphasis on simple, equipment-free routines also supports inclusivity of both beginner and intermediate users, since users can adjust pacing or form to increase intensity. Some exercises like lunges and push-ups offer options to elevate the workout's complexity, which is reflected in the slight 'Advanced' alignment due to duration and user flexibility in pushing limits."
