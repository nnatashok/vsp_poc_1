  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 1,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as 'Light' with high confidence. Guided meditations typically require very low energy expenditure, as they mostly involve calm breathing and mental focus rather than physical activity. The 30-minute duration is sustained by mental concentration more than physical endurance, as evidenced by the emphasis on grounding and relaxation in the description and tags. Viewer comments also suggest a gentle and calming experience, reinforcing this classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is 'Beginner' with some 'Intermediate' alignment. Guided meditations are fundamentally accessible to all fitness levels because they do not involve physically exertive actions. However, because this meditation spans 30 minutes, individuals unfamiliar with prolonged mental focus or meditative practice might find it slightly challenging, justifying a minor alignment with 'Intermediate.' The comments suggest accessibility and a positive experience even for those who find longer meditations challenging, indicating a broad suitability."
