  "vibesExplanation": "The video, titled \"30 min Beginner Yoga - Full Body Yoga Stretch No Props Needed\", is primarily characterized by a 'Zen Flow' vibe with a score of 0.9. This is supported by several factors: the mention of 'slow flow yoga' in the tags, the focus on breath and relaxation, and the overall calming energy reported by viewers in comments like \"gentle and accepting energy\" and the reminder to \"relax and breathe\". The presence of terms like 'stress and anxiety alleviation' further supports this vibe.\n\nThe secondary vibe 'Reboot Workout' scores 0.7, as this practice offers a 'total-body refresh' through gentle stretching. It is designed for improving flexibility and building foundational strength, which matches the idea of a low-stress, refreshing experience as indicated by comments from users who appreciated the relaxation and supportive teaching style.\n\nOther potential vibes such as 'Meditative Grind' are less relevant because the focus is not on endurance or repetition but more on a peaceful, restorative experience, which aligns more directly with 'Zen Flow' and 'Reboot Workout.' The confidence in these classifications is high, based on explicit content in the title, description, and comments."
