  "title": "10 MIN Full Body Calisthenics Workout For Beginners (On The Bars)",
  "description": "This workout was designed for callisthenics beginners. Every exercise can be regressed or adjusted according to your specific level.  If you want to build strength and endurance, you should be doing these types of workouts. 10 minutes is a good starting point, but I suggest repeating this circuit 2 or 3 times. You can also use this circuit to get your body warmed up before finishing your workout with more reps and sets.  I will post additional rep-based workouts soon.  My goal for this page is to help you learn the sport I love in the safest and most effective way possible.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde1\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd9\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde0 \ud835\uddec\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddec\ud835\udde6\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde4\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\uddea\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddb \ud835\udddd\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddec\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddec\ud835\uddea\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddda\ud835\udddb\ud835\udde7 \ud83d\udd25\nPROJECT SHRED  is my newest program that uses all of my top callisthenics training techniques to get you shredded and help you build healthy habits that positively impact your lifestyle.  \nCheck it out! \u25ba https://calxthenics.com\n\nMY SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25ba Follow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/adam_frater/\n\u25ba Subscribe to my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd8s...\n\nRELATED CALISTHENICS VIDEOS:\n\u25ba How To Muscle Up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpny7...\n\u25ba How To Do Russian Dips:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFEVe...\n\u25ba 5 Best Exercises For Shredded Abs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryvwR...\n\u25baHow To Start Calisthenics at Home for Beginners (No Equipment): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEXjX...\n\nIN THIS CALISTHENICS VIDEO: \nI show you what a proper calisthenics workout looks like for beginners.
