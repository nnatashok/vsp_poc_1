  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises include a range of technique difficulties. Several exercises like dumbbell squats and plank variations are of intermediate technique, requiring some coordination and balance. Bulgarian split squats and single-leg variations demand more balance and stability, placing them at an advanced level for users unfamiliar with these movements. While exercises like sumo squats are relatively simple, the inclusion of jumping exercises like squat jumps and lunge jumps further pushes the difficulty to an advanced level for maintained proper form.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes exercises that can be adjusted in intensity with dumbbells. Exercises like single-leg heel raises and planks are of moderate effort, suitable for basic strength training. However, plyometric movements like squat jumps and lunge jumps elevate the exertion to a challenging level. The 13-minute duration helps moderate the effort difficulty, as it's not overly long but does involve sustained intensity with minimal rest noted.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on technique and effort difficulties, this workout is best suited for intermediate users. The presence of both simpler movements and more complex, balance-demanding exercises implies a good fit for those with moderate experience. Advanced users can benefit from the more challenging exercises like the rotary stability plank and plyometrics. Beginners, while able to attempt some exercises, might find certain movements too complex, reflected in a lower score. The trainer's support and potential for modification provide some accessibility for beginners."
