  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Full Body Mobility Stretches by Daniel Giordano' focuses on a full-body mobility exercise designed to relieve muscle tension and improve joint mobility. The description and tags emphasize stretching and mobility exercises without mentioning any specific workout equipment. Additionally, there are no references in the metadata to any particular equipment being used or needed, such as mats or blocks, which might sometimes be associated with stretching routines. Based on this information, it appears that the exercises are likely bodyweight only, requiring no additional equipment to perform. Consequently, the required equipment for this workout has been classified as an empty array, indicating a bodyweight-only routine."
