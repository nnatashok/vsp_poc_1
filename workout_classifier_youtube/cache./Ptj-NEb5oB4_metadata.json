    "I love doing this workout every morning, honestly it gets me energised.",
    "Was short on time but wanted to do a quick stretch this morning to feel ground and get my day going. Glad I found this one. Thanks so much!",
    "bruh i came into this with few expectations (just wanted to quikcly stretch before a run) but your style of instruction is so amazing. I love how there are almost no pauses and everything flows into the next stretch rather than resetting to start the next stretch. Also the variety is great. You are definetly not boring. Thanks for the great stretch ill come again. (:"
