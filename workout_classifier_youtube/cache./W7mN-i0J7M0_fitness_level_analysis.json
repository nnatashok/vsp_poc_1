  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout focuses on bodyweight exercises aimed at gaining weight, suggesting simplicity in movements suitable for beginners, as indicated by the comments and tags like 'no equipment workout' and 'home workout'. There's no complex equipment or intricate choreography mentioned, which suggests that the exercises focus on straightforward bodyweight movements. Although the term 'intense' is used, this can refer to effort rather than technique. Some exercises like lunges, as mentioned in the warm-up, require coordination, thus the intermediate level is included but with moderate confidence.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video's duration is 14:37, indicating a moderate level of effort required, especially with the absence of equipment allowing for self-pacing. Tags suggest it as an 'intense' workout which would imply a workout session of moderate intensity given the short duration. User comments mentioning difficulty and intensity also suggest that, for the specially targeted audience (those looking to gain weight), this level of effort might be challenging. However, it remains unsuitable for extreme levels due to its overall design as a home workout aimed at a broad audience.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the moderate effort and beginner to intermediate technique difficulty, this workout is suitable for beginners, particularly those struggling with weight gain, as the description and comments indicate. The short duration supports the inclusion of beginners. The 'intense' tag supports higher levels as well, especially if performed with higher energy output or repetition, thereby also categorizing it as intermediate and to a lesser extent, advanced, for those who might add supplementary weights or repeat the session for increased difficulty. The description advises consulting a doctor, hinting at an effort level that might challenge beginners."
