  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video \"CALISTHENICS GLUTES & HAMSTRINGS WORKOUT - Bodyweight Only | Day Three\" by Caroline Girvan is primarily characterized by the \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit, scoring 0.9. The description highlights a methodical approach: the workout requires precise techniques and alignment, such as \"mind to muscle connection,\" and follows a specific protocol with a timer set for 45 seconds of work and 20 seconds of rest between sets. This structure and attention to detail in form and movement precision is indicative of a highly disciplined workout.\n\n\"High-Energy & Intense\" is also applicable, scoring 0.7. The description mentions the intense nature of the session, with phrases like \"intense session\" and \"deceivingly challenging,\" and comments echoing the difficulty and effectiveness of the exercises (e.g., feeling the burn from hamstring lifts and reverse plank lifts). While the workout is indeed intense, it's not the explosive or fast-paced intensity typical of high-energy sessions but is still physically challenging and demanding.\n\nFlow, soothing, sport, and outdoor spirits were excluded due to the lack of emphasis on rhythmic movement, relaxation, sports-specific training, or nature-based workouts."
