    "Doing your workouts for almost a year now and can clearly see the results. Been doing it in Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta and CDMX, Mexico and Cologne, Munich and Berlin in Germany and in Malta and Paris, France. It truly travels the globe with me! Thanku for your great work!",
    "49 yr old. I do tai chi regularly, and I started doing other types of excercies recently again, because it is getting more and more important for me to keep muscle mass in this age, so I googled for some home workout plan. I wanted sg that doesn&#39;t require weights, because I started doing excercies with smaller, for-home-use dumbbells too and I was looking for a plan for the days when I don&#39;t use dumbbells and a plan that would work the deeper muscles better.<br>Your channel was among the first 10 hits, I clicked on you first. I have just finished this routine. <br>In my opinion I gained enough experience to form a judgment and I found your program just appropriate for my goals.  Thx!",
    "Woman, 43, Sweden here. Just starting with calisthenics and I love it!",
    "Spent 8 years in the United States Marine Corps. Got out and haven\u2019t worked out since. Finally decided to get off my lazy ass and from behind my desk job and start doing some proper calisthenics. Gotta say, this is some PROPER Marine Corps stuff here. Thanks brother!",
    "First time I tried it just now. Out of breath. It is a solid workout. I feel strong yet challenged in every set. Big cheers from Sweden!"
