  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is characterized by a focus on technique and skill-building, with specific references to form corrections and prompts in the top comments indicating a detailed and instructional approach. This aligns with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe, which is further supported by Nicole's certifications and expert guidance mentioned in the channel description. The score of 0.75 reflects this strong alignment.\n\nAdditionally, the workout's slower pace, emphasis on breath control, and inclusivity for all levels suggest elements of 'The Zen Flow.' The description mentions a \"slower paced class\" designed \"to cater to all levels,\" indicating a grounding and intentional approach typical of 'The Zen Flow.' Therefore, it is assigned a score of 0.6, recognizing a moderate but evident match with this vibe.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Groove Session' or 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' were considered but not selected due to the lack of emphasis on beat-driven movement or fluid dance-like elements. The feedback and teaching style contribute to a well-grounded analysis with high confidence in the chosen vibes."
