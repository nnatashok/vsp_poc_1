  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is primarily classified as a 'Weight workout' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This classification is strongly supported by the title and tags, which emphasize strength training and the use of dumbbells (e.g., '40 MIN STRENGTH Workout With Weights,' 'Dumbbell workout,' 'Full body strength workout'). The detailed description outlines exercises that utilize dumbbells, indicating this is a central aspect of the workout.\n\nThe video also fits into the 'HIIT' category with a score of 0.7 due to the structure of alternating exercise and rest periods (50 seconds on, 10 seconds off), which are typical of high-intensity interval training. Tags like 'Full body hiit with weights,' 'Hiit workout,' and 'Killer hiit' further reinforce this classification.\n\nAdditionally, 'Body weight' exercises are present, though they are a less prominent component, as evidenced by exercises like jumping jacks and plank moves mentioned in the description, warranting a score of 0.4. Other categories like 'Mat' or 'Calisthenics' were considered but excluded, as the presence of weights and HIIT format were more defining of this workout. Overall, the workout's focus on strength with weights as well as its HIIT format are strongly indicated."
