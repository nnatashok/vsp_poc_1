  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists largely of straightforward movements like side crunches, squat side bends, skiers with floor touches, and side leg raises, which align with Beginner-level technique difficulty. These exercises are basic and require minimal coordination or special skills. However, the inclusion of movements like curtsy lunge to crunch and squat to side crunch introduces a small level of complexity, explaining the slight Intermediate score.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is only 10 minutes long and consists of exercises that primarily emphasize muscle engagement and gentle cardiovascular activity rather than high energy output, aligning more with Light effort difficulty. However, due to the inclusion of continuing movements like squats to toe touch and skiers, there is moderately increased energy expenditure, thus contributing to a moderate score under Effort Difficulty for those less conditioned.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the combination of technique and effort difficulties, this workout is highly suitable for beginners. The technique is predominantly beginner-friendly, and the effort required is light for all users. However, the presence of slightly more complex movements warrants a minor inclusion of Intermediate fitness levels. Comments from users highlighting effectiveness and light challenge further support the potential for those slightly above beginner to benefit from it as well."
