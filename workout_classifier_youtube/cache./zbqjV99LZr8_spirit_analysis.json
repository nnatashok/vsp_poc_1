  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.8. This decision is supported by the title and tags such as 'Fat Burning,' 'HIIT workout,' and 'Cardio HIIT,' indicating a vigorous and high-effort session. The comment 'Brutal. The squat pulses killed me' further suggests the workout's intense nature. Despite being low-impact with no jumping, it still emphasizes a challenging tempo and calorie burn ('Calorie Burn \u223c 300').\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit scores a 0.6 due to the 'Intervals: 45s on / 15s Rest' specification, illustrating a methodical approach to the workout, along with set intervals and focus on how to efficiently execute exercises for results. The use of terms like 'all standing' and 'no equipment' reflects a structured session design intended to target specific workout variables effectively.\n\nLastly, 'Flow & Rhythm' scores 0.4 due to the continuous movement and full-body focus that could facilitate a degree of rhythm and coordination, as mentioned in the description 'perfect for a low-impact, full-body session.' Other potential spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' were not applicable due to the workout\u2019s focus on high-energy, indoor, non-restorative activities."
