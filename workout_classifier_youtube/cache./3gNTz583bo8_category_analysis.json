Additionally, top comments frequently mention Pilates, with viewers expressing enjoyment and benefits related to Pilates-specific outcomes, like improved posture and muscle tone. The description's mention of it being a 'peaceful and energising 20 minutes of movement' aligns well with Pilates' focus on controlled, mindful exercises.
