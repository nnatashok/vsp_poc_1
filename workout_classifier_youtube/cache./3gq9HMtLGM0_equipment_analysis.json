  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a yoga flow session titled \"20 Minute Everyday Yoga Flow\" and comes from a channel dedicated to yoga instruction. The description mentions a \"vinyasa flow\" which is a style of yoga that typically includes various poses performed on a mat. While the exact mention of a mat is absent from the description, yoga practices are generally performed on one, particularly for exercises involving floor contact such as backbends or hip openers. The confidence score of 0.9 reflects the near-certainty that a mat is required, given the context and standard practice in yoga."
