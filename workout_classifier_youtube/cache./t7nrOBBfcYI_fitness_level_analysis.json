  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the use of simple, family-friendly exercises, the 'Beginner' level is primarily targeted. However, considering the involvement of parents, 'Intermediate' is included to acknowledge adults might still find it mildly engaging, especially if they're not accustomed to regular activity. The workout's duration exceeding 10 minutes supports a minimal bump to Intermediate for those transitioning from completely sedentary to moderately active."
