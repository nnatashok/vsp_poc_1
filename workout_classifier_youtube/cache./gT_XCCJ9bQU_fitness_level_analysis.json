  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a standing workout with no jumping, which indicates relatively simple movements. Tags like 'quiet cardio' and 'apartment friendly' suggest minimal coordination is required, suitable for beginners. However, the inclusion of the term 'full body workout' and multiple component areas such as arms, legs, and abs imply a mix of simple and slightly more coordinated movements, thus also touching on the intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 31-minute duration and description of the workout as 'full body fat loss' and 'cardio workout' suggest a moderate level of effort. Phrases like 'fat burn' and 'lose belly fat' indicate sustained, moderate intensity, making it moderately demanding. Comments also reflect effort with users describing physical exertion (e.g., 'fighting for my life'). The 'no jumping' approach keeps it accessible, but the length and fat-burning goal make it challenging for beginners.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The combination of standing exercises with no jumping denotes beginner accessibility, yet the full body and cardio elements delivered in a continuous 30-minute session increase the required fitness level to intermediate. Considering the workout's length and fat loss emphasis, advanced users can also find it engaging, especially as they may self-regulate intensity by adjusting pace. User comments regarding challenges for newcomers and mid-level fitness enthusiasts reinforce the need for various fitness levels."
