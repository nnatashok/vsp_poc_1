  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit identified for this video is \"Flow & Rhythm,\" which aligns with the \"Healthy Energy Flow\" mentioned in both the title and description, emphasizing smooth, continuous movement patterns. The video focuses on alignment, action, and sensation, which are indicative of a coordinated practice that encourages a mind-body connection. This spirit is further supported by the music-driven component common in yoga sessions, as evident from the mention of music by Shakey Graves.\n\n\"Soothing & Restorative\" is also a relevant spirit due to the gentle, healing nature of yoga practice that aims to cultivate a sustainable flow of energy, as described in the metadata. Although the emphasis is on weight loss and muscle toning, which could suggest a more intense spirit, the comments and overall channel description highlight a welcoming, supportive atmosphere, characteristic of restorative practices.\n\n\"High-Energy & Intense\" was considered but excluded due to the video's focus on sustainability rather than high intensity, as well as the presence of an audience spanning older age groups seeking a gentler engagement with exercise."
