  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique required for this workout is primarily related to basic and intermediate cycling. Indoor cycling on a stationary bike involves simple pedaling which can be mastered by beginners, but achieving optimal performance with cadence and speed adjustments requires intermediate level coordination. The absence of technical maneuvers or complex forms keeps it accessible, but maintaining proper cycling form for extended periods introduces some complexity more fitting for intermediates.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 60-minute duration indicates a high effort level, especially with the three hills format which simulates increased resistance and climbing, leading to a challenging cardiovascular demand. Moderate effort applies due to potential pacing adjustments for less fit users, but overall, the workout can become challenging for deconditioned users. The long duration also hints at a higher energy expenditure further supporting the challenging level classification, with some sections potentially reaching extreme levels for untrained individuals.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the effort difficulty and technique, this workout suits multiple levels. While beginners can potentially attempt it, they are likely to find it quite challenging due to its duration and simulated hill climbs. The intermediate level is a strong fit given the moderate technique and challenging effort, while those with more experience might handle the intensity better. The community feedback suggests older or less experienced users can participate, albeit potentially at a slower pace or with adjustments, supporting a wide range of required fitness levels."
