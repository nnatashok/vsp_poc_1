  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily focused on strength training exercises targeted at beginners and seniors, as indicated by both the title \"STRENGTH TRAINING for BEGINNERS\" and the numerous specific tags such as \"strength training for beginners\", \"strength training for seniors\", and \"senior strength training\". The description further elaborates that the exercises involve using weights, as viewers are encouraged to use heavier weights than usual. This is reinforced by viewer comments expressing continuation with weight exercises and mentioning muscles building, a clear indication of weight-oriented exercises. Since the video's primary focus is on resistance exercises using weights to build strength, the 'Weight workout' category is most suitable. Other categories were considered, but elements such as Yoga, Pilates, or Mat exercises were not mentioned, nor were there indications of high-intensity intervals or use of specific equipment beyond basic weights."
