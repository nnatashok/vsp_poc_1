  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The metadata suggests that the exercises are generally accessible, aligning with beginner to intermediate levels. The tags and description include terms like 'morning yoga for beginners' and 'mobility', indicating simple poses that awaken the body. However, elements like 'wake up your core' and 'strengthening routine' suggest slightly more delicate movements that require some coordination and attention to form, elevating the effort to intermediate for some parts of the routine.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 21:47 minutes with a focus on gentle awakening of the body suggests a light level of effort. User comments describe emotional and physiological intensity ('I cried', 'absolutely rocked'), but the presence of phrases like 'peaceful mind', 'juicy breath-centric', and 'strong muscle tone' denotes a primary focus on mindfulness and gentle engagement rather than intense exertion. A moderate score reflects potential for deeper engagement depending on personal execution.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering both the technique and effort difficulty, this yoga flow is primarily accessible to beginners but offers potential for intermediate engagement, evident from user feedback stating personal intensity and integration into daily practice. Reference to 'all levels' supports broad accessibility. Advanced practitioners may find benefit in deeper exploration of postures or using the session as a recovery or mindfulness practice, hence a score for this level."
