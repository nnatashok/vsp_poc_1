    "Welcome back GCN! I\u2019ve dropped 25 lbs in the past year thanks to these sessions and a renewed commitment to cycling. (And not eating like a teenager.)  Looking forward to new sessions in the coming year to keep things fresh.",
    "Best ten minutes of the day so far :-)",
    "Manon is the best presenter in these workouts. Keep her around!",
    "These workouts are great.  I&#39;m recovering from an ankle injury, and these sessions give me a great cardio workout - especially when I&#39;m short on time and have to get a workout in.  So grateful for the multiple sprint sessions - and to see everyone working out just as hard keeps me going.  Thank you!"
