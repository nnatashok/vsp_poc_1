  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video, \"At Home Core Workout | Clutch Life: Ashley Conrad's 24/7 Fitness Trainer,\" classifies strongly as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.75. The description emphasizes pushing yourself, with phrases like \"feel challenged,\" \"heart should be racing,\" and \"you should be sweating,\" which indicates a high-intensity workout designed to push physical limits. The structure outlined in the timestamps and circuit nature of the workout supports the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, which is given a score of 0.7 due to its organized nature using circuits, rounds, and minimal breaks.\n\nThe emphasis on continuous movement with minimal rest also introduces elements of 'Flow & Rhythm,' scoring 0.5, as it involves smooth sequences of exercises that can create a rhythmic flow. However, the primary focus remains on intensity and discipline. The Bodybuilding.com channel's emphasis on structured fitness routines further supports these classifications. Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' do not fit this workout's characteristics."
