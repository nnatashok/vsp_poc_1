    "Love Tasha! I&#39;ve been doing Fitness Blender workouts for 5+ years and Tasha is an awesome addition! Loved this one! And now, some lunch :)",
    "I have been using FB for 6 years and Tasha is their absolute best trainer. I&#39;m so glad she joined and providing these excellent videos. She is just in a league of her own.",
    "This was the first workout from Tasha that I did and I love her! Love her little jokes and comments throughout the workout.. lightens the mood!",
    "Oh wow this lady is the full package! She can do modifications without missing a beat in explaining them and staying with the timer. While still sounding enthused. Where did this team find her!? I&#39;m definitely going to be doing this one for sure. I hope she will have more full body strength workouts coming. Hell I&#39;ll be satisfied with whatever she adds. Great addition team!",
    "This was my first workout with Tasha-love her! Her low key demeanor is my style. I like that she gives a heads up for the next move. She kept my heart rate up the whole time. Great addition to FB!"
