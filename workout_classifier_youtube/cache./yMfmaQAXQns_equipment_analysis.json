  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled \"30 Minute Spin\u00ae Class: High Intensity CALORIE TORCHER,\" indicating that the workout is a spin class, which requires an exercise bike. The description further emphasizes that it is a spin/indoor cycling workout with hills, sprints, and jumps, all of which are terms associated with stationary bike workouts. Additionally, tags like \"spinning class,\" \"indoor cycling,\" and \"stationary bike workout\" reinforce that an exercise bike is central to the workout. High confidence (0.9) is assigned because the exercise bike is foundational to performing the described spin class effectively, and there are repeated explicit mentions in the metadata."
