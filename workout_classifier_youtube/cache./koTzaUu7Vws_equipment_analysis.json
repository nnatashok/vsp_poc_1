  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "This is a 40-minute full body Pilates workout, which heavily implies the use of a mat, as Pilates exercises typically require a comfortable surface for performing various movements, especially for floor work and core exercises. The title and description do not explicitly mention a mat, but it is common for Pilates classes, especially at an intermediate level, as they are frequently done on the floor. No other equipment like resistance bands or dumbbells is mentioned or suggested in the title, description, or tags, reinforcing the likelihood that this is primarily a mat-based routine. The use of a mat is highly likely given the nature of Pilates being floor-based and aiming to strengthen the core and legs."
