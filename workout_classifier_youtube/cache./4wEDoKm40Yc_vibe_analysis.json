  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for 'Equal Breathing Exercise for Sleep' is 'The Sleep Prep' due to its explicit focus on preparing the body and mind for sleep through a calming exercise, clearly stated in both the title and description. The confidence level is very high (0.9) given it aligns perfectly with the intended purpose. User comments, like the one indicating falling asleep shortly after the exercise, support the effectiveness of the sleep aid aspect.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Deep Recharge' is applicable as it involves nervous system calming, indicated by comments describing emotional release (e.g., crying) and stress reduction during family disturbances. This suggests the workout offers a soothing, restorative experience, aligning with the deep recharge vibe at a moderately high score of 0.75.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Comfort Moves' were considered but excluded due to their less specific emphasis on sleep preparation and nervous system recovery."
