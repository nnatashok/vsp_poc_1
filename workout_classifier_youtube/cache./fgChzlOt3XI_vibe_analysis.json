  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled \"Guided MEDITATION To Reconnect & Recharge\" suggests a calming, restorative experience, which aligns with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe, characterized by ultra-gentle movement and nervous system reset, indicated by terms like 'Reconnect & Recharge' in the title and 'inner strength,' 'relax,' and 'visualise' in the description. The guidance aims to provide relaxation and inner strength, which is strongly supported by comments discussing profound emotional and spiritual healing effects, such as feeling closer to one's soul and experiencing healing tears. The steady duration also supports a meditative, calming practice. \n\n'Zen Flow' was chosen as a secondary vibe due to the breath-centered, intentional nature of the guided meditation. This is indicated by the focus on visualizing and feeling each thought to regain inner power, typical of mindfulness and slow, intentional practices, justifying the 0.7 score.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' were considered but excluded, as the content was more transformative and relaxing rather than a repetitive endurance meditation."
