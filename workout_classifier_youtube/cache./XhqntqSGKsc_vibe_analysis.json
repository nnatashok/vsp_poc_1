  "vibesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as 'The Comfort Moves' with a high score of 0.9 due to its focus on accommodating prenatal needs and being safe across all trimesters, as emphasized in the title, description, and comments. The repeated emphasis on safety and comfort in both the channel's ethos and video description aligns with creating a 'safe, cozy, feel-good movement.' The second vibe, 'The Reboot Workout,' scoring 0.7, is supported by the gentle nature of the pregnancy-specific exercises designed to refresh and support pregnant individuals, particularly given its described purpose of being suitable for 'second trimester' and comments about feeling good post-workout. Lastly, 'The Foundation Builder,' with a score of 0.6, is relevant as the exercises aim to strengthen and prepare the body during pregnancy, addressing core stability and foundational strength as seen in the channel's emphasis on 'Diastasis Recti Safe' workouts and postpartum recovery guidance. Comments from users suggesting long-term baby health and personal wellness goals affirm this supportive foundational aspect."
