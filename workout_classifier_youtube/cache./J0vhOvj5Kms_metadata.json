    "Headline in Washington Post today: It\u2019s never too late to lift weights: Older bodies can still build muscle.<br>Someone wrote in the comments, &quot;I&#39;m 66, how do I start?&quot;  I replied about the YouTube channels that are geared to seniors and/or beginners, and mentioned Yes2Next as an example.  I hope you get some new visitors from that.<br>Thanks for the workouts!",
    "I&#39;m a beginner at 57. I just finished the first session. I&#39;m a little emotional because I have finally done it and broken my procrastination. <br>Your gentle and kind attitude kept me going. I loved it and broke out of my stuck attitude. <br>Thankyou and bless you both.",
    "Thank you for this! I&#39;m a breast cancer survivor and am currently in chemical menopause for the next 5-10 years and my body feels older than I am because of it. I&#39;ve been looking for workouts I can do to loosen up and build muscles back up and there aren&#39;t many. I used to be able to do more and it&#39;s so hard finding workouts that I can do to build my body back up (many are geared toward young, already-in-shape people without joint issues). This was one I could do and gives me so much hope that I can workout and do strength training again.",
    "January 1 2024...Started this year with this exercise.....proud of myself....it is still a struggle to get exercise in.  Thanks to you It&#39;s not as challenging!  Happy New Year!  <br>\u2764\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfba\ud83c\udf89",
