  "description": "This 5 minute breathing exercise is an easy to follow meditation which guides you to tune in to your breathing, letting it be natural and easy. This is for any level of breathwork experience, but especially great for beginners to simply practice what it feels like to be present with and connected to their own breath, a great way to fend off anxiety.",
