  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Meditation' with a score of 1.0 due to the overwhelming focus on a 'guided meditation for self love,' as stated in both the title and throughout the description. Keywords like 'cultivate self love,' 'self confidence,' 'affirmations,' and 'visualization exercises' further strengthen this classification. The tags also include numerous direct references to meditation, increasing confidence. The video is designed for mindfulness and self-improvement, aligning perfectly with meditation.\n\nA secondary category considered is 'Breathing exercises,' given the mention of 'full body relaxation,' which often involves controlled breathing, although it is not explicitly stated. This is assigned a moderate score of 0.5 due to its supporting role in meditation practices.\n\nOther potential categories were not selected as the metadata lacks indications of physical exercise or strength training. The focus on mental relaxation and self-affirmation clearly prioritizes meditation over other forms of exercise."
