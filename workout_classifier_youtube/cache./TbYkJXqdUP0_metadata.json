  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "The best part about this workout was that there were no timers. It was simply you talking to us to switch exercises. Made it even more relaxing. Thank you!",
    "Please give yourselves grace! Professional athletes strut keep up with Pilates classes. I can run on a treadmill and lift weights and this workout was still challenging for me. You are your only competition. Don\u2019t give up on yourself. KEEP GOING!! You\u2019ll be so proud on the other side of your consistency. You\u2019ve got this, friends!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc93\ud83c\udf3a\u2728",
    "I\u2019m completely new at Pilates, and all of your videos challenge me in a low impact way but I feel the burn more than if I had gone to the gym. I\u2019ve tried other Pilates videos, but yours are by far the most structured and direct. They leave me feeling relaxed, stretched, and worked out. I\u2019m finding myself feeling better overall since I started! Thank you so so much for making these videos.",
    "Just finished this and I&#39;m laying here crying on my mat. I&#39;ve been doing your routines 5-6 days a week for maybe 2.5 years now. The past couple months of my life has been so incredibly stressful, I&#39;ve been so depressed and stopped working out, save for going on a walk a couple times a week.<br><br>I wanted to work out today and this is all I had the energy for. I needed this so badly.<br><br>This phase of my life won&#39;t last forever and I have to keep reminding myself of that. Your routines have helped me through some other tough times, they make me feel so much better and comfortable in my skin. Thank you again for being such an amazing instructor. You&#39;ve changed lives and helped so many of us through challenging times. Can&#39;t thank you enough.",
    "Thank you for not having any ads during the workout! I was really able to stay in the zone and release"
