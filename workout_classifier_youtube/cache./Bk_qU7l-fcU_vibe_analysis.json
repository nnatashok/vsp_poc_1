The description mentions 'a tonic for sleep and relaxation,' implying its purpose to prepare for rest, which aligns strongly with this vibe. The mention of 'help ease worries, anxiety and stress' suggests elements of 'The Deep Recharge' vibe (score 0.75), focusing on a nervous system reset through ultra-gentle movement or breathing exercises. Additionally, the guided nature of the meditation, combined with 'Mindfulness' and 'breathing exercise' terms, points to a 'Zen Flow' vibe (score 0.65), emphasizing a grounding and breath-centered experience. The channel's consistent focus on meditation and relaxation further supports these classifications. Other vibes such as 'The Comfort Moves' for children-specific content were considered but not selected due to stronger alignment with meditative and calming themes."
