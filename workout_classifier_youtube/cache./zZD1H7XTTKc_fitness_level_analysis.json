  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises listed, such as Baby Pose, Bridge, Donkey Kicks, Fire Hydrant, Hip Dips, and Cat and Cow, are generally basic movements requiring minimal coordination. These movements generally fall into the beginner category due to their simplicity and accessibility. However, some slightly more complex exercises like Plank Press Back and Leg Drops provide a small element of intermediate difficulty due to increased balance and stability requirements, hence the moderate score for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 16:58 minutes long and consists of low-intensity exercises with frequent rest periods. The tags and description emphasize a routine suitable for \"lazy days,\" implying low energy expenditure. Nonetheless, movements involving multiple muscle groups, such as Bridge and Leg Drops, require a moderate amount of effort for those unaccustomed to exercise, justifying a moderate score as well, albeit secondary to the light intensity classification.",

With the combination of simple technique and low effort levels, it is highly accessible to beginners, with some aspects attracting those at the faintest intermediate level."
