  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified primarily as 'Meditation' due to several key indicators. The title explicitly states '10 Minute Guided Meditation for Focus,' and the description details a focus on mindfulness and breath attention to increase concentration, which aligns with meditation practices. Tags like 'mindful meditation,' 'guided meditation,' and 'mindfulness meditation for focus' further reinforce this categorization. The channel's name, 'Declutter The Mind,' and its description mention meditation practices and mindfulness, solidifying this classification with high confidence (score of 1.0). Additionally, 'Breathing exercises' is considered as a secondary category due to the emphasis on focusing on breath as mentioned in both the description and comments, with a moderate confidence score of 0.7. The strong focus on meditation and breathing, without any elements indicating other workout types, excludes other categories."
