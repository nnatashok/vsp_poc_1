  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated primarily as Beginner (0.8) because utilizing an elliptical involves fairly simple, repetitive movements that require minimal coordination and balance. The workout is described as low-impact and accessible, with the description noting that ellipticals 'don\u2019t take much time to get used to'. There is, however, a slight presence of an Intermediate level (0.4), as coordinating speed and resistance settings require some basic understanding of the equipment controls, as noted by some users' comments regarding adjustment issues.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.75,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as Moderate (0.75) and Challenging (0.55) due to the structured intervals of varying intensities outlined in the workout description. While the RPE scale fluctuates between 6-10, indicating a broad range from moderate to vigorous exertion, the overall 20-minute length with rest periods, and the ability to customize resistance, supports a rating of Moderate for many. The user's feedback of increased endurance over repeated sessions suggests a Challenging aspect, particularly as participants push towards upper RPE levels and higher resistance.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level spans Beginner (0.6), Intermediate (0.8), and Advanced (0.5). Despite being structured for all levels, the mention of resistance modifications and effort maximization indicates that it caters appropriately to Beginners due to modification potential and default machine settings. The Intermediate and Advanced scores recognize the potential for higher resistance, speed, and repetition, as observed by users scaling difficulty through described RPE modifications and personal capability advancements. Comments reflect variability in starting capability and adjustments over time, supporting a multi-level classification."
