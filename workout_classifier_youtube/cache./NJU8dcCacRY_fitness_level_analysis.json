  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video combines Pilates and yoga, suggesting movements that require good coordination, balance, and body awareness. The use of terms like 'fusion' and 'strengthen' indicates movements that are more than basic. Viewer comments mention challenge and focus, pointing towards an intermediate technique difficulty. The resources provided (Yoga/Pilates fusion) require some skill but not to an expert level, hence rating between intermediate and advanced.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 32-minute duration, along with the description of stretching and strengthening, suggests a moderate to challenging effort level. Viewer comments describe the workout as challenging and a 'sweater', indicating higher energy expenditure. However, the calming nature of yoga and Pilates means it is not at an extreme level of effort. Overall, it's reasonably demanding due to duration and sustained engagement required, scoring between moderate and challenging.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering technique and effort difficulty, the workout is most appropriate for intermediate users, with some capability for beginners who can modify according to fitness level. The intermediate level is supported by the combination of technique and consistent effort required over 30 minutes. Advanced users may find some challenge in maintaining form and engagement. Thus, the workout spans beginner to advanced levels, encouraging progression as indicated by comments showing adaptation over time."
