  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled '[Level 1] 10 Minute Bodyweight Workout for Starters' primarily fits the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.7. The title indicates a clear level system, suggesting a methodical approach suitable for beginners. The description mentions a '10 minutes light workout session for beginners' and provides a specific estimated calorie burn, typical of structured workouts. Moreover, user comments highlight its suitability for those at the beginner level, emphasizing its structured nature rather than improvisational or overly intense routines. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit receives a moderate score of 0.5. While the workout is intended as a beginner-friendly routine, it likely involves a smooth, continuous pattern that's easy to follow along, possibly driven by the music mentioned in the description. However, there is limited specific mention of rhythm or music-driven elements in the metadata, leading to moderate confidence in this classification. \n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' are excluded due to the workout's described light nature, and there\u2019s no indication of 'Outdoor & Adventure', 'Sport & Agility', or 'Soothing & Restorative' elements."
