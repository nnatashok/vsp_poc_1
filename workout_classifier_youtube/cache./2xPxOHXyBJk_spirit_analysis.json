  "spiritsExplanation": "The video '15 min Full Body Workout with Dumbbells' by Kaleigh Cohen Strength strongly embodies the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.7. The workout is clearly segmented into three rounds focused on different muscle groups (lower body, upper body, and abs/core), with specific time allocations for work and rest (50 seconds of work, 15 seconds of rest). This methodical structure and the use of a set series of exercises suggest a disciplined approach to strength training, supporting a clear progression and technical focus. \n\nFurthermore, the workout possesses a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit with a score of 0.6. The video emphasizes a total body workout in a short 15-minute duration, which aligns with the comments that describe the session as intense and challenging despite the brief timeframe. Comments highlight the intensity ('slaughtered me,' 'intense 15 minute all over workout'), alluding to a fast-paced and effort-driven experience.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm,' 'Soothing & Restorative,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' have been excluded due to the lack of relevant indicators like fluid, seamless transitions, relaxation focus, or nature-based elements."
