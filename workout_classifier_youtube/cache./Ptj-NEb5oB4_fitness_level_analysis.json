  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is classified as \"Beginner\" with a high confidence level because the workout consists of \"simple stretches\" as mentioned in both the title and tags. The description emphasizes that these are exercises \"anyone can do\" which implies basic techniques. The stretches are intended for broad accessibility, aligning with beginner-level movements. There is some scope for \"Intermediate\" classification due to the presence of a flow between stretches as mentioned in comments, but overall the complexity of the movements is low.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.95,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as \"Light\" with very high confidence because the workout is a 5-minute stretching routine, which inherently involves low energy expenditure. The duration and nature of the exercises are more about relaxation and daily activity initiation than physical exertion. User comments and description emphasize the brief and gentle nature of the routine, aiming to improve energy and stretch muscles, indicating a focus on light activity rather than intensity.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily \"Beginner,\" supported by references to this being accessible for anyone, including tag mentions like \"morning stretches for beginners\" and \"beginner pilates.\" Given the workout's low intensity and simple technique, it is clearly suitable for beginners. A secondary classification of \"Intermediate\" is included due to the potential for performing the stretches in a flow-style routine, which may add a layer of complexity manageable by slightly more experienced users. However, the primary focus is maintaining inclusivity for all fitness levels, especially beginners."
