  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a full-body pilates routine, which generally involves movements that require some coordination and body awareness. Pilates is known for its approach to body alignment and core engagement, typically aligning with intermediate level technique difficulty. However, given the peaceful and energizing description, comments about it being a calming workout, and no specific mention of complex movements, it's reasonable to also classify this as beginner-friendly for technique.",
