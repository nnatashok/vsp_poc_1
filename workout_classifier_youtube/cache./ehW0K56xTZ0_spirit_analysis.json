  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined.' The title and tags such as 'HIIT,' 'fat burn,' and 'interval training' clearly indicate a focus on high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which is known for its intense and fast-paced nature. The description mentions 'a tougher workout' with 'longer intervals' emphasizing pushing limits, supporting the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit with a score of 0.7, signifying a strong match.\n\nMoreover, the workout follows a clear structure: a warm-up, followed by timed intervals, and a cool-down, typical of disciplined and well-organized exercise routines. This is reinforced by phrases in the description like 'start with a 10-minute warm-up,' 'two full minutes,' and 'manage the pace,' which suggest a methodical approach. Consequently, this matches the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.8, indicating a very strong alignment.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits were not chosen due to the emphasis on challenging intensity rather than continuous and gentle movements."
