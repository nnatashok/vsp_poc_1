  "categoriesConfidence": 0.9,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category 'Breathing exercises' was selected with high confidence due to the repeated emphasis on pranayama, breathing exercises, and breathing techniques in the title, description, and tags. The video focuses on \"Pranayama, the art of breath control,\" with descriptions mentioning improving lung capacity and reducing stress (description, tags, comments). Therefore, this is clearly central to the video's content and purpose, justifying a high score (0.9).\n\nThe secondary category 'Yoga' was included with a moderate score (0.6) because pranayama is often categorized under yoga practices, as also suggested by the tags \"pranayama yoga\" and \"pranayama yoga for beginners.\" The inclusion of the term \"Yoga\" in both the title and channel content further supports this classification.\n\nOther potential categories, such as 'Meditation', were not selected because while the tags suggested related activities, the core focus remained on breathing techniques related to pranayama rather than meditation practices."
