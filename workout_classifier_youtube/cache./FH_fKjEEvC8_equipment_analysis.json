  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Prenatal Cardio Workout [FAT BURN] Safe, No Equipment' explicitly states in both the title and description that no equipment is needed for the workout. The tags, such as 'pregnancy safe fat burner' and 'prenatal cardio at home,' imply an at-home cardio routine. Furthermore, there is no mention of any specific equipment in the tags, description, comments, or other metadata. Therefore, based on all available information, this workout appears to be a bodyweight cardiovascular exercise session designed for prenatal participants, requiring no additional equipment."
