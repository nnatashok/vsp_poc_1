  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned to this workout video is 'Indoor biking,' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is strongly supported by the video's title, '15 Minute Workout - Best Indoor Cycling Training Cardio Session,' which explicitly mentions 'indoor cycling.' The description confirms this is a turbo trainer session, synonymous with indoor biking. Tags like 'indoor cycling,' 'turbo session,' and 'home trainer' further confirm this category. \n\nThe secondary  category 'HIIT' is considered with a moderate score of 0.6. The description of the workout using a 'pyramid structure' and 'different pedalling speeds' suggests high-intensity interval training principles. Additionally, the tags 'high intensity training' and 'HIIT' corroborate this classification. However, the emphasis on cycling makes indoor biking the dominant category, while HIIT elements are present but less explicitly foregrounded. The confidence level for all observations is supported by clear and explicit references in the metadata."
