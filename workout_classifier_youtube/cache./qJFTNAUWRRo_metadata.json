    "Hi!! I began Outpatient for depression and realized for the first time in my life I didn\u2019t actually unwind ever. I\u2019ve never lived in a calm brain. I began meditating every night before bed to practice mindfulness. Your meditations have played a part in my healing journey. Now I listen every day in my new routine. Thank you for posting these! They changed my life.",
