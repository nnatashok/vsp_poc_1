  "vibesExplanation": "The selected vibes for this workout are 'The Reboot Workout' and 'The Comfort Moves,' both of which align strongly with the metadata provided. The 'The Reboot Workout' vibe scores the highest at 0.9 due to the guiding emphasis on gentle stretching and muscle tension relief, as suggested by words in the description like 'gentle,' 'relieves muscle tension,' and 'body safe stretches.' The use of deep breathing exercises and the emphasis on relaxing further support this vibe, fitting the description of a low-stress, total-body refresh. The tags like 'relaxation' and 'deep breathing exercises' also reinforce this.\n\n'Comfort Moves' scores 0.8, supported by the video's accessibility for all fitness levels, especially beginners, and the tone of user comments expressing appreciation for the routine's accessibility and comfort, such as doing 'all the sitting down ones' and mentioning how 'relaxing' it is. This vibe is supported by the channel's focus on exercises that cater to beginners and individuals with specific needs, like those recovering from injuries, which enhances the comfort and safety notion.\n\nThe high confidence (0.85) stems from consistent indicators across tags, comments, and the channel's focus, eliminating ambiguity in classification."
