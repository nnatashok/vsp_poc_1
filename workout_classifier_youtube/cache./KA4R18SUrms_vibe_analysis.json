  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled \"KICKSTART YOUR FITNESS JOURNEY! 15-Min Beginner Interval Treadmill Follow Along!\" from IBX Running is primarily a beginner-friendly interval treadmill session. Several aspects of the metadata align with \"The Endorphin Wave\" vibe, including phrases like \"awesome beginner interval workout\" and \"let's get sweaty,\" which suggest an elevated energy, feel-good movement, and a steady build, supported by the playlist with upbeat music. This is reflected in the positive and communal comments from users who express a sense of achievement and a desire to return.\n\n\"The Meditative Grind\" also fits, given the repetitive nature of treadmill workouts and the structured interval design, allowing participants to 'zone in.' The emphasis on safety and staying within comfort zones suggests a controlled environment conducive to entering a meditative state.\n\n\"The Progression Quest\" is indicated by the channel's focus on improvement and building a fitness journey, supported by the beginner-oriented design of the workout encouraging incremental progress. Comments highlighting personal achievements, like reaching new speeds, reinforce this aspect.\n\nOverall, the evidence from the description, tags, and user comments provides a high-confidence assessment of these vibes."
