  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "as someone who struggles a lot with body image, which makes trying to be more healthy and fit really mentally/emotionally exhausting, i really appreciate that your videos aren\u2019t focused on achieving a certain body type but rather on the movements and how the exercises will make you feel. i love the variety and it\u2019s amazing that you\u2019re able to achieve a level of effectiveness that doesn\u2019t feel punishing or exhausting! thank you so much \ud83d\udc95",
    "I have been a Pilates teacher for over 20 years and have seen many teachers but you are most definitely the best! Your concise instruction, the tone of your voice, the pace, variety\u2026\u2026..everything\u2026\u2026.thank you for your inspiration!",
