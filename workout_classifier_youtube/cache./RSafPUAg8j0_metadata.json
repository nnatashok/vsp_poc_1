    "Last I saw him doing 7 min chest workout now it&#39;s 5 min a day will come when chris will give you a minute chest workout for sure!",
    "I like to use your workouts when i don&#39;t go to the gym,  it&#39;s very helpful as i&#39;m a hybrid between calisthenics and lifting",
    "Thanks, the 100 pushup routine really sculpted my chest. Would request you to make floor-only workouts without any equipments at all.",
    "Looking forward to increasing the size of my chest with the help of this workout.Thnx Chris \ud83d\ude0a",
    "I love your chest routine with the legend Larry Wheels himself - quick 6 minutes every day and I&#39;m seeing AMAZING results after a month. Thank you, Chris &lt;3"
