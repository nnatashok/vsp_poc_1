  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's title, '10 Minute Full Body Stretch & Mobility [DAILY ROUTINE],' and the description suggest a focus on stretching and mobility, commonly associated with a Soothing & Restorative spirit. This spirit is reinforced by the video's purpose to 'reduce any pain, tension, or soreness' and its suitability as a cool down, as mentioned in the description, as well as comments from users who experienced muscle relief. This highlights the session's emphasis on recovery and healing, justifying a strong score of 0.9 for Soothing & Restorative.\n\nAdditionally, the tags such as 'flexibility routine,' 'morning stretch,' and 'follow along stretch,' as well as comments mentioning the routine as a 'wake-up call for my body' and enhancing daily life, imply a Flow & Rhythm quality. These indicate a routine with a consistent, gentle flow, but not to the same extent as Soothing & Restorative, thus a moderate score of 0.5 is assigned for Flow & Rhythm. Other spirits like High-Energy & Intense and Sport & Agility are irrelevant given the video's focus on calm and recovery aspects."
