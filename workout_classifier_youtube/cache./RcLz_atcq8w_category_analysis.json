  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly categorized as a \"Cardio HIIT workout\" in both the title and the description. Several keywords and phrases such as \"HIIT,\" \"High intensity,\" \"interval training,\" \"fat burn,\" \"30s Work, 15s Rest,\" and \"intense\" in the tags, title, and description strongly indicate a High-Intensity Interval Training style, characterized by alternating periods of intense exercise and rest. The video's structure with short intense periods followed by brief rests (30 seconds of work followed by 15 seconds of rest) is a hallmark of HIIT workouts. Moreover, user comments reinforce this classification, discussing aspects of metabolic boosting and post-exercise calorie burning, common in HIIT workouts. No other workout types are suggested by the metadata, clearly placing it within the HIIT category with a very high confidence score of 1.0. Thus, no additional categories apply here."
