  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is strongly aligned with 'Flow & Rhythm' due to its emphasis on a 'Feel Good Flow,' as stated in the title and description, which highlights smooth and continuous movement patterns. The mention of 'heart opening sequences' and the integration of yoga and pilates suggest a coordinated approach. The high confidence score of 0.9 is based on the repeated references to yoga flow in the tags and the description, which suggest a music-driven, connected movement style. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also supported by the channel's background in dance, emphasizing coordinated movement. \n\nIn parallel, the workout embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, suggested by comments that mention the calming and energizing effect of the session and phrases like 'gentle calming low-impact workout.' The use of yoga for overcoming stress and promoting well-being, as seen in comments, supports a restorative focus. The score of 0.85 for 'Soothing & Restorative' is justified by both the metadata and users' feedback, which highlight a relaxation and comfort aspect of the workout. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded as the metadata and comments emphasize relaxation and flow over intensity or strict progression."
