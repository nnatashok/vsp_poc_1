  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is strongly classified as 'Pilates' with a score of 0.9, as the title 'Pilates for Better Sleep Workout' explicitly indicates this focus, and the extensive use of pilates-related tags such as 'pilates workout', 'pilates for beginners', and 'bedtime pilates workout' confirms its central role. The category 'Stretching' is also relevant with a score of 0.7, as the description highlights a balance of movement and stretching, aiming to relieve tension and prepare for sleep, aligning with the benefits typically sought through stretching. The channel specializes in Pilates, further strengthening the classification. The tags, comments on bedtime stretches, and description support these categories by emphasizing relaxation, winding down before bed, and body control, which are core components of both Pilates and stretching exercises."
