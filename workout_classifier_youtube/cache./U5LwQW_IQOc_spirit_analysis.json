  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified under 'Flow & Rhythm' with a high score of 0.8 due to the core Pilates workout nature, which emphasizes continuous, controlled movement sequences. The Pilates method typically integrates movement with breath and aims for fluidity, suggesting a strong mind-body connection and rhythmic quality, as indicated by the structured format of the workout and the emphasis on coordination seen in Pilates practice. \n\n'High-Energy & Intense' was considered but not chosen because the description and tags imply a moderate level of difficulty ('Moderate' in the title) rather than a focus on intensity or maximum effort.\n\nStructured & Disciplined' is also assigned with a score of 0.7 due to the structured, methodical approach of Pilates workouts which follow specific principles and body awareness, as evident in the metadata and channel focus on technical precision.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Sport & Agility' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded as there is no indication of sports-specific skills or outdoor/nature-based elements."
