  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for this workout video indicates a focus on resistance training with an emphasis on lifting weights. The title itself mentions 'Lifting Weights,' and the description elaborates on using resistance training to burn calories. This strongly suggests the use of weights, particularly dumbbells, as pivotal to the workout. The top comments also explicitly mention dumbbell exercises such as DB Bench Press, DB Row, and DB Shoulder Press. Furthermore, the practice of using lighter weights for more reps is emphasized, which is commonly applied with dumbbells. Therefore, the confidence level is very high (0.8) that dumbbells are essential for this workout."
