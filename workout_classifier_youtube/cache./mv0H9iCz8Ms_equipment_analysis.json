  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is focused on a 45-minute cycle training session, as indicated by the title '45 Minute Cycle Training Workout - Sprint Training' and reinforced by the description, which specifically mentions 'indoor cycle training' and 'sprint training session for turbo trainer or static bike'. The tags include 'Cycling', 'Bike', and 'Turbo session', further suggesting the use of a stationary cycling device. Comments from users also highlight the experience as comparable to spin classes, supported by the recurring positive mentions of Paul Ryman as a cycling instructor. This consistent focus on cycling and stationary bike equipment throughout the video's metadata justifies a very high confidence score of 1.0 for the need of an exercise bike, as it is explicitly central to performing the workout."
