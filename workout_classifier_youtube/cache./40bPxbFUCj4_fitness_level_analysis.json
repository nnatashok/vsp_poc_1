  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout focuses on restorative yoga, which typically involves simple, gentle yoga poses. The description highlights 'gentle and simple full body stretches,' and each pose is held for an extended period, indicating low complexity. Poses in restorative yoga primarily focus on stretching and relaxation, making them accessible to beginners. The suggestion of using supportive equipment (pillow or block) further accommodates beginners. An intermediate score is appropriate for those less familiar with yoga, as light guidance or hinting at posture refinement might be appreciated. Comments do not suggest any required technical proficiency beyond beginner level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 30-minute duration is tailored for relaxation, as suggested by 'stress relief,' 'calming,' and 'relaxation.' This involves low-energy poses with extended holds, which is typical in restorative yoga to enhance relaxation. The lack of active or intense movements keeps energy expenditure minimal. User comments and the promise of reducing stress further align with a low-effort requirement, emphasizing mental peace over physical exertion. There are no indicators of high intensity, fast tempo, or cardiovascular demand, consistent with a 'Light' classification for effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The beginner level is strongly supported due to the low technique and effort difficulties in restorative yoga, which involves simple poses with minimal physical exertion. However, for individuals unaccustomed to yoga, the extended duration and continuous mental engagement may present a slight challenge, warranting an intermediate-level consideration. The 'Advanced' rating, while not essential for the poses, recognizes that seasoned individuals, familiar with prolonged meditative states, may extract additional benefits from this practice. Feedback confirms the routine's effectiveness in stress alleviation without detailing significant physical or technical demands."
