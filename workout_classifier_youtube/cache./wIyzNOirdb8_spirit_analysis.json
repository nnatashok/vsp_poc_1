  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified with a primary spirit of 'Structured & Disciplined' (score: 0.8) due to its emphasis on planned, methodical exercises tailored for seniors. The description mentions 'step-by-step guidance' and 'proper form', indicating a structured approach to ensure safety and effectiveness, critical elements of this spirit. The channel's focus on improving balance, strength, and mobility through systematic exercises reinforces this classification. Additionally, the video has elements of 'Soothing & Restorative' (score: 0.7) because it's designed to be a 'quick and safe routine', with exercises performed seated, providing a gentle approach that aids in recovery and boosts health without stress, aligning with restorative qualities. The channel's dedication to comfort and suitability for seniors further supports this spirit. While 'Flow & Rhythm' might seem applicable due to continuous movement, the controlled, instruction-focused nature of the workout aligns less with fluid movement, leading to its exclusion. The high spirits confidence level (0.85) is due to clear, repeated indications in the metadata."
