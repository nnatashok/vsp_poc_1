  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video's title and description emphasize 'seated' and 'floor stretches', which strongly indicate the use of a yoga mat. The description mentions the practice as a 'gentle yoga practice' and the favorites section explicitly promotes a specific brand of yoga mat, reinforcing the relevance of having a mat. The channel's focus on yoga further suggests that a mat is central to the practice. The confidence score of 0.95 reflects the explicit reference to a 'Yoga Mat' in the description and the expectation that such practices typically require one."
