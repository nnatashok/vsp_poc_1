    "I have been working hard to get into shape and back into exercise after an injury. This video is perfect for me. It pushes me hard, but I feel safe and don\u2019t injure myself further. I get a great work out. I also find your reminders throughout the video to be perfectly timed (losing grip on bars, engaging core, push yourself if you\u2019re not etc.), and it\u2019s overall just my favourite workout video on the web! Thanks!",
    "I&#39;ve been doing this 10 minutes cycling from October of last year, along with some other exercises. What a big difference. I&#39;m  feeling so good. Thank you for sharing.",
    "That was an awesome cool down video thank you for making it \ud83d\ude00\u2764\ufe0f. Sometimes you don&#39;t want to think up the workout yourself you just want to follow instructions.",
    "This was a real beginner level. I tried others and I couldn&#39;t keep up. I was able to keep up with this. Thanks",
    "I just finished this workout and feel sweaty but good at the same time. I will be doing this gradually. Thanks for this video"
