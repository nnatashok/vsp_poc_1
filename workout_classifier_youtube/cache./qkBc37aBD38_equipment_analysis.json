  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title of the video \"20 Minute Pregnancy Strength Workout, With Dumbbells (+ Stretch)\" explicitly mentions the use of dumbbells, which indicates these are central to the workout. Additionally, the description further specifies, \"I used 2 10 lbs dumbbells,\" confirming the necessity of dumbbells for performing the primary exercises in the workout. The tags, such as \"pregnancy strength workout,\" and the emphasis on strength exercises imply that dumbbells are essential for adding resistance. Given this evidence, the confidence level that dumbbells are required is very high at 0.9."
