    "Just started 2024 with a new yoga practice as a beginner and I realised how rigid my body had become from years of weight training without keeping up stretching. I definitely thanked myself for starting the new year off right with yoga because all the tension in my body needs releasing \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f",
    "44th time watching this... I can touch my feet standing up for the st time in 27 years. <br><br>Thank you!",
    "It&#39;s about my fourth time doing this routine, I already see myself getting better and a bit more flexible, too. I also realised that now that I&#39;m familiar with the exercises I can take my glasses off and close my eyes and this has been one of the most relaxing experiences I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s still a bit difficult for me, but I can see progress, slowly but surely. Totally recommend.",
    "Literally changed my life, suffered back pain for years! two weeks after doing this routine daily i&#39;m pain free and feel ten years younger, thanks so much"
