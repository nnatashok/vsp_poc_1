  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily dance-oriented, involving basic dance moves synchronized to music. The title and tags indicate it is designed as a 'beginner dance workout,' suggesting simple, accessible movements. However, the presence of actual dance moves highlighted in a comment indicates some requirement for coordination, allowing for a slight inclusion of the intermediate level.",
