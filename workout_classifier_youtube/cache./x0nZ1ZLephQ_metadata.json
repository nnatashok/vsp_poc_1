    "Today is about slowing down. After you slow down, observe. What&#39;s going on?<br>What is it? Because whatever it is. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s all part of the process, baby.",

    "Exhale day 13\ud83c\udf89 the more I practice yoga, the more I learn it\u2019s not just the body that needs to work out or have rest days, but the mind as well. The more I meditate, the quicker I find peace, and stillness and calm my mind, these are tools that I\u2019ve started to use in day-to-day life, along with Adriene\u2019s voice popping into my head and reminding me to come back to my breath, they help to ground me and to take a few seconds before I carry on. Thank you, Adriene, for this practice my mind needed this rest, as did my body and for the reminders to come back to my breath. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
    "As I arrived on my mat this morning, I felt so drained, but as you handed me the fresh picked flowers \ud83d\udc90 I began to smile. I&#39;m at peace. I&#39;m balanced and ready to face my day ahead. Thanks very much  Adriene you&#39;re the best. Love \u2764\ufe0f always. Namaste \ud83d\ude4c \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\ude4f \ud83d\udc4b",
