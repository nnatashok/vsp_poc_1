  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Strong in 30! FULL BODY dumbbell workout to strengthen and sculpt!' mainly emits a vibe of 'The Progression Quest' (score: 0.7). This classification is based on the 'complete three workouts each week' recommendation, the ability to repeat the video for 4-8 weeks, and the emphasis on increasing challenge and muscle growth. This aligns with a structured, methodical approach to fitness improvement.\n\n'Vibe: The Masterclass Workout' receives a score of 0.6. The video focuses heavily on technique and form, as seen in exercises like sumo deadlifts, goblet squats, and bent arm lateral raises, suggesting a skill-building aspect, which is common in 'Masterclass' vibes.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Disciplined Grind' were considered due to the rigorous nature of strength workouts, but the specific focus on progression and skill refinement makes 'Progression Quest' and 'Masterclass Workout' more fitting. The emphasis on low impact and technique further reduces the possibility of explosive or adrenaline-centered vibes."
