  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is categorized as 'Beginner' due to the nature of breathwork exercises which are generally simple to perform. The tags and description emphasize breathwork and mindfulness, suggesting straightforward exercises akin to basic yoga breathing techniques. Intermediate level is considered due to possible nuances in breath control that may require some practice, as hinted by references to deeper states and personal growth.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Effort difficulty is rated as 'Light' based on the short duration (8 minutes) and the nature of breathwork, which typically involves low physical exertion. The video focuses on calming and mindfulness, emphasizing stress-relief rather than intense physical effort. There is a slight possibility of 'Moderate' effort during deeper sessions mentioned, but it's minimal due to the video's brief length and relaxation focus.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "For required fitness level, 'Beginner' is most suitable given the low technique and effort difficulty scores. The video's calming focus and short duration make it highly accessible for those new to exercise, as supported by tags like 'mindfulness' and 'beginnersyoga'. An 'Intermediate' level also applies due to potential breathing pattern complexities and self-awareness development, although these are not critical for participation."
