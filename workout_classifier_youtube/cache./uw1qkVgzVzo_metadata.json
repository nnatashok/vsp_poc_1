    "I love this new encore. I absolutely did not want to do it but I had to get to 45 minutes so I had to. And welcome little change.",
    "Every time I see you drop a towel I mean to come and tell you my solution to this, but I always forget after the ride is over.  On Amazon I found a roll of elastic with button holes all along it. I cut a decent length, sew a button on it, and thread it through the tag on the towel.  If the towel doesn\u2019t have a tag I just cut a small hole near the end seam.  Then I attach it to my bike before my ride.  The elastic allows the towel to comfortably reach your face but if you drop it the towel still stays connected to your bike.  Sadly the only thing I can\u2019t do is a towel \u2018cheers\u2019 at the end of the ride, but I\u2019m there in spirit. Lol",
