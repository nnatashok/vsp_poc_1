I also snuck in a bit of strengthening yoga poses in here to give you the boost of energy you need most in the early hours of the day.\n\nNo props necessary for this class but if you have a block at home you can always grab it to make some poses more accessible. This is a full body morning yoga stretch that will target all the aches and pains you may have accumulated during the night.
