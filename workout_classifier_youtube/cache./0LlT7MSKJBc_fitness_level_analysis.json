  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique and effort difficulties suggest a suitable range from beginners to advanced fitness levels. This HIIT workout accommodates beginners due to available modifications, but the intensity and coordination required for certain exercises mean intermediates and some advanced users will still find the session challenging. The absence of equipment requirements and the provision of easier variations help include beginners, although those very new to exercise may struggle with the intensity. High engagement from users and their feedback indicates it is accessible yet challenging, justifying a broad range of appropriate fitness levels."
