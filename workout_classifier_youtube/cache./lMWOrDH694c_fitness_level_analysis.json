  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video targets a broad audience with an emphasis on weight loss and alignment, suggesting straightforward yoga techniques suitable for beginners. However, it includes elements like 'tone and build lean muscle mass,' indicating exercises with intermediate technical complexity. The channel's focus is inclusive, with content catering to all levels, thereby suggesting possible adaptations suitable for beginners while incorporating moderately complex moves.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session's 36-minute duration, alongside keywords such as 'trim,' 'tone,' and 'strengthen' indicate a moderately intensive workout. Descriptions of 'burn fat' and 'workout your core' reinforce this assessment, aiming for a level that challenges users beyond very light activity. While challenging for less fit users, the presence of a 71 and 79-year-old engaged audience suggests manageability, therefore aligning with moderate effort and potential for challenge, mainly due to duration and implied energy expenditure throughout various poses.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.75,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is intermediate, given the moderate technique and effort difficulties influenced by duration (36 minutes) and the yoga moves. However, numerous comments from older participants demonstrate beginner-accessibility, which argues for its inclusion. Yet, intermediate is emphasized due to the energy demands and the potential for complexity in body alignment and movement precision over the longer session duration. Advanced is slightly acknowledged due to the potential for building skilled practice over repeated sessions."
