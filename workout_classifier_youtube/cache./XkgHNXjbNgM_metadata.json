  "description": "If you want to burn calories after eating food then today's video workout is for you!\n\nAs you know, our body's main source of energy is the food we eat. If you want to burn calories and lose fat you either need to eat less food, or exercise more in order to consume those calories you just got from eating.\n\nWhen you burn more calories than you eat, your body gets into a state called Caloric Deficit - this is when your muscles require energy to maintain a certain level of physical effort, but your body doesn't have this energy ready available. It then starts burning calories it deposited in terms of fat or the calories you get from digesting food.\n\nSo make sure you perform this workout after every meal. It contains simple, body-weight exercises that are not hard to do, and don't involve intensive moves - to avoid getting sick with the food in your stomach.\n\nLet's start the workout and be sure to subscribe to the channel to receive new video workouts everyday Monday to Friday.\n\nGood luck and leave me a comment below, tell me how you feel and how often you do this workout! \ud83d\udcaa\u2764\ufe0f",

    "I do this every after meal and do the 1 mile walk exercise afterwards. I also follow Chloe Ting&#39;s 2021 2 week shred in combination to this and it helped me loose weight. No extreme dieting, I just avoided junk and sugary foods. I eat veggies, fish, chicken, pork, brown rice but no coffee. I drink juice sometimes but only those with no added sugar like Ceres.",
