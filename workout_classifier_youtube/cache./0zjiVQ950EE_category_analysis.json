  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is \"Pilates\" with a high confidence and score of 0.9 due to explicit mentions throughout the video metadata, including the title '40 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT || At-Home Pilates', multiple mentions of Pilates in the tags (e.g., 'pilates workout full body', 'mat pilates', 'at-home pilates'), and in the description which highlights a 'Full Body Pilates Workout'. The channel's identity is heavily associated with Pilates, reinforcing this classification.\n\nThe secondary category is \"Mat\" with a score of 0.6. This is supported by the mention in the tags 'mat pilates' and 'at-home workout', and the description stating that this is an at-home class, implying exercises likely performed on an exercise mat without equipment. The term 'no equipment' in tags further suggests a mat workout."
