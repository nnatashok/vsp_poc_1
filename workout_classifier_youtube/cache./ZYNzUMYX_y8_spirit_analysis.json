  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video from Roberta's Gym titled '12 Min Bed Time Workout: Burn Fat All Night While You Sleep' is primarily classified with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This classification is supported by the video's focus on performing the workout before bed, aiming to promote metabolism and muscle recovery overnight. Phrases like 'burn fat all night while you sleep' and 'ensure consistent muscle recovery throughout the night' suggest a relaxing, recovery-focused intention. These characteristics align with a moderately strong match to the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, hence a score of 0.7.\n\nAdditionally, the workout has elements of the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The description mentions cardio and resistance training within a set routine, indicating methodical and planned activity. Comments from viewers detail consistent practices and noticeable results, further supporting this classification with a structured regimen implied. This is given a score of 0.6 for its importance in the workout's approach.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Flow & Rhythm' are excluded due to the workout's emphasis on pre-bedtime relaxation rather than high intensity or rhythmic movement."
