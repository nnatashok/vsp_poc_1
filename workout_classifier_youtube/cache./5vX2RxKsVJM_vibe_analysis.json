  "vibesExplanation": "The video prominently features elements consistent with 'The Warrior Workout' due to the sweat-dripping, heart-pounding nature of a full body cardio HIIT session, as suggested by phrases like 'extreme sweaty', 'intense' and 'burn up to 600 Calories'. The session includes intense exercise intervals common in HIIT, aligning with the primal, energetic vibe. The score of 0.75 reflects the strong but not absolute embodiment of this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, there are elements of 'The Endorphin Wave' as the workout promises a full-body burn with an elevated energy, encouraged by community engagement such as tracking personal progress over days and feeling stronger, indicating a steady build of endurance and feel-good energy. This warrants a score of 0.6 due to clear but secondary relevance.\n\nLastly, aspects of 'The Disciplined Grind' are present. The structured approach with set intervals of work and rest (45 sec on, 15 sec off) and comments about consistent practice reflect a disciplined, no-excuse mindset typical of this vibe. With moderate alignment, it secures a score of 0.5."
