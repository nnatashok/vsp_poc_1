  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises listed in the comments include beginner-friendly movements like planks and heel touches, which require minimal coordination and stability. Some exercises such as Russian twists and bicycle crunches require a bit more coordination and core engagement, pushing them to an intermediate level. Therefore, the scores reflect a blend of beginner and intermediate technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's intensity is indicated by the continuous nature of the exercises and the recommendation to only rest minimally. The exercises, done in rapid succession, with two rounds of circuits, suggest a moderate to challenging effort level for deconditioned users. The effort is high enough to cause sweating and a racing heartbeat, reflecting a moderate-to-challenging intensity.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulties, combined with the video's emphasis on modifying workouts to suit various fitness levels, it's suitable for beginners willing to push themselves. The workout's moderate-to-challenging effort and slightly complex movements make it apt for intermediate individuals as well. Advanced users can increase intensity, further aligned with comments about users seeing improvements over time. Thus, multiple fitness levels are applicable."
