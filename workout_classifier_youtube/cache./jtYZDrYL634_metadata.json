    "I\u2019m a 25 year old male that works 7 days a week currently. Finally requested a full day off, and I spent my morning doing stretches. Just basic stretching gave my body so much relief, especially in my back and legs. This routine fit perfectly with my stretches. I recommend this to anyone recovering from injury, and more importantly to anyone that deals with work related stress. This has given me so much peace in a short amount of time, and I feel very satisfied after doing something physical.",

    "This was my first time trying this and I absolutely love it.  I&#39;m looking forward to being consistent.  Thank you for all that you do and offer."
