  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'The Meditative Grind' due to its endurance-oriented focus with 'run and recovery intervals' over a substantial 40 minutes. This aligns with the steady, repetitive nature characteristic of this vibe. Terms like 'calorie shred' and 'endurance' in the title and description imply a long-duration challenge, supporting this classification, and the high confidence level of 0.8.\n\nSecondary vibe 'The Endorphin Wave' is identified based on user comments reflecting a feel-good, motivational experience, suggesting an 'elevated energy' throughout the session. This includes feedback about the workout being uplifting and the push provided by the host, contributing to a 0.6 score.\n\nFinally, 'The Progression Quest' is also relevant, noted from the channel's focus on running improvement and bettering oneself over time, as seen in the channel description. However, the direct emphasis on training progression in the video is less pronounced, resulting in a moderate score of 0.4. Overall, other vibes were excluded as they did not align well with the session's structure, music selection, or running-focused content."
