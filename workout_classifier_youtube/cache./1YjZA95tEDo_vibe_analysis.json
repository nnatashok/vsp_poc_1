  "vibesExplanation": "The workout aligns primarily with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe due to the focus on nervous system calming and relaxation goals described prominently in the video\u2019s description and supported by tags like 'relieve stress alleviate anxiety'. The chosen breathing method, 4-7-8, is explicitly designed to relax the sympathetic nervous system and is intended for anxiety relief and stress reduction, fitting well within the deepest relaxation and nervous system reset described in 'The Deep Recharge'. High confidence in this classification stems from the clear focus on calming the body's fight-or-flight response.\n\nThe secondary vibe, 'The Zen Flow,' is identified with slightly less scoring due to the similarities to slow-flow yoga and breath-centered practices indicated by the 'pranayama exercise' and 'mindful breathing meditation' tags. These contribute to a grounding and breath-centered experience, emphasizing intentional breathing without hurry. The calming commentary from a voice-over further enhances this vibe, aligning closely with grounding and intentional breathing aspects. However, as the primary goal focuses more on deep relaxation, the score is marginally lower than 'The Deep Recharge'.\n\nNo strong indicators for other vibes were present, as the emphasis was not on dynamic movement, strength, or competition."
