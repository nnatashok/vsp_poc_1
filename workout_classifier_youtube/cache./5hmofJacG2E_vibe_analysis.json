The emphasis on being 'easy on the knees' further supports this categorization.\n\nAdditionally, there is an element of 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe with a score of 0.4. The upbeat music (classic 60s hits) mentioned in the description, along with comments indicating enthusiasm ('felt great to feel my \u2764rate racing'), suggests an energetic yet sustained workout typical of this vibe, albeit more moderately than the primary vibe.\n\nThere is a moderate level of confidence (0.76) in this classification due to the clear indicators in the metadata, although elements of multiple vibes are present, necessitating educated mixing of these categories."
