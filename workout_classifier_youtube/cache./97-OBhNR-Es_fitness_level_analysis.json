  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video focuses on 'gentle Pilates' which typically involves basic exercise movements that require minimal coordination. Tags like 'gentle pilates for beginners' and 'pilates for everyone' suggest movements are not complex. Pilates may involve some level of body awareness, thus earning an intermediate inclusion, but the primary focus remains beginner-friendly, supported by the mention of relaxation and stress reduction rather than intense technical challenges.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as gentle with no equipment and no impact, suitable for deconditioned users looking for a light exercise. The 20-minute duration does suggest a moderate effort for completely inactive individuals, but the guided breathing and focus on relaxation significantly lower the intensity level. Viewer comments confirm its suitability as a light, relaxing workout.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The primary target of 'gentle Pilates' aligns with beginners as evidenced by references to exercises for stress relief and general accessibility ('for everyone'). The workout's duration and Pilates' core strengthening elements justify inclusion of intermediate and even advanced levels for those looking for gentle recovery or low-intensity workout options. Tags supporting multi-level accessibility suggest the workout can scale slightly for more experienced individuals seeking lighter activity, particularly due to its focus on breathing and body control."
