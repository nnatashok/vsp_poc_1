  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video description explicitly mentions that the instructor uses a set of 1kg weights, suggesting the use of dumbbells for the workout. This is reinforced by a top comment from the instructor herself reiterating the use of these weights for a few series of exercises, but also noting that the workout can be completed without them. Given these mentions, there is high confidence (0.6) that dumbbells are used, although they are not strictly necessary for the workout."
