    "This is an upgrade from original Wim Hof breathing. Not counting the breaths, but instead always 90 sec - starting with slow breathing and then gradually increase.. This is very good and important, because people have different pace, In Wim Hof exercises, people tend to keep the same rhythm as the recorded breather.. and that will not reach the same depths.. Thank you Kitaro  \ud83d\ude42",
    "I ugly cried by the second round, I think that just tells me how much I needed the space to let thoughts &amp; feelings that I&#39;ve been holding down, come to the surface.",
    "I practice with your videos most days and every time it improves my energy, focus and calm. Thank you, my friend, for your guidance.",
    "So great to see this. I use your other WHM video for most mornings - it&#39;s nice to have this more advanced one for sure. You are a great instructor and your work within the breath community is invaluable. Keep up the great work!",
    "I worked my way up from Wim Hof vids, to your basic vids, all the way up to this advanced which I have done for few months now. Very powerful. I use it in the mornings especially to slow my thinking down from the dream state. You always overdeliver Kitaro, so thank you my friend. Much love and Namaste, Dominic."
