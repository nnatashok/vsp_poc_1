  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Calisthenics' as indicated by the title 'Start Calisthenics with This Workout' and multiple tags like 'how to start calisthenics,' 'pull up,' 'push up,' 'muscle up,' and 'calisthenics.' The description mentions learning calisthenics moves such as the Handstand, Muscle Up, and Planche, further confirming this choice. A high score of 0.9 is justified due to the direct and repeated references to calisthenics across the metadata.\n\nThe secondary category 'Body weight' is appropriate because the workout involves exercises like pull-ups, push-ups, and dips, which are classic bodyweight exercises. The emphasis on home workouts and doing exercises at the park supports bodyweight training, earning a score of 0.7 as a noticeable element in the workout focus. Other categories such as 'Weight workout' or 'Indoor biking' are excluded as there is no mention of weights or cycling in the content."
