    "When I finished the workout I started crying at the end because I\u2019ve never been able to finish a HIIT workout to for more than 20 minutes. I feel like I can do anything now. It was so hard but by the end I felt myself wanting to do more. I\u2019m so proud of myself. I\u2019m going to beat obesity and I\u2019m going to get to a healthy weight no matter what.",
    "Thank God for ads. Never thought I&#39;d say that.",
    "To all the people doing this in their room without their parents knowing. You got this!",
    "This is my 3rd time doing this workout in a week and I am already seeing results, not just on my body but my stamina and endurance are significantly improved!"
