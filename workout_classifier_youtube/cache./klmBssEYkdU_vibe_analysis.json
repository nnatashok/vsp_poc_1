  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is characterized by a calming and intention-focused approach, as evidenced by the title '10-Minute Morning Yoga' and the description emphasizing clearing the mind, releasing tension, and starting the day positively. These elements strongly align with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, which is centered on grounding and breath-centered practices. The high confidence score of 0.9 reflects the strong alignment with the Zen Flow qualities of being grounding and intentional.\n\nAdditionally, the description highlights stretching out stiffness and energizing for the day, indicative of a refreshing and rejuvenating effect, which corresponds to 'The Reboot Workout' vibe. This vibe represents a total-body refresh and is supported by the positive comments from users expressing improvement in their well-being and appreciation for starting the day with this routine. The confidence score of 0.8 for this vibe reflects strong evidence of a replenishing experience although less than the exact Zen qualities.\n\nOther vibes such as 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Comfort Moves' were considered but excluded due to the emphasis on emotional energy and the feel-good nature of starting the day, which are better captured by 'The Reboot Workout' and 'The Zen Flow'."
