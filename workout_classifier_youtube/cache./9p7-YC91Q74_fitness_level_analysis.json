  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes exercises targeting various parts of the abdominal muscles, such as Scissors Leg Raise and Leg Raise to Hip Up, which require some coordination and body awareness, thus categorizing the technique difficulty at Intermediate. However, given it is a bodyweight workout without complex equipment and the exercises can be intuitively followed, there is also a Beginner aspect particularly for those who manage their intensity and body position carefully.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 10 minutes long, focusing entirely on the core with exercises performed in succession, likely providing a moderate to challenging effort level. The structure is typical of ab workouts that induce a burn due to continuous muscle engagement. However, users can rest or modify the pace, so it stays primarily at a Moderate level, with potential to be Challenging if done without breaks or high-intensity effort applied.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Derived mainly from the Intermediate Technique Difficulty and Moderate Effort Difficulty, the workout is suitable for both Beginner and Intermediate levels. Many user comments suggest repeat engagement and possible rest options, supporting Beginner inclusion. Yet, the sustained core focus also means it aligns well with Intermediate fitness levels typically able to handle targeted, repetitive muscle workouts. Advanced is included due to the potential for increased intensity when performed without any pauses."
