  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Guided Meditation to Reduce Anxiety - Relax and Calm Your Mind and Body' suggests that this session is focused on meditation rather than a physical workout that requires equipment. The description emphasizes meditation techniques, mindfulness, and stress relief but does not mention any physical exercises or equipment use. Comments and channel information indicate a focus on mental well-being and guidance through meditation practices. No references to mats or other traditional yoga or exercise equipment in the video metadata imply that this session is intended to be a bodyweight, equipment-free meditation session. Therefore, no equipment is required for this meditation, making it clear that it is a bodyweight-only session."
