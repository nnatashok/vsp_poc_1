  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified mainly under 'The Zen Flow' vibe due to its grounding and intentional approach aimed at quieting the mind and easing anxiety, as clearly highlighted in both the title ('Quiet the Busy Mind') and description ('calm the busy mind and sense of overwhelm'). Furthermore, the inclusion of breath practices and body scan techniques aligns with the mindfulness and breath-centered characteristics of Zen Flow. The 'Deep Recharge' vibe is also relevant here, since the video emphasizes reducing anxiety and stress through a body scan and relaxing focus, indicative of a nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement. This is supported by user comments mentioning relaxation and inner peace. Lastly, 'The Sleep Prep' vibe fits moderately due to the suggestion to pair this session with a sleep meditation for nighttime anxiety reduction, suggesting a preparatory role for rest. The explanation is sustained by consistent themes in the channel's description and the video's holistic focus on healing and mindfulness."
