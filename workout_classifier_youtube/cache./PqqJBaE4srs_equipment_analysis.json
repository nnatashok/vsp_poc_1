  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video clearly indicates that no equipment is required. Both the title and description emphasize a 'No Equipment' approach, with phrases like 'No Jumping/Apartment Friendly, No Equipment' and 'No equipment needed.' This is reinforced by the tags which repeatedly mention 'no equipment,' 'equipment free cardio,' and 'cardio no equipment.' Additionally, a top comment specifically appreciates the video for requiring no equipment. Though a mat is mentioned in the description as an item the creator uses, it does not imply that it is necessary for the workout, only as a personal preference. Therefore, this workout is designed to be bodyweight only, with no equipment needed."
