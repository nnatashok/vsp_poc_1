  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is an interval treadmill run, which involves basic to moderate running techniques, suitable for various levels depending on the speed and intensity chosen by the participant. Tags and descriptions suggest adaptability ('home workout', 'high intensity interval training'), aligning it with the 'Beginner' level with some modification potential and stronger alignment with 'Intermediate' due to coordination required for interval patterns.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as 'high intensity interval training' aimed at burning over 1000 calories, indicating significant energy expenditure. The duration slightly exceeds the 20-minute mark, making it more demanding but still manageable with self-regulated speed adjustments. The description emphasizes 'high intensity' and 'sprint', justifying the 'Challenging' level while being adjustable for different fitness levels.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is based on interval running, which can be adjusted in intensity to accommodate different fitness levels. The metadata, including the mention of Orange Theory (known for scalable HIIT workouts), implies flexible intensity options. Comments from viewers suggest impactful calorie burn potential, but variability in perceived exertion (e.g., emotionally challenging, significant weight loss, crying after sprints) indicates alignment across 'Beginner' (for those adjusting pace), 'Intermediate', and 'Advanced' levels."
