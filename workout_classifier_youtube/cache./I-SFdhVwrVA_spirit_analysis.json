  "spiritsExplanation": "The video 'Five Minute Mindful Breathing' clearly embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, with a perfect score of 1.0. The title, description, and tags such as 'Mindfulness', 'Mental Health', 'Mindful', 'Meditation', and 'Relaxation' all directly suggest a focus on calming the mind and body. The description emphasizes relaxation and focusing on the present, which are classic elements of a restorative practice. Comments further reinforce this, with viewers noting how the video helps them relax and manage their mental state ('this is the best no-BS meditation', 'helped so much', 'fastest 5 minutes of my life'). The channel also provides health and rehabilitation services, suggesting a therapeutic intent. There is a strong match with the Soothing & Restorative spirit, and no indicators for other spirits, resulting in high confidence in this classification."
