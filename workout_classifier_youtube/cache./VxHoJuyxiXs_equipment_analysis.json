  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a guided meditation, as indicated by the title \"Guided Meditation - Raising your vibration with the Angels,\" and the description explicitly states that it is a meditation aimed at raising vibration and connecting with Archangels. Meditation typically does not require any physical equipment, especially none of the types listed in our analysis options. The comments also reflect a focus on spiritual experiences and personal reflections, further confirming that this is a purely meditative practice. Therefore, this workout appears to be bodyweight only, with no equipment required."
