  "categoriesExplanation": "The video titled '15 Most Effective Bodyweight Leg Exercises' is classified primarily under 'Body weight' with a score of 0.9. The title, tags, and description heavily emphasize bodyweight leg training, and the exercises listed (e.g., squats, lunges) are typically performed using one\u2019s body weight for resistance. This matches the workout type described as bodyweight, making it the central aspect of the video.\n\nAdditionally, there is a score of 0.7 for 'Calisthenics' because the description explicitly mentions calisthenics as an exercise style related to the video content. Calisthenics often involves similar movements that focus on body control and strength without weights, aligning well with the exercises listed.\n\nA lower score of 0.4 is assigned to 'Mat', as the exercises are performed on the floor and often require a mat for comfort and stability, although this is not the primary focus. The 'Mat' category is included due to the format of exercises like the glute bridge and hamstring curl, which may involve a mat.\n\nThe content lacks mention of any gym equipment or additional weights, further confirming the appropriateness of these categories over others such as 'Weight workout.'"
