  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Mat' with a score of 0.9 due to explicit mentions in the title and description of 'Floor Exercises' and phrases like 'Bodyweight floor exercises,' which indicate a central theme of exercises done on a mat. 'Body weight' is another relevant category with a score of 0.7, as the workout involves a variety of exercises such as V sit pick up, frog pumps, and pushups, all utilizing the body's own resistance, as indicated by the phrase 'non-weight bearing routine' in the description. 'Stretching' receives a score of 0.4 due to the mention of exercises like 'side plank' and 'sun bathing knee tuck,' which suggest elements of flexibility and engaging different muscle groups. This category is less central but still relevant. Other categories such as 'Pilates' or 'Yoga' were considered but excluded because the workout doesn't explicitly align with their specific methodologies or focus."
