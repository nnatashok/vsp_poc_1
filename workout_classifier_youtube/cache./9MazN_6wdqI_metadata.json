    "Today was a really bad day and I cried for the first 5 minutes of practice, but with every breath it got easier and easier.  now I&#39;m calm, thank you very much",
    "During Savasana my dog dropped his ball directly on my forehead. I couldn&#39;t help but smile.. animals are SO pure. :)",
    "This is my very first time trying out yoga. I went in blind with no research about yoga and found myself crying all throughout the savasana. I didn&#39;t even know that yoga could do that and that I had all these tears locked up inside of me. I couldn&#39;t stop crying even after I had packed up all of my stuff. Thank you so much for guiding me in releasing all of the built up stress that I&#39;ve placed upon myself.",
    "Wow, I didn&#39;t realized that 30 mins has passed and I felt relaxed.",
    "Thanks!"
