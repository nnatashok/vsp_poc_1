  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary categories assigned to this workout video are 'HIIT' and 'Indoor biking,' both with very high confidence.\n\nThe 'HIIT' category is chosen due to multiple explicit mentions in the title and description. The workout is described as a 'HIIT cardio workout,' highlighting the high-intensity interval aspect. Furthermore, the mention of 'pyramids' and terms like 'fast, slow, fast structure' and 'increasing resistance' indicate a workout format characterized by intervals, consistent with HIIT principles. Hence, a score of 0.9 is appropriate due to the structure and intensity described.\n\n'Indoor Biking' is also a central element, as evidenced by explicit tags such as 'spinning,' 'spin class,' 'indoor cycling,' 'cycling workout,' and 'exercise bike.' The channel specialization in cycling further supports this categorization. The description emphasizes a cycling class format specifically designed for stationary or spin bikes, justifying a score of 0.9.\n\nThis video strongly aligns with both categories due to clearly defined workout structure and equipment focus, with no significant ambiguity or evidence supporting other categories like 'Weight workout' or 'Running.'"
