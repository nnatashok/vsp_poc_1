  "spiritsExplanation": "The classification of the workout primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' is largely derived from the metadata. The title explicitly states 'HIIT Express' and 'MAX EFFORT,' indicating a fast-paced and challenging session. The description reinforces this, emphasizing 'all out pyramid,' 'push your body to the max,' and 'burning big calories.' These elements strongly suggest a focus on high exertion and intensity, supporting a high score of 0.9 for 'High-Energy & Intense'. \n\nA secondary spirit of 'Structured & Disciplined' (score: 0.5) is evident in the detailed breakdown of intervals and rests, indicating a methodical approach to the workout, which is further categorized by specific time allocations for each sprint and rest interval. This structured training format justifies the score.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is considered at a lower confidence level (score: 0.4), suggested by the rhythmical pacing of interval sprints and rest periods. However, since the workout emphasizes maximum effort over smooth flow, this spirit is less dominant. \n\nOther spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative,' 'Sport & Agility,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to lack of relevant context or emphasis in the workout structure and description."
