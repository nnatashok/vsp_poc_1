  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is best categorized under 'Meditation' with a high confidence level of 0.95. The title of the video, 'Guided Meditation - Raising your vibration with the Angels,' explicitly states that it is a guided meditation session. The description further reinforces this by mentioning 'guided meditation,' 'raising your vibration,' and the involvement of 'Archangels' to 'activate your 12 chakras,' all of which are concepts typically associated with meditation practices. Additionally, the comments reflect a strong user association with meditation, mentioning personal meditation experiences and the video being a favorite guided meditation. The channel's description also supports a focus on meditations, healing, and intuitive guidance, strengthening the categorization. No evidence points towards other workout categories, thereby justifying the focus on 'Meditation' alone."
