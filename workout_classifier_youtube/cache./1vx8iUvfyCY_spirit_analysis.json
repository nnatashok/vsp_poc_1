  "spiritsExplanation": "The analysis of this workout's metadata strongly indicates the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The title, \"Guided Meditation for Detachment From Over-Thinking,\" directly suggests a focus on relaxation and mental calm. This is further supported by the description that highlights calming awareness, gentle detachment, and alleviation of anxiety-related symptoms. The tags emphasize relaxation, meditation for stress, and sleep, which align closely with restorative practices. Additionally, the channel description and user comments further reinforce this by highlighting experiences of relaxation, mindfulness, hypnosis, and overcoming anxiety. All these elements collectively point to a session designed to restore, heal, and relax the mind, achieving the highest possible match for the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. Other spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are irrelevant here as there is no indication of physical exercises, rhythmic movement, or structured technical training in the metadata."
