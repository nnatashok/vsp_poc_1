  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is primarily categorized as 'Indoor biking' based on the strong indications from the title, description, and comments. The title explicitly mentions 'Cycling | Biking To LOSE BELLY FAT,' which suggests a focus on biking as the core activity. The description also reinforces this with phrases like 'stationary bike or spin bike' and 'Biking to lose belly fat.' Additionally, the top comments confirm the use of stationary bikes as the key workout method, further supporting this classification. A score of 1 is assigned due to the very high confidence in this categorization.\n\nThe secondary category considered is 'HIIT' due to mentions of varying intensity levels in the description ('lower intensity, moderate intensity or even high intensity cardio session'), indicating that some elements of interval or high-intensity cycling might be discussed. However, without explicit mention of intervals or a structured HIIT format, the confidence for this category remains lower and is assigned a score of 0.5.\n\nOther categories like 'Mat,' 'Treadmill,' or 'Weight workout,' while mentioned in comments, are not relevant to the video's main focus on biking."
