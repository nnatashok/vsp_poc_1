  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is a '10 min Morning Yoga Stretch for Beginners' as stated in the title, clearly indicating a yoga session. The description further supports this with references to 'energy boosting morning yoga flow' and 'full body morning yoga stretch,' suggesting a predominant focus on yoga activities. The tags such as 'morning yoga for beginners,' 'yoga stretch,' 'vinyasa,' and 'sun salutation' reinforce this categorization by emphasizing different aspects of yoga practice. Given the channel's primary focus on yoga, with a substantial subscriber base interested in 'Vinyasa & Yin Yoga,' there is very high confidence (0.9) in categorizing this as a yoga workout.\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of phrases like 'full body stretch,' and 'yoga stretch' suggests a secondary focus on stretching exercises, leading to a stretching category assignment with a moderate confidence score (0.7). Although stretching is integral to yoga, it has been separately noted due to explicit mention of 'stretch' and 'full-body stretch' in multiple metadata elements."
