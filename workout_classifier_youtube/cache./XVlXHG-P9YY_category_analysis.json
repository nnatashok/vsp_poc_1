  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is 'Indoor biking' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is based on several explicit indicators in the metadata: the title includes 'Indoor Cycle Workout' which directly references an indoor cycling activity. The tags reinforce this, mentioning 'indoor cycling', 'spinning workout', and 'bike workout' multiple times, emphasizing the use of a stationary bike. The description further confirms this by inviting participants to use an 'indoor cycle or exercise bike', aligning entirely with indoor biking. User comments frequently mention using exercise bikes, reinforcing the video's focus on indoor cycling. Given these explicit and repeated indicators, 'Indoor biking' is the central defining characteristic of this workout video. Other categories such as 'HIIT' are tagged but not as prominently featured or emphasized in the video's content or user experiences to warrant inclusion."
