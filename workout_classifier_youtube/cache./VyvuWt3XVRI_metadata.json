However to get fat loss results I recommend the following:\n1. Being in calorie deficit\n2. Cardio/ HIIT workout (I often call these Fat Loss/Burn workouts on my channel)\n3. Resistance training and specific muscle targeted workouts. To strengthen and develop specific muscles.\nI have hundreds of other home workouts available on my channel, so you can pick and choose which workouts you want to do, to not only make you build a strong body, but also feel amazing.\nPlease remember every body is different and we all progress at different rates. The fact that you have shown up and completed this workout is incredible. You should be very proud of yourself for taking the steps to improve not only your physical, but also your mental health.\nThe key to achieving your fitness and health goals is consistency and healthy lifestyle changes, without restriction. I don\u2019t believe in crazy fad diets. Simply eat nutritious food, move your body, smile and enjoy the journey! Love Lilly",

    "I just want to say that as someone who has always hated exercise and exercise classes because of the environment and the way it makes me feel, i love the language used in this. Like &quot;if you&#39;re feeling extra strong today&quot; or just &quot;if you&#39;re able to do this, but if you&#39;re not here is an alternative&quot; makes it feel very welcoming!!",
    "To anyone who&#39;s reading this:<br>You are strong. You are beautiful. You are powerful. <br>Remind yourself that working out is not a punishment for what you ate, but a celebration of what your body can do!<br>I hope you have a fantastic day :))",
    "I&#39;ve done this for 2 weeks now every day, I only missed 2 days but I replaced the workout with 30 mins of cardio on those days. I started at 134lbs and I am now at 124lbs! I see a strong outline for my abs, as well as muscle definition in my arms. I also changed my diet to ZERO snacking + 3 healthy meals per day. It&#39;s hardwork but I see the results which makes me keep at it even more!! &quot;You never know if its going to work until you try.&quot; - the quote that changed my mindset.",
