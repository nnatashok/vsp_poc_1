  "vibesExplanation": "The workout predominantly aligns with 'The Groove Session' vibe, scoring 0.7, because it combines fun, expressive elements with a rhythm-driven approach, indicated by the inclusion of Taylor Swift music and the walking format. The video is intended to be engaging and enjoyable, as suggested by phrases like 'power walk through the next 10 mins with me.' The inclusion of popular music contributes to a lively, groove-centered experience.\n\nThe vibe 'The Nightclub Workout' scores 0.5 because of the music element, creating a rhythmic, enjoyable atmosphere similar to a dance party workout but tailored for walking. Terms like 'remixes by @KirstenAllenMusic' suggest a beat-driven experience, enhancing this vibe.\n\nLastly, 'The Meditative Grind' gets a 0.3 score since the workout's repetitive nature, with structured walking intervals, shares some elements with meditative, focused repetition, as seen in longer endurance workouts. Although less prominent, the structured pacing of the workout hints at this.\n\nThe classification is supported by metadata emphasis on music, enjoyment, and low-impact cardiovascular activity, emphasizing fun and steady movement."
