  "vibesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'The Comfort Moves' vibe due to its emphasis on being accessible for beginners and offering an easy, light workout that many people, including seniors, can perform. This is evident from the title '[Level 1] 10 Minute Bodyweight Workout for Starters' and the description noting it as a 'light workout session for beginners.' Comments also reinforce this, with users mentioning the workout's approachable nature and how it encourages continued participation.\n\nAdditionally, it somewhat fits the 'Reboot Workout' vibe, with a score of 0.7. This is due to the video offering a form of light exercise capable of serving as a refreshing warm-up or a low-stress activity, aligning with the idea of a total-body refresh. The low intensity and short duration make it suitable for this category, illustrated by the estimated calorie burn of 50-100 kcal.\n\nOther high-intensity vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' are excluded due to the workout's low intensity and focus on ease rather than intensity."
