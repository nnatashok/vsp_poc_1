  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.75,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is predominantly categorized as 'Beginner' because the workout is described as 'easy,' 'low impact,' and doable 'in bed.' These indicators point to simple movements. The lack of jumping and emphasis on being 'apartment friendly' further supports minimal coordination requirements. Although there's a slight possibility of intermediate-level movements due to potential modifications, the primary target and structure seem beginner-friendly.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated mainly as 'Light,' with evidence from the workout's short duration of 8.5 minutes and the description labeling it 'lazy girl' and 'low intensity.' This implies a low energy expenditure. The apartment-friendly and 'no jumping' tags further support minimal cardio demand. Some users may find elements of the workout moderately effortful, depending on their initial fitness, hence a moderate score was slightly considered.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level aligns closely with 'Beginner' due to the description emphasizing 'easy' and 'lazy girl workout.' It also accounts for viewers with minimal exercise experience. However, the inclusion of 'Intermediate' is justified by the possibility of users expressing some fitness advancements or engaging in variations to increase challenge. User comments support a supportive, inclusive atmosphere suitable for beginners but accommodating to marginally fitter participants."
