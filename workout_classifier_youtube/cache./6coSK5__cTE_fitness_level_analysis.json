  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily a cardio routine focused on burning belly fat without sophisticated or highly technical movements. The absence of equipment and the emphasis on bodyweight exercises suggest foundational movements that most individuals can follow, placing it primarily at a beginner level. However, a slight intermediate rating is included due to potential coordination and balance required during cardio sequences that may involve variable intensity or short bursts.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is over 20 minutes, and the description highlights sustained heart rate elevation, indicating moderate physical demand appropriate for less fit users. User comments reflect significant energy expenditure and positive weight-loss results, suggesting a challenging element for beginners. The perceived intensity from user feedback supports a challenging classification for users with low baseline fitness.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique difficulty is largely beginner, with some intermediate movements due to coordination challenges in certain cardio exercises. The effort difficulty, characterized as moderate to challenging, suggests the workout could be particularly demanding for very deconditioned users, fitting both beginner and intermediate fitness levels. Explicit claims of effectiveness and user endorsements of weight loss reinforce the accessibility for diverse fitness levels. The 20-minute duration nudges it towards requiring slightly more endurance than a pure beginner session, hence the inclusion of intermediate."
