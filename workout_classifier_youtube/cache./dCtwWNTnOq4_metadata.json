    "I turned 60 this year. Sadly, I have... let myself go. I am 50lbs  overweight, and my blood pressure is through the roof. I have been sedentary for the last year. I want to retake my life back. I don&#39;t like living this way. I hardly recognize myself in the mirror. I&#39;m going to do this. I believe your videos can help. Thank you.",
    "I do one of your workouts daily. It has been a great way to start my day and I find your warmth and personality make it so enjoyable. I would never have thought I could enjoy a workout, but here I am at 57 years old, getting fit and losing weight. 60 lbs down in 9 months, and maybe a little more to come. Thank you!",
    "Great workout thank you. I am 73 and just getting started after many years of sitting in an office and not much exercise.",
    "Your upper body work out really helps with my scoliosis",
    "I can not thankyou enough for these videos. I have been overweight most of my life, trying all sorts of food changes with no great success. While I have never loved exercise I have tried many different forms over the years but because it never shifted any weight I would give up as I also have had a lot of muscles and joint pain from a range of issues. Most of these issues, of course, stem from not loving myself but it has taken awhile to realise that. Anyway all of this is why I am so grateful for you and your videos, they are so filled with love and positivity, having different durations and body options means I can choose ones that fit how my body is feeling each day and really, for the first time in my life I actually get that post exercise buzz that people speak about. You are warm and kind and uplifting and have helped me find some joy in moving my body. Merry Christmas and much love \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\ude4f"
