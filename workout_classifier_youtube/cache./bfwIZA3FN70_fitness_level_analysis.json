  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises included in this routine, such as pelvic tilts, reaching thoracic rotation, and side-lying stretches, are relatively simple and require minimal coordination. These exercises are commonly used in pregnancy-friendly workout routines and are described as gentle and appropriate for all stages of pregnancy. The technique is designated as 'Beginner' due to their straightforward nature and limited need for complex body awareness, as evidenced by user comments expressing relief and ease of execution even for those with significant back pain. Although the channel targets users with various health levels, the specific exercises indicate a 'Beginner' focus. Intermediate technique score is given moderate alignment due to the potential need for body awareness during transitional poses, especially in individuals with severe discomfort.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated primarily as 'Light' since the workout is short (under 10 minutes) and consists mainly of stretching and mobility exercises, which are described as gentle. This makes it very low in terms of energy expenditure, suitable for beginners or those new to exercise, particularly pregnant users. The comments affirm that users feel relief rather than fatigue after completing the exercises, further supporting the 'Light' categorization. 'Moderate' effort difficulty receives a mild alignment because, for extremely deconditioned individuals or those in later stages of pregnancy, any movement may feel more challenging.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the technique and effort difficulty, the required fitness level is predominantly 'Beginner,' as the exercises are designed to be uncomplicated and low in energy demands, making them accessible to those new to exercise or experiencing discomfort. The video is aimed at pregnant individuals, who may naturally vary in fitness levels, but the ease of the exercises provides a very strong alignment with the 'Beginner' category. 'Intermediate' level receives some alignment due to potential flexibility differences and the need for any physical activity during pregnancy, requiring some foundational fitness. An 'Advanced' level is minimally aligned as the exercises are unlikely to challenge a seasoned exerciser."
