I know 5 minutes isn't a lot of time but trust me, you'll feel better by the end of it!\n\nWe'll begin standing up with a side bend sequence to energize your body before going into poses like ragdoll, temple pose, wide legged forward fold and  downward facing dog. A little bit of yoga is better than none, so let's get to it :) No props needed and suitable for all levels.\n\n\ud83d\ude0d MORE MORNING YOGA \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc49 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0v0k7UCVrkh5WZyHu0d0fWnaNgbmQTw\n\n\u2705 SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET  http://bit.ly/ywkassandra\n\ud83d\udd14 Don\u2019t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!\n\nThanks for watching,\nKassandra\nWEB \u27a1\ufe0f http://www.yogawithkassandra.com\nINSTAGRAM \u27a1\ufe0f https://instagram.com/yoga_with_kassandra\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 MY MOBILE APP \ud83d\udcf1 Stream or download more than 800+ classes, use the in-app calendar to track and schedule classes, new exclusive challenges, classes and programs added every month \u2764\ufe0f FREE TO DOWNLOAD \u2764\ufe0f http://bit.ly/ytmobileapp\n\n\nFREE YOGA CHALLENGES\n\ud83c\udf1e 30 day Morning Yoga Challenge http://bit.ly/morning30days\n\ud83c\udf1b 30 day Evening Yoga Challenge: http://bit.ly/bedtime30\n\ud83e\uddd8 7 day Yoga & Meditation Challenge: http://bit.ly/ywk7day\n\ud83e\udd38 30 day Flexible Body, Flexible Mind Challenge: https://bit.ly/flexbodymind\n\n\nMY PUBLISHED BOOKS & PRODUCTS\n\ud83c\udf3f \"Year of Yoga\" (NEW Book+ Online Program): https://geni.us/yearofyoga\n\ud83c\udfb4 \"I Radiate Joy\" Affirmation Card Deck: https://bit.ly/affirmationdeck\n\u270d\ufe0f \"My Yoga Journey\" Guided Yoga Journal: https://bit.ly/ywkyogajournal\n\ud83d\udcd5 \"Yin Yoga: Stretch the Mindful Way\" Book: http://geni.us/ywkbook\n\ud83c\udf81 \"My Yoga Journey\" GIFT SET journal, candle + book: https://geni.us/giftsetywk\n\n\n\ud83d\uded2 SHOP MY AMAZON FAVORITES \ud83d\udecd\ufe0f\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/yogawithkassandra\n\n\nSTUDY WITH ME\n\ud83c\udf93 30 hour Yin Yoga Teacher Training: https://bit.ly/yinyttkass\n\ud83c\udf93 10 hour Vinyasa Teaching Methodologies: https://bit.ly/yttvinyasa\n\ud83d\udd49\ufe0f 10 hour Yoga Philosophy Course: https://bit.ly/ywkyama\n\u26a1 10 hour Tantra Wisdom Goddesses Course: https://bit.ly/wisdomgoddess\n\n\nYoga with Kassandra - Disclaimer\nPlease consult with your physician before beginning any exercise program.
