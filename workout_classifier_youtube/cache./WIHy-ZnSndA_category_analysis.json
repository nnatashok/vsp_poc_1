  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Weight workout' with a score of 0.9. This categorization is supported by several indicators. The title '17 Min Strength Training Workout for Beginners' explicitly mentions 'strength training,' which is often associated with weights or resistance training. This is further corroborated by the tags 'strength training for beginners' and 'weight training for beginners,' and comments such as one mentioning 'actually finished a weights workout,' which strongly suggest the use of weights. The description includes links to strength training and muscle-building programs, aligning with the weight training focus. The channel's emphasis on home workouts involving dumbbells or no equipment suggests the workout could also involve body weight, but given the cues, weight training is more emphasized. Body weight received a score of 0.3 due to the mention of workouts with no equipment, though the context suggests weights are likely used more prominently."
