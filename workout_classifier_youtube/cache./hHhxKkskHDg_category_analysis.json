  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized primarily as 'Yoga' with a score of 1 based on explicit references in the title, description, tags, and channel information. The title includes 'Yoga,' and the description mentions a 'vinyasa flow full body yoga class' explicitly targeted at an intermediate level, which strongly indicates this category. The channel 'Yoga with Kassandra' specializes in yoga, further supporting this classification. \n\nThe 'Stretching' category is included with a score of 0.4 due to references to 'yoga for flexibility' and specific poses described in the video, such as 'forearm cat/cow' and 'reverse low lunge,' which inherently involve stretching as a component of the yoga routine. However, stretching is not the primary focus, as the main emphasis is on the yoga practice itself. \n\nOther potential categories, such as 'Meditation' or 'Breathing exercises,' are excluded because the focus is not specifically on mindfulness practices or controlled breathing techniques, despite comments about relaxation and calmness."
