  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is explicitly focused on the use of an elliptical machine, as evidenced by the title \"Beginner Elliptical Workout: STAMINA & STRENGTH | 20 Minutes\" and reinforced throughout the video description. The description outlines a workout that involves varying speeds and resistance levels on an elliptical machine, which confirms that this is central to the workout. Additionally, every tag is related to ellipticals, such as \"elliptical workout,\" \"elliptical exercise,\" and \"sunny elliptical machine.\" There are no mentions or implications of using other equipment in the video or the user comments, indicating a very high confidence that the elliptical is the sole equipment required."
