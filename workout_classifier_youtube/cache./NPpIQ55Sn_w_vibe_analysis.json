  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Comfort Moves' is assigned a score of 0.8, indicating a strong match. This is due to the emphasis in the metadata on providing exercises for those with knee or lower body issues, highlighting safety and accessibility with descriptors like 'low impact,' 'no jumping,' and 'easy weight loss workout.' These suggest a focus on comfort and gentle movement, making this vibe the most fitting. \n\n'The Foundation Builder' receives a score of 0.6 as the video focuses on basic body-weight exercises that address common problem areas and build fundamental strength without strain. The use of basic movements that emphasize form and technique further supports this classification. \n\nFinally, 'The Reboot Workout' vibe is considered with a score of 0.4, as the focus on low impact and home workouts without equipment suggests a mild rejuvenation aspect, although this is less directly emphasized. Other potential vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Meditative Grind' were excluded due to lack of emphasis on breath work or repetitive endurance."
