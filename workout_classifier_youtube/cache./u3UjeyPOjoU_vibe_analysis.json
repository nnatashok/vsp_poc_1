This supports the selection of 'The Zen Flow' as a primary vibe with high confidence (0.8) due to its breath-centered, grounding, and intentional nature. Comments mentioning calmness and a focus on controlled movements further reinforce this. 'The Masterclass Workout' scores 0.6 as the vibe is technique-driven, aligning with Pilates' focus on control and precise movements. The video is beginner-friendly, as indicated in the title, encouraging a learning experience typical of a masterclass format. 'The Groove Session' is marked with a score of 0.4 due to the outdoor, fun aspect highlighted by the description and comments, suggesting a fluid and enjoyable workout.
