  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a beginner stationary bike session with a focus on staying in the saddle, which aligns with minimal coordination and low complexity movements typical of beginner levels. The description explicitly states it's for beginners, suggesting straightforward pedaling techniques without complex variations. The only potential increase to intermediate is the optional challenges mentioned for those desiring extra effort, but these do not substantially increase the overall technique difficulty for the workout's intended audience.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 20 minutes is on the cusp for beginners, and typical indoor cycling can be adjusted for intensity. The tags, description, and comments reference it as a beginner's workout. The inclusion of segments like 'Rolling Hills' and 'Climbs' suggests moderate physical demand, but the overall structure remains light to moderate due to its short duration and beginner focus. Additionally, the options for speed and resistance increase could elevate the effort slightly, but the workout remains largely on the lighter side for most deconditioned users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the clear targeting of beginners in the description, title, and tags, this workout primarily aligns with the beginner fitness level. The comments confirm satisfaction from participants who view it as suitable for beginners. However, the mention of increased speed and resistance options provides moderate alignment with intermediate levels, offering some adaptability. The largely beginner-friendly focus ensures that both beginners and intermediates can find the session engaging and appropriately challenging, with a significant skew towards accommodating beginners."
