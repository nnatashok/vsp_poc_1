  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category, 'Stretching', was chosen because the video prominently focuses on increasing flexibility and includes terms like 'full body stretch', 'stretch routine', and 'flexibility'. These tags and the video's description emphasize stretching exercises focused on hamstrings, hips, and shoulders, making stretching a core component of the workout. A score of 0.8 reflects the clear emphasis on stretching.\n\nThe secondary category, 'Mat', is indicated by the video's description, which mentions performing the exercises on a mat, suggesting floor-based routines without any additional equipment. This aligns with mat exercises, which often incorporate bodyweight movements for stretching and light strength work. The presence of 'dynamic moves' and 'gentle holds' within a mat setting supports this category, justifying a score of 0.6.\n\nOther potential categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Pilates' were not chosen due to lack of specific indicators or references to those practices. The channel\u2019s focus on a mix of fitness categories provides additional context but does not explicitly point to other specific types beyond stretching and mat work."
