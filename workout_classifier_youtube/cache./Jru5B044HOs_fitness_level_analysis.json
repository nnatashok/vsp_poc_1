  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is based on the 'Scientific 7 Minute Workout', which is a well-known, beginner-friendly routine comprising fundamental bodyweight exercises like jumping jacks, wall sits, pushups, and step-ups. These exercises predominantly require basic movement skills and coordination, indicative of a beginner level. The suggestion from comments and Fitness Blender's inclusive approach reinforce this perception. However, the potential modification options and varied skill levels attending imply some exercises could challenge lower-end intermediates, like more controlled versions of basic exercises.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the 9:30 minute duration and the foundational nature of the movements, the workout is designed to be quick and accessible. The high intensity mentioned in 'HIIT' implies potential for moderate exertion, but the short duration and at-home context suggest it's primarily light effort. User comments about scalability imply adjustments for increased effort, hence, lighter seekers may adjust to a minimal moderate effort, especially with intensity variation.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout's beginner technique and light effort make it accessible to fitness novices. However, user-generated commentary reveals it supports scalability through progression, affecting multiple fitness levels, including higher beginners or developing intermediates exploring improvements. Advanced users are less typical but can engage by completing multiple workout rounds back-to-back, as mentioned in user experiences, thus achieving an intensified session."
