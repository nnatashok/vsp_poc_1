  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled \"12 MIN PILATES CORE WORKOUT | RA PILATES\" primarily embodies the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit. This is evidenced by the use of Pilates, a practice known for its smooth, continuous movements and emphasis on coordination and alignment, matching the criteria for this spirit. Additionally, the repeated encouragement to 'follow along' supports the flow element of continuously guided exercise. The score of 0.7 reflects strong indicators of this spirit, though it doesn't mention music-driven pacing, which could have increased the score.\n\nThe workout also aligns with the \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit. The description highlights it as an \"Intermediate level\" workout, suggesting a degree of progression and adherence to specific technical protocols typical of a structured approach. Pilates generally involves precise, controlled movements which contribute to this spirit. The reference to 'program' in the tags and the detailed, structured offerings of the RA Pilates app support this classification. The score of 0.6 reflects a clear, but not dominant association with this spirit.\n\nOther spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Soothing & Restorative\" were not selected as the workout lacks explicit indicators of high intensity or a focus on relaxation and recovery."
