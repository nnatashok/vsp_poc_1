    "To be honest I feel a little bit ashamed of myself for finding this workout hard after reading the comments but I know I got myself into a very bad deep hole after getting diagnosed with my thyroid diseases and gaining a lot of weight surely did noting good but here I am trying to get myself together I hope in the future It will be an easier beginner workout for me too until than I am going to practice and fight. Have a good day today and tomorrow everyone \ud83e\udd70",
    "Taking it back to basics today with this 35 minute Beginner Pilates class. If you are new to pilates or just want to slow things down, this class is for you.\ud83d\ude0a Let me know how you go and if you would like to see more beginner classes. \ud83d\udc95",
    "This was my first pilates workout, i usually did hiit&#39;s and weight workouts, after which felt like I was doing these workouts not because I want to be healthy, but because I am chasing beauty standards, it is very tiring and I decided to change my routine to stay active but with less intensity, and as it turned out, I really liked Pilates! I really liked how you explained each step and taught how to breathe, because I often forget about breathing, I felt many muscles and for the first time in a long time I feel more positive and cheerful than tired with just the desire to lie down, thank you very much for your work.",
    "I loved doing the moves more mindfully instead of rushing through to sweat it out. Thank you!!",
    "Thank you for going slow and using a soothing voice. I\u2019m 75 and this is a first Pilates experience for me. Looking forward to being a better me \u2764"
