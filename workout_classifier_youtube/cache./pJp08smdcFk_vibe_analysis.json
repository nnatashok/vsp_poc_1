  "vibesExplanation": "\"The Foundation Builder\" vibe was chosen due to the focus on strengthening core stability and addressing back pain, which is emphasized by the description's mention of specific exercises targeting foundational muscle groups such as abs, obliques, lower back, and hips. This aligns with a corrective exercise approach, typically involved in foundation building (score: 0.75). \"The Comfort Moves\" vibe was selected based on the video's appeal to a broad audience, including beginners, and its gentle, equipment-free nature. The exercises, such as 'singular leg bridge' and 'planks', aim to increase core strength while reducing pain, highlighting a focus on comfort and ease for those with physical limitations, inferred from comments regarding existing back pain and arthritis (score: 0.6). There was moderate confidence in these vibes due to the alignment of exercise type and audience with typical indicators of these vibes, and the expert guidance offered by a physical therapist further reinforces this confidence."
