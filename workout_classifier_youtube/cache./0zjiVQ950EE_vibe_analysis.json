  "vibesExplanation": "The primary workout vibe for this Pilates workout is 'The Groove Session' (score: 0.7). The metadata points to a flowing, expressive movement style typical of Pilates, which can be seen in the description's promise of leaving the participant 'feeling stronger, energised and with a post-workout glow'. The music selection, featuring mellow and flowing tracks like 'Merry Bay' and 'Warm Nights', further supports a groove-oriented vibe. Additionally, the empathetic and supportive comments echo this fun and fluid vibe.\n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Zen Flow' (score: 0.65), driven by the grounding and intentional qualities of Pilates. The instructor's background as a yoga instructor and the channel's focus on movement that 'feels good for your body and soul' suggest a grounding, breath-centered approach. This aligns with the calming effect readers mention from the instructor's voice and pacing.\n\nAlternative vibes like 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' and 'The Reboot Workout' were considered due to the rhythmic beat-driven music and total-body focus, but lacked strong overt indicators."
