  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category is 'Breathing exercises' with a high score of 0.9, based on the explicit focus on breathwork throughout the title, description, and tags (e.g., 'breathwork,' 'activating breathwork routine,' and 'Wim Hof'). The video's structure, including rounds and a guided session, aligns with structured breathing routines aimed at physiological and emotional effects, as described by the creator's intent to help 'release emotional blockages' and the comments about transformative emotional experiences and sensations.\n\n'Meditation' is included with a score of 0.6 due to the video's aim to bring about relaxation and clarity, evidenced by tags like 'meditation,' 'mindfulness,' and 'mentalhealth,' as well as the description and channel's focus on mindfulness and personal growth. Additionally, there is an explicit mention of meditation in the timestamps, suggesting it is part of the session.\n\nOther categories, such as 'Yoga' or 'Stretching,' were excluded due to lack of relevant physical movement indicators."
