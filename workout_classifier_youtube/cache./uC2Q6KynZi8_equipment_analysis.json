  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"20 min Beginner Flow for Strength & Flexibility\" by Yoga with Kassandra explicitly states in the description that \"No props required.\" This aligns with typical beginner yoga classes that often focus on foundational strength and flexibility using only bodyweight exercises. The tags further emphasize that this is a beginner yoga class, which typically doesn't require any equipment. Although a mat is commonly used in yoga for comfort and safety, it is not explicitly mentioned as required in the metadata provided. Therefore, this workout is classified as bodyweight only, requiring no additional equipment."
