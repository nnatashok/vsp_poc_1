  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercise involves a specific breathing pattern (4s inhale, 16s hold, 8s exhale) that is simple and does not require complex movement or coordination typically associated with traditional exercises. This indicates a Beginner level of technique difficulty. However, given the precision required in timing breaths, holding and releasing them, it requires a slight degree of awareness and coordination, justifying a mild crossover into Intermediate territory, although minimally. This pattern could be new to those unfamiliar with breathwork.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The exercise is a breathing technique aimed at promoting lymph flow and does not require physical exertion in the form of traditional movement or cardiovascular activity. The lack of physical activity and presence of deep breathing suggests very low energy expenditure, which is typical for 'Light' effort difficulty. Furthermore, the duration of 19:26 minutes is within a range that might present some challenge in maintaining focus, but the activity itself remains low effort as it requires stillness and breath focus only.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique difficulty is largely Beginner and the effort difficulty is Light, the workout is highly suitable for Beginner fitness levels. The breathing pattern's moderate complexity when incorporating specific timings might initially challenge those completely new to breathwork, slightly extending into the Intermediate fitness level. However, since the technical demands are low and the effort is minimal, it remains broadly accessible, making it highly appropriate for beginners as well as slightly more experienced individuals looking to improve or explore breathwork."
