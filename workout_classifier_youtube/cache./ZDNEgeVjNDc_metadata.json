    "Finally, Thank you for not talking in some weird cadence and not quite a talk or whisper with weird annunciation.  ThAnk You.",
    "What do you do when you wake up at 4:33 am and want to sleep longer? You come here and put this video on! Worked like a charm! Thanks! Zzzzzzed restfully! Time for coffee!",
    "I have tried many different yoga nidras and yours is the only one that works everytime.  Thank you!",
    "I have done yr yoga nidra for years...also passed it on to others. Thank you",
    "I love your no nonsense video&#39;s.  Ive tried other Yoga Nidra videos but they ramble on. I like that you speak softy, but normally.  Your content is clear. If im still awake when your video has finished, i start again. <br>If i go to bed with a busy mind, i pop your one of your video&#39;s again. <br>Thank you so much Lizzy Hill. You are a god send."
