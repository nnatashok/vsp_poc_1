  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'HIIT Workout - High Intensity Intervals | GCN 25 Minute Bike Session' clearly suggests the use of an exercise bike, as indicated by keywords like 'Bike Session' and 'indoor cycling training session'. The description explicitly states that the session is 'ideal for an indoor bike or for your turbo trainer', and tags such as 'spin bike', 'cycling training', and 'wattbike' further support this. Additionally, user comments mention aspects of cycling such as RPM, which is specific to cycling workouts, reinforcing that an exercise bike is central to the workout. Given this explicit mention in multiple sections of the metadata, the confidence level is very high (0.9) that an exercise bike is required for this workout."
