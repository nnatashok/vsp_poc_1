  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video features yoga moves targeted at runners, which are typically accessible to those with basic coordination and balance. The description emphasizes that the practice 'stays low to the ground,' suggesting straightforward postures. Tags like 'yoga stretching' and 'restorative yoga' also indicate simplicity. With statements like 'Find What Feels Good,' the intention is to keep the practice open and adaptable, suggesting low complexity. However, since yoga can vary in difficulty slightly based on execution, I also included intermediate due to the 'yoga for strength' tag.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's 30-minute duration suggests a light to moderate effort. Yoga typically does not have high energy expenditure but can still be challenging in terms of flexibility and endurance. The description's focus on 'stretch and soothe' and 'balance and restore' reflects lower physical demands, aligning with 'post workout' and 'restorative yoga' tags. However, the duration slightly elevates the effort above a purely light level, justifying a moderate score too.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Combining beginner technique difficulty with light to moderate effort results in requiring a fitness level appropriate for both beginners and those with slightly more experience. The 'all levels' mention in the channel's general philosophy and the yoga genre's adaptable nature justify including both beginner and intermediate levels. The sequence is designed to be restorative and accessible, as indicated by the tags and description, which cater to various fitness levels."
