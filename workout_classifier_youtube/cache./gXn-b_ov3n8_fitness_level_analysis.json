The description mentions that the class can be suited for all levels with modifications, which suggests that the technique is adaptable and not overly complex. However, Pilates requires some degree of coordination and control over body movements, which justifies a stronger score for beginner and some score for intermediate technique difficulty.",

The scalable nature of Pilates also allows room for repeated practice, making it appropriate for beginner to intermediate levels, with some possibility for advanced due to faster pacing mentioned."
