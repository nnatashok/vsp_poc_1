  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '[Level 1] 10 Minute Bodyweight Workout for Starters' and associated metadata indicate that no specific equipment is required. The title and tags repeatedly emphasize 'bodyweight' and 'no gym required,' highlighting that this is a workout designed to be performed without additional equipment. Comments further reinforce that the workout is accessible for beginners, suggesting exercises that rely on bodyweight alone. Consequently, it appears designed to be performed with just the participant's body, making it a suitable bodyweight-only routine."
