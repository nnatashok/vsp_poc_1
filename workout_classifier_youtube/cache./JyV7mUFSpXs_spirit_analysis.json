  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit identified for this video is 'Structured & Disciplined' with high confidence and a score of 0.9. Evidence for this classification includes the detailed breakdown of exercises with specific timing provided in the description (e.g., \"00:40 Double Bicep Curl,\" \"01:30 Wrist x Hammer Curl\"), indicating a methodical and regimented approach. The emphasis on a 10-minute routine that can be repeated weekly suggests a planned, progressive training regimen. \n\nThe secondary spirit is 'High-Energy & Intense' with moderate confidence and a score of 0.4. This is inferred from the tags such as \"big biceps workout\" and user comments describing visible results and personal fitness transformations. However, the focus on 'lightweight dumbbells' reduces the intensity compared to heavier, more strenuous sessions. \n\nOther spirits, like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative', were excluded due to lack of evidence in smooth movements, mind-body connection, or relaxation focus. Overall, the video leans more towards disciplined muscle-building rather than purely high-energy experience."
