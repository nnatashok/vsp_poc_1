    "Remember that feeling you&#39;d get when your whole life was ahead of you? As you listen to this hold that feeling. Then know that you are still young no matter how old you are and that your inner being will always be young as it continues on, into life after life. Knowing this will aid you to manifest on as this life&#39;s inevitable challenges and sorrows try and beak your spirit. All is well. Be well. All conditions are temporary. Nothing matters.",
