  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Comfort Moves' was chosen as the primary vibe due to the video\u2019s focus on exercises that can be performed in bed, which aligns with the descriptions of safe, cozy, and feel-good movements. The metadata emphasizes ease ('easy exercises'), comfort ('do not want to get out of bed'), and accessibility for those with mobility issues ('if you cannot leave your bed'), supporting a strong match with a score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Reboot Workout' vibe was selected due to the emphasis on refreshing and low-impact exercise, as indicated by the terms 'easy' and 'burn fat along the way'. It represents a lower level of intensity, suited for recovery and gentle engagement, earning a score of 0.6.\n\nLastly, 'The Mindful Walk' was considered, though less relevant, due to the aspect of being in a mentally relaxed space ('can exercise in bed'), which suggests a meditative aspect to the physical activity. However, this vibe's connection is weaker, so it receives a score of 0.4. Other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush' were excluded due to the explicit promotion of ease and comfort over intensity."
