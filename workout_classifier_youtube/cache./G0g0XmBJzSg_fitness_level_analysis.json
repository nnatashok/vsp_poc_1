  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is tagged and described extensively as 'for beginners,' and mentions 'easier variations for each exercise,' indicating that the technique is intentionally simplified. It involves 'calisthenics', which often includes movements like push-ups or bodyweight squats, typically beginner-friendly. The presence of any intermediate techniques is suggested by the offering of simpler alternatives, allowing for a small portion of intermediate-level challenge, especially when considering those improving from a very low base fitness level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of approximately 17 minutes is relatively short, which is aligned with a light to moderate effort level. Mention of 'two rounds of 6 exercises' implies a somewhat low intensity and the focus on beginner accessibility reinforces that it may not be overly physically demanding. However, given it's a full-body workout, the intensity could miniaturally increase to moderate for highly deconditioned individuals or those unaccustomed to active movements, thus the moderate score.",

    }
  ],
  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the emphasis on the workout being for 'beginners' and the inclusion of 'easier variations', this session is decisively beginner friendly. However, the combination of a full-body regimen in a relatively short timespan, which could be moderately intense for some complete beginners, allows it to also slightly challenge those at the lower intermediate level who could require refinement on their technique or endurance to keep pace. Therefore, a minor intermediate score is justified."
