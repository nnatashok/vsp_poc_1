  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video's description explicitly states, \"This is a full body workout and there is no equipment needed!\", indicating that the workout is designed to be performed using body weight only. Additionally, the nature of the workout, being low intensity and low impact aimed at relieving period-related tension, implies that it is gentle and could include stretching exercises typically done without added equipment. Although a mat is mentioned in the description related to a specific product promo, it is not indicated as necessary for the workout, but rather as an option. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, with no equipment required."
