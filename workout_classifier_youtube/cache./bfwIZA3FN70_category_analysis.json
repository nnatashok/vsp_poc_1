  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Stretching,' with a score of 0.8. The video focuses on relieving lower back pain with a series of stretches specifically designed for pregnant women, as evidenced by the clear mention of 'lower back pain relief exercises,' 'back stretches,' and detailed stretch exercises like 'Pelvic tilts' and 'Kneeling side lower back stretches' in the description and tags. This suggests a strong presence of stretching as the central theme of the workout, supported by user comments praising the pain relief effects. The secondary category 'Mat' receives a score of 0.6, indicating a moderate presence. The exercises are performed on the mat without any equipment, as implied by descriptions of activities 'performed kneeling on all fours and in side lying,' indicating mat exercises. Other potential categories like Yoga or Pilates were excluded because there is no specific evidence of mind-body integration typical of yoga or the controlled strength exercises characteristic of pilates."
