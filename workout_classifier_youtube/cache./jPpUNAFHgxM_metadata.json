  "title": "Alan Watts - Guided Meditation (Awakening The Mind)",
  "description": "Another video, in a series of more to come, that I believe really provides relief from perspective. Here is Alan Watts, a name which needs no introduction, sharing his method of obtaining self awareness. I then enhanced the audio quality, and paired it with a song that I felt was suitable and would sync nicely with his words.\n\nWe are all looking for a way to find our answers, which is why this video was made, and you are here watching it. All the best...IB\n\nThanks to dreamscene.org for the animation.",

    "Thank you Dvayers for sharing...I was beginning to think I&#39;m hearing things, haha. This is all the video is...meant to listen, and learn to listen better, until you hear what it is you&#39;ve been listening for. / The song you hear actually has a lot of versions, the one I&#39;m using is called &quot;Sei He Ki&quot;. YouTube user &quot;TheSuperZenSpot&quot; has this exact version on their channel. All the best...IB",
    "I&#39;m very grateful to live in a time where I can listen to this from anyplace in the world.",
    "Loud advertisements during a YouTube ASMR or Meditation video say more about modernity than I ever could.",
    "I&#39;m a therapist and I share this with my clients. Rest Easy, Alan. Your legacy will live on.",
    "I&#39;m glad that even now, coming up on 50 years after his death, technology has allowed Alan Watts to be the spiritual and mental health advisor that I never knew I needed."
