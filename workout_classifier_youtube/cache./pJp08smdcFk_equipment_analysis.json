  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "This workout video is designed as a 'Just 6 Minutes A Day' core strengthening routine without any required equipment, as stated explicitly in the description: 'there is zero equipment required.' The focus is on a sequence of bodyweight exercises such as brace marches, reverse crunches, heel touches, and various types of planks and holds, which typically do not need any additional equipment. Although the description includes a link to an exercise mat, it suggests it as an optional purchase rather than a necessity, aligning with the fact many of these exercises would traditionally benefit from a mat for comfort and safety. However, since the workout is described as 'zero equipment required,' no equipment is classified as mandatory."
