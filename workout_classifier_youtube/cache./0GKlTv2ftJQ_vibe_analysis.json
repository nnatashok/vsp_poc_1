  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is \"The Meditative Grind\" with a score of 0.7 due to the interval structure and repetitive nature of treadmill walking, which promotes zoning in on the task. The consistent use of manual treadmills and the explicit focus on interval training suggest a steady rhythm that aligns with this vibe. The inclusion of simple resistance adjustments and form tips from the trainer further emphasizes a methodical and focused approach.\n\n\"The Reboot Workout\" was considered due to the beginner-friendly and low-stress nature of manual treadmill walking. The workout is accessible and gentle, offering a refreshing introduction to interval training for beginners, which can be reinvigorating.\n\n\"The Endorphin Wave\" scored a 0.4 as the intervals provide a steady build in intensity leading to increased energy and the release of endorphins. User comments about feeling the burn and sweating suggest the workout offers a mild endorphin kick.\n\nOther potential vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" were excluded due to the beginner-level nature and lower intensity than typical for that category."
