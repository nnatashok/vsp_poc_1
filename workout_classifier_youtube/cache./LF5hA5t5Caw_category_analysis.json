  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is clearly categorized as an 'Indoor biking' workout, as it prominently features indoor cycling on stationary equipment. This is evident from the title which mentions '60 minute 3 hills Indoor Cycling Workout', and the description which highlights it as a 'Virtual Cycling 3 Hill Workout'. The tags include numerous references to cycling-related terms such as 'Indoor Cycling', 'Bike', 'Cycling', and 'Turbo Trainer'. Additionally, the channel itself, named 'Indoor Cycling Videos', explicitly focuses on indoor cycling workouts, further reinforcing this category. Given the strong and repeated emphasis on indoor cycling throughout the metadata, a high score of 0.95 is assigned to this category. No significant evidence supports the inclusion of other workout categories, making 'Indoor biking' the sole, highly confident classification."
