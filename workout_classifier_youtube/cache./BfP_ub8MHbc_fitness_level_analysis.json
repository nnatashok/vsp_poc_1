  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is classified under 'Beginner' for Technique Difficulty due to the title and description emphasizing that it is a 'quick & easy' full-body yoga practice. The video's appeal as a daily, simple routine suggests straightforward movements, requiring minimal coordination or complexity. The description's advice to modify postures also implies accessibility for beginners. Some intermediate techniques might be involved due to the term 'full body' yoga, which could incorporate a slightly broader range of basic poses, warranting a minor score at the Intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The short duration of the video (just over 6 minutes) indicates a low intensity, aligning with the 'Light' effort level. The terms such as 'quick,' 'easy,' and 'short' suggest low energy expenditure, consistent with beginner-friendly practices. However, as it is a full-body session, slightly more exertion could be required, meriting a small score at the 'Moderate' level for some deconditioned users. Viewer comments indicate ease of integration into daily routine, supporting a lower effort requirement.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner' due to the simple, approachable nature of the yoga practice, as supported by the description and short duration. The use of yoga in a 'quick & easy' context is primarily accessible to those new to fitness. 'Intermediate' is included due to potential variation in participant flexibility or balance capabilities as a 'full body' session might require more stamina or practice. 'Advanced' is acknowledged minimally because consistent yoga practitioners can integrate this into their routine efficiently, as indicated by comments appreciating the quickness and clarity of instruction."
