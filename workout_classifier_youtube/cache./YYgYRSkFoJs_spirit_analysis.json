  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified as 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.7 due to the emphasis on toning and strengthening using a set of dumbbells at home. The specific targeting of muscle groups such as legs, shoulders, and arms, along with tags like 'full body strength workout' and 'muscle building home workout', suggests a methodical approach typical of structured training. \n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' classification with a score of 0.6 is supported by the high view count, the use of weights for muscle building, and the need for warm-up and cool down as described in the metadata, indicating a workout that likely involves significant physical exertion. The comments also mention modifications needed post-surgery, implying a challenging workout level.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are not applicable here due to the lack of emphasis on smooth movements or relaxation. 'Outdoor & Adventure' is excluded due to the at-home setting, and 'Sport & Agility' is not indicated by the content's focus on general toning and strength rather than sports-specific skills."
