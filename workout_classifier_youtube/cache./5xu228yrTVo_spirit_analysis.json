  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video '10 Minute Body Weight Workout' from WebMD manifests a strong \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit. This is indicated by the use of terms like 'routine' and 'interval training', suggesting a methodical approach to exercise. The keyword 'exercise routine' and the description mention of a 'full-body fitness routine' hint at a systematic workout, warranting a high structured score of 0.7. Additionally, a \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit is present, supported by the description's focus on 'boosting energy' and 'building lean muscle', aligning with high-energy attributes, albeit in a compact session format, thus scoring 0.6. User comments commend the short, manageable nature, signifying emotional structure rather than an overwhelming high-energy aspect in its brevity and inclusivity, which further balances the classified spirits. Other spirits like \"Flow & Rhythm\" and \"Soothing & Restorative\" are less suitable due to the absence of rhythm-focused or relaxation-inducing descriptions."
