  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises described in the comments and metadata, such as jumping jacks, side bends, and mountain climbers, are generally considered beginner movements that require minimal coordination. Plank jacks and ski hops may introduce a slight increase in complexity, aligning partially with intermediate technique. The diversity in exercises that require some coordination justifies a moderate score of 0.4 for intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 15 minutes long, primarily featuring cardio and bodyweight exercises such as running in place and mountain climbers. This would yield moderate energy expenditure, supported by commentary mentioning a 'burn' in abs and increasing intensity over days. With a focus on continuous movement and minimal rest, it aligns well with a moderate score, with a slight overlap into challenging due to pace and exercise variety.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulty, the required fitness level fits both beginner and intermediate categories. The workout's 15-minute duration aligns with a beginner's capacity, but the cardio and combination of exercises imply intermediate demands, especially for participants needing to maintain routine. User feedback suggests adaption over time, indicating scalability to intermediate exercises."
