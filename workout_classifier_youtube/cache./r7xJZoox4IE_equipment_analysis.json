  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as \"Lazy Girl Full Body Fat Burn Workout | 10 Mins | No Jumping, Low Impact, At Home,\" which strongly suggests a bodyweight-based workout since it emphasizes being apartment-friendly and involves no jumping. The description lists exercises such as \"Feet Slide & Scissor Arms,\" \"Glute Bridge Forward March,\" and \"Side Lying Knee Tap Extensions,\" which can typically be done using just bodyweight. No specific equipment is mentioned in the title or description, and the tags reiterate that it is a low impact, no jumping workout, further supporting the lack of equipment requirement. The phrases \"No Jumping, Low Impact, At Home\" suggest the workout is designed for minimal equipment use, focusing on accessibility and ease. Additionally, the top comments do not mention the use of any equipment, indicating the workout can be completed without additional tools, confirming a bodyweight-only approach. Thus, no equipment is needed for this workout."
