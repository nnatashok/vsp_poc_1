    "My buddies were making fun of me a couple months ago when I told them I was watching you on YouTube as a way of motivation to get fit. Now I got a solid and visible six pack. All it takes is determination, consistency and hard work. It\u2019s your body so why not go for it and achieve your goals. Thanks so much",
    "This was my first workout I tried from you. 3 months later, what a difference in my body. I started in 85 as a teen but I trained in the in the 90s- 05. I really started working out and changing my eating habits to the days of old. With your motivating videos  I don\u2019t feel I have been working out alone. Thanks for helping me get rid of my Dad bod. Keep making videos and I will keep following you. \ud83d\udc4d",
    "I am following you for more than one year, and you are my big inspiration! I started bodyweight workouts and lifting at the gym just because of you :) I used to be really skinny, but in last 6 months I gained 28lbs of lean muscles, with no added fat. I took meal plan for gaining muscles at OnlyMeal, and now I exercise at least 4 times per week. Thank you very much, you are the reason why I am looking like a man now.",
