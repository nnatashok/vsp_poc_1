    "my dad sent me this because I freak out crying with anxiety and I can&#39;t breathe half the time, he sent me this to try, it&#39;s definetly working \u2764\ufe0f thank you",
    "This works if you practice it everyday 10 minutes per day for a month. <br><br>Your brain starts forming neural pathways and the longer and more consistently you practice this the stronger those neural pathways become. <br><br>Do it for one month and write a journal. <br><br>I guarantee you&#39;ll make awesome progress!",
    "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJJazKtH_9I&amp;t=19\">0:19</a> exercise starts here (forget everything you know and just be present like a newborn taking its first breaths, you know nothing) \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd",
    "After I did this. I felt euphoric. My limbs tingled. My arms became heavy. My face felt heavy and my brain felt like it had been dunked in ice cold water but not in a shocking way. I did it with my eyes closed and followed the breath noises. By the end of the time, my mind was quiet and honestly, I felt almost in a trance like state."
