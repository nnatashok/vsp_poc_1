  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video, titled \"5 Minute Guided Meditation for Clearing Blockages & Negativity,\" aligns predominantly with \"The Zen Flow\" and \"The Deep Recharge\" vibes. The video's focus on guided meditation implies an experience that is breath-centered and intentional, with an aim for grounding and unhurried presence, consistent with \"The Zen Flow.\" The high confidence score (0.95) reflects the explicit focus on breath and mindfulness as mentioned in the description and top comments, highlighting experiences of peace, clarity, and balance. \n\nAdditionally, the vibe of \"The Deep Recharge\" fits well due to the video's intention to clear blockages and negative energy, which echoes a nervous system and energy reset, meriting a slightly lower score (0.75) because the primary focus seems to be more on ongoing mindfulness rather than complete relaxation. \n\nThe tags like \"clearing blockages\" and \"guided meditation\" reinforce a restorative theme, while user comments further indicate feelings of tranquility and emotional relief, all of which guide the classification toward these specific vibes."
