  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified as 'Yoga' with high confidence (1.0 score) due to several strong indicators: the video title mentions 'Yoga Journey,' and the channel is dedicated to yoga practices, indicated by tags like '30 day yoga challenge,' 'move yoga with adriene,' and 'home yoga practice.' The description references deepening the relationship with one's subtle body and breath, which aligns with yoga principles.\n\nThe secondary category 'Meditation' is included with moderate confidence (0.5 score) as the description and comments emphasize mindfulness and internal observation, such as focusing on breath and subtle body awareness, suggesting elements of meditation are integrated into the practice.\n\nOther categories were considered but excluded due to lack of specific evidence. For example, while stretching is involved in yoga, the video is clearly part of a dedicated yoga series and not solely focused on flexibility exercises."
