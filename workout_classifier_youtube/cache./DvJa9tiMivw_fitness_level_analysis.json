  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a short 8-minute Pilates stretching routine described as suitable for starting your day, even in pajamas, which suggests simplicity and accessibility. The tags and comments further highlight it as a 'low impact' workout. Pilates, depending on the exercises, can range from beginner to intermediate, but the emphasis on feeling refreshed and the user comments about ease and routine nature suggest a predominant beginner level. There may be a slight intermediate element due to Pilates requiring some body awareness and coordination, but the overall approach and comments about ease support a strong beginner classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 8 minutes and the focus on 'morning stretch' and 'refreshing' imply a light energy expenditure. Comments from viewers express the workout as a relaxing, daily routine, emphasizing its suitability for daily, non-tiring engagement. While Pilates can sometimes elevate effort to moderate levels due to the need for control and core engagement, the short duration and stretching focus strongly align with a light effort categorization.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the light effort and beginner technique difficulty, this workout is ideally suited for beginners, with user comments indicating its ease and adaptability into daily routines. However, Pilates inherently includes elements that require some degree of control and core activation, justifying the inclusion of an intermediate level for those less familiar with Pilates or with less developed core stability. The emphasis on feeling refreshed and its description as doable even in pajamas highly supports the beginner classification, with a moderate acknowledgment of intermediate potential due to Pilates' typically engaging nature."
