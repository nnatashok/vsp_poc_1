  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves seated movements such as 'jack, pinch, twist, and kick' which are straightforward and do not require advanced coordination or balance. The use of a chair simplifies the complexity, making it accessible for users with limited mobility or those looking for low impact exercise options, as evidenced by phrases like 'low impact workout' and 'perfect if you have an injury, disability, limited mobility.'",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'no impact' and involves seated exercises which are generally low intensity, aligning with a 'Light' effort level. However, the description mentions 'Burn calories and boost your metabolism' and indicates that the routine can 'challenge your heart,' suggesting it could be somewhat demanding for completely sedentary individuals, thus supporting a 'Moderate' effort classification. The 24-minute duration contributes to the moderate score as it's on the longer side for low-impact routines.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the low technique difficulty and light to moderate effort difficulty, the workout is suitable for 'Beginner' users, particularly those new to exercise or with limited mobility. The intermediate score reflects the workout's potential to provide enough challenge to those with minimal fitness experience, as seen in comments from users like the 16-year-old who found the workout beneficial despite trying fitness for the first time. 'Advanced' fitness level is included with a lower score due to the possibility of increasing workout intensity ('get a satisfying workout') for more experienced individuals seeking low-impact exercise, although it is primarily tailored for beginners."
