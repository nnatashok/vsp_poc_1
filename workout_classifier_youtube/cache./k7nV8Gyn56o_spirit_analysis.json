  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as \"High-Energy & Intense\" with very high confidence (score: 0.95) as the title highlights \"BEST OF HIIT\" and \"INTENSE,\" and the description repeatedly emphasizes its high-energy nature, involving \"dripping sweat,\" \"super high energy songs,\" and intense calorie burn (80-160 kcal in 10 minutes). User comments also reflect the intense difficulty they experience. \"Flow & Rhythm\" is chosen (score: 0.7) due to the music-driven nature of the workout, as described in the metadata, with elements borrowed from previous \"Happy Dance,\" \"R&B Dance,\" and \"Happy Sweat\" workouts, suggesting a rhythm and groove element driving movement. The combination of the intense HIIT format with the music elements justifies the strong presence of these spirits, while others like \"Soothing & Restorative\" and \"Structured & Disciplined\" were excluded due to lack of relevant indicators."
