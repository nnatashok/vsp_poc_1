    "Anyone else trying to get flexible now that they&#39;re stuck in their house with nothing better to do?<br><br>Update #2: I missed a couple of days, but I have mostly been doing this for 3 weeks every night and I am SO much closer to being able to touch my toes. I&#39;ve never been able to do that or do the splits, but I tried going down into the splits position and I was the closest I&#39;ve ever been. I was still like 6 inches from the ground, but progress is what is important in this case. Once you make it a routine, you find yourself wanting to stay in the stretches even longer even though it hurts a little bit because you can feel the muscles stretching. How are you guys doing? Have you noticed any improvements?<br><br>Update! I have been doing this consistently for the past two weeks and I have seen a MAJOR difference. When I tell you that I am NOT flexible at all, I mean it. I&#39;m going to keep doing this every night before I go to sleep just to have a routine. My biggest piece of advice would be to focus on your breathing while you are stretching. Keep up the good work, guys! :)",

    "This is definitely for beginners. I\u2019m not a flexible person either but doing this everyday has made me very flexible. (This is after COMMITTING for several months. Not just a day then complaining about it) when I first started I couldn\u2019t stretch anywhere near as much as she did but I stretched as much as I could without overdoing it/hurting myself. Being sore after it\u2019s normal(not hurting but sore, like working out after not doing it for a good while) consistency is 100% key. Every week or even day if you can, push yourself to stretch deeper than the week/day before. Again, never overdo it, as you can end up actually hurting yourself. \ud83d\udc9b (also drinking plenty of water and keeping up with a healthy diet and lifestyle/Mindset is a huge help)"
