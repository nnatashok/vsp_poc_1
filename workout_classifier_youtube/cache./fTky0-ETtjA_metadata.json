  "title": "10 Minute Pilates Arm Workout | Quick Upper Body Workout with Light Weights",
  "description": "Hello everyone! Join me for an arm workout with weights. Weights are optional here, you can use your bodyweight. \n\nI\u2019m using 1kg dumbells, but feel free to choose your own weight level, from 0.5 to 3kg. If you don't have dumbells at home, you can always use cans of food, milk/juice cartons, bottles of water, or whatever you have handy, just make sure they don't spill! \n\nRemember to switch on those arm muscles throughout this workout, show me those muscles - you need to give yourself that resistance (especially if you're not using weights or you're using a light pair). I always say, 'think you're holding on to heavy weights' or 'pretend you're moving your arms through melted chocolate or melted cheese!' \n\nFeel free to shake out those arms if needed, and then jump right back in! See you soon! Emma x\n\nIf you enjoyed this arms workout, please remember to like, share, subscribe and comment if you have any questions, suggestions or feedback.\n\nMake sure you check out our other great at home Pilates workouts on the Club Forme channel.\n\nI hope to see you here again soon!\n\nEmma x\n\n#pilates #armsworkout #pilatesarmworkout\n\n\nFollow Club Forme on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/club.forme/\nFollow Emma on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/emmaspencerlelek/\n\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nThis is my own personal workout and it may not be suitable for you.
