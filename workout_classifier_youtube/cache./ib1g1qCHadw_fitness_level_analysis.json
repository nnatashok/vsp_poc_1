  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the Intermediate/Advanced technique and Challenging effort, the workout primarily suits Intermediate individuals. However, adjustable equipment (dumbbells) and potential for modification means motivated beginners may partake, thus inclusion of Beginner. The duration and technical elements make it less ideal but not impossible for beginners, with a stronger suggestion towards Intermediate and Advanced users. Community comments noting challenge and prior experience lend additional support to this level distribution."
