    "Another intense workout. I wish I had known about GCN sooner! Thanks!",
    "I really really enjoyed this. Thanks! Bring back GCN weekly sessions!",
    "Pretty pleased with myself to have completed this, as I\u2019m 70. Whenever I go to a spin class at my local Pure Gym I normally find I\u2019m at least 40 years older than anybody else. But who cares.",
    "We tackled assembling the bike as a family project. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxzg0clhbtRf2gGxPkVETFKJJKGqdsorQu\">https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxzg0clhbtRf2gGxPkVETFKJJKGqdsorQu</a>  The package is heavy, but I have 2 teen boys that were able to move it. The written instructions were great- we didn&#39;t need to watch the videos, but it was good knowing that the option was there if we needed it. After we were able to get it set up, the boys each rode 3 miles and I rode 8 and the bike stayed quiet. The display is easy to reset, and you can put it on whichever setting you are using (time, distance, calories, etc). I will say that my butt is a little sore from the seat, but that could be because I haven&#39;t rode in a while. While it is comfortable for me, it was not comfortable with the seat position for my friend (could not move the seat back far enough and he slightly looked like a kid riding a tricycle that he had outgrown). He also said that the seat hurt his manly parts. We are going to look for a different seat that will be compatible with this bike for him.I did purchase the Wahoo Cadence sensor and strapped it to the crank of one of the pedals. This will sync with my Apple Watch, iPhone and will import data in to my Health app. Wahoo does have other sensors available other than cadence. I can also keep either my phone or my iPad on the display and they both feel pretty secure.",
    "Without a doubt the most brutal GCN video I\u2019ve done. Thought it would be pretty easy after the 1hr reverse pyramids, but this went next level at the 20 minute mark! Savage."
