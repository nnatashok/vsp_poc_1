    "Leg day videos are underrated. I like how you included natural leg extensions, so good for quad strength and length.",
    "Recently I learned how effective this can be, after back issues prevent me from loaded squats and leg presses.",
    "Jump swuat and jumping lunges are my go to. You really feel the whole leg not only the glutes and quads, but also calves and the inner thigh",
    "Thank you!<br><br>I was injured &amp; have an endocrine issue that gets me sick when I move. I move: I get sick. The more I more the sicker I get, blah-blah.<br><br>Point is I am developing techniques to regain strength! I stop in to check you out for inspiration and reality check. Thanks.<br><br>What I do is to slow down the movement to increase the volume. Even to the point of stances. I use targeted pulsing and twitching to fatigue local muscles. The slower movement shows up comparative unevenness in movement. And assist in repair in loss of &#39;mind-body&#39; connection. It locates points of weakness or even stiffness that when I&#39;m moving quickly, I don&#39;t notice. This accumulates and is notable in the tissue growth around joints! I&#39;m 67, just healing up from a sciatica parting gift from an injury. Almost 7 months I couldn&#39;t move. Mass pain. So I did these movements seated. Now? 3rd day no pain &amp; able to balance on 1 leg. Issues folding forward, I was seated most day, to be resolved. My legs &amp; arms are &#39;firm&#39;. I&#39;m not rattling around feeling loose on my joints. I can bump into stuff, I can roll and play. Not to oversell, I&#39;m still sore!<br><br>Now my plan is to ramp up so I can give gaining real movement skills, my all, and see how far I can take it!"
