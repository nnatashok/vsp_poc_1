This implies minimal complexity in movement execution, requiring little coordination or balance. This is further supported by user comments and the description emphasizing the ability to perform these exercises while lying down, suggesting very straightforward movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is mainly Light, with a minor consideration for Moderate. The workout is designed to be performed in bed, indicating low energy expenditure. Comments from users indicate that the workout is suitable even for those with limited mobility or motivation, reinforcing the 'Light' classification. However, some users mention feeling a 'burn', suggesting that for very deconditioned individuals, there may be elements of a Moderate challenge.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is predominantly Beginner, with a slight extension to Intermediate. The exercises are explicitly stated to be 'easy' and feasible for those unable to leave their bed. This aligns heavily with a Beginner classification. However, given that some users report noticeable effects like a 'burn' or weight loss over time, there's a minimal nod to Intermediate, considering slight increases in challenge for completely deconditioned users."
