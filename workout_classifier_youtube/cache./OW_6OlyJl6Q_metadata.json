    "I started working out after some bad healt issues using your videos and I have been working out 4-5 times every week, almost 5 months in a row. Loved this one a lot! Today my 6 year old son did many things with me from your workout (I was suprised seeing him doing some things really well, like a pro \ud83d\ude05) and when he saw you having hard time, he was cheering you up! <br>I really wanted you to know that. You are helping so many other people around the world and so many are cheering up for you! \u2764 All the best from Estonia! \ud83e\udd70",
    "Anna, this one was my favorite one yet. Please load more of these. Your have been the only YouTube trainer that I workout with consistently for over 2 years. One day I challenged my husband to join me because he has a tendency to underestimate girls. He loves working with men with big muscles. He joined me a year ago and the first time he nearly threw up but he continued doing your videos with me 3-4/week. Let me tell you, he lost weight and he gets so many compliments and he can\u2019t stop bragging about your videos. Thank you from Miami Florida. You have changed our lives and best of all you have videos for everything we want to do.",
    "That was a real killer challenge \ud83d\ude05. \u2764The format, slow and steady building up pace and intensity. Worked every muscle.\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4f",
    "Thanks",
    "the word &quot;killer&quot; here perfectly suits this workout(in the end, I couldn&#39;t longer do squats with jumps, so settled on regular squats)\ud83d\ude05. but this is not a disadvantage. I enjoyed the workout for 100% and feel that I am growing. thank you, Anna! it was incredible\ud83d\udc97"
