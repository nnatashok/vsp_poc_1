  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'High-Energy & Intense', as indicated by the incorporation of High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which is explicitly mentioned in both the title and description. This workout focuses on quick, high-effort rounds designed to elevate heart rate and burn calories, which aligns with the 'High-Energy & Intense' category. The score given is 0.7, reflecting the intensity of HIIT even though it is tailored for beginners. \n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is also applicable here, reflected in the use of specific intervals (40s/20s) and a defined set of movements, which implies a methodical approach to the workout. This structured format provides clear guidance for beginners, earning it a score of 0.6 due to the clear interval setting and exercise sequence.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm', 'Soothing & Restorative', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the indoor nature, lack of emphasis on smoothness or recovery, and absence of sports-specific or outdoor elements. The comments indicate the workout's intensity, supporting the chosen spirits and confidence level."
