  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a Pilates routine, which typically involves exercises requiring body awareness and core engagement. While Pilates can have complex movements, the metadata does not specify high levels of technical complexity beyond basic Pilates exercises, suggesting it might still be suitable for beginners. The specific mention of 'full body pilates workout' and 'tone, sculpt, lean' hints at traditional Pilates exercises, aligning with intermediate technique due to some coordination and core control required.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is 21:35 minutes, slightly exceeding the 20-minute mark, pushing it to moderate or challenging for beginners. Tags such as 'fat burn' and 'intense 20 minute' suggest a higher energy expenditure than typical light workouts. The comments noting increased heart rate and physical responses hint at a challenging effort for less fit users. It's framed as a full body workout, potentially engaging multiple muscle groups intensively, which may translate to higher effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Despite potential complexity in movements, the Pilates workouts are generally scalable. The mention of 'intense' and 'full body' exercises alongside the 21-minute duration indicates it might be too challenging for true beginners but fits mildly active users or those with prior Pilates experience. The description suggests it's part of a broader fitness regime, which could appeal to intermediate users aiming for fat loss and muscle toning, and advanced users seeking regularity in Pilates workouts. Community feedback reflects varied fitness levels, indicative of its adaptability."
