  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit 'Soothing & Restorative' was chosen due to prominent language in the title and description advocating relaxation, injury prevention, and muscle relief: \"RELAX,\" \"refreshing post-workout stretch,\" \"relieve tight muscles,\" and \"prevent injuries.\" This suggests a strong focus on recovery and stress reduction, fitting the Soothing & Restorative spirit with very high confidence (score: 0.9).\n\nThe secondary spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' is selected due to the emphasis on continuous movement with terms like \"full-body stretches\" and the flowing sequence of exercises, which aligns partly with the continuous movement aspect, albeit with moderate confidence (score: 0.5).\n\nOther potential spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' were not selected, as the workout is designed for recovery, and there is no indication of intensity, rigid structure, or sports-like agility."
