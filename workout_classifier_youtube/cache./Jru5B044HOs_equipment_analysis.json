  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"The Scientific 7 Minute Workout Video - Bodyweight Only Total Body Workout\" clearly indicates that it requires no equipment, as it explicitly states it is a \"Bodyweight Only\" workout. This is further reinforced by the tags which include phrases like \"bodyweight workout,\" \"7 minute workout,\" and \"at home cardio,\" suggesting that the exercises are designed to be performed without any additional tools. The description and top comments do not mention any specific equipment being used, nor do they suggest any alternatives, confirming that the workout is exclusively bodyweight. Therefore, no equipment is classified as required for this workout."
