  "categoriesExplanation": "The video's title, description, and tags strongly suggest a HIIT workout: '10 Min Fat Burning Workout | No Equipment' and multiple tags such as 'highintensity', 'best fat burning', and 'burn fat fast'. The description emphasizes calorie burning and muscle definition, typical of HIIT. The presence of exercises such as burpees and jumping jacks (from comments) indicates short bursts of high-intensity activity, characteristic of HIIT, justifying a score of 0.9 for this category.\n\nThe workout uses no equipment ('No Equipment') and focuses on exercises utilizing body weight, thus supporting a classification of 'Body weight' with a score of 0.7. The comment mentioning the workout's difficulty and subsequent strength gains suggests bodyweight resistance.\n\nThe presence of words like 'calisthenics' in the tags and description ('Perfect Full Body Workout For Beginners', 'calisthenics move') imply a calisthenics approach, justifying a score of 0.6. The primary focus and channel's reputation bolster confidence in these classifications."
