  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Full Body Flow | 20-Minute Yoga Practice' is strongly aligned with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The description emphasizes setting an intention, flowing with energy and ease, and creating a moving meditation. These phrases indicate a slow, intentional, and breath-centered practice, typical of 'Zen Flow'. The emphasis on synchronizing breath with movement and cultivating a sense of balance further supports this classification. \n\nThe mention of making it a 'fun and supportive' experience with elements of full-body love suggests a 'Groove Session' vibe, as these are fun, fluid, and expressive. The use of phrases like 'get the juices flowing' indicates a playful and engaging dynamic, hence a moderate score here.\n\nComments indicate continuous progress and appreciation of the steady nature, resonating with 'The Meditative Grind'. Regular practice is mentioned by users as being transformative, indicative of a repetitive, focused grind.\n\nOther vibes were excluded due to lack of intense or competitive elements that are absent in typical yoga sessions."
