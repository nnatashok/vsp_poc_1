  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is clearly targeted at beginners, as indicated by the video title \"BEGINNER FLEXIBILITY ROUTINE\" and multiple tags such as \"beginner flexibility,\" \"beginner stretch,\" and \"stretches for the inflexible.\" The comments also reinforce that the movements are simple and suitable for those with little flexibility experience. Stretching routines generally involve straightforward movements, and the description highlights that it is suitable for 'anyone in need of a great stretch,' indicating minimal complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video is designed as a light stretching routine that focuses on increasing flexibility, which generally entails low energy expenditure. The routine is described as a '30 min stretch routine' for flexibility, not high intensity. The tags also suggest it is a light workout. However, due to the 32-minute duration, it may require a moderate level of effort for someone starting their fitness journey, adjusting the score slightly upwards for 'moderate.'",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner,' consistent with the focus on simple stretching exercises designed for the inflexible, with numerous indications of beginner suitability in the metadata. The workout's length (over 30 minutes) and the more frequent engagement might necessitate some moderate level of fitness if followed without modification, allowing for a lower 'Intermediate' score as well. The audience comments also support the idea that absolute beginners commit to the routine to see progress, further incentivizing including 'Intermediate' for slightly more experienced participants."
