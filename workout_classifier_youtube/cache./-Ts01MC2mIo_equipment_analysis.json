  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title, 'Chair Yoga | Yoga With Adriene,' explicitly indicates the use of a chair for this yoga practice. The description reinforces this by stating 'Chair Yoga invites you to find mobility in a way that is soft and gentle but also really supportive and beneficial.' Additionally, tags such as 'chair yoga,' 'chair yoga for seniors,' 'yoga in chair,' and 'desk yoga' suggest that the chair is a central component of the workout. The comments further support this as they mention the chair yoga routine and its benefits. All these points contribute to a very high confidence score of 0.9 that a chair is required for the workout."
