  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is explicitly titled '15 Min Full Body Stretch for Flexibility & Mobility,' strongly indicating that the main focus is on stretching routines, which justifies scoring the 'Stretching' category at 1.0. The repeated emphasis on 'stretching,' 'flexibility,' and 'mobility' in both the title and description highlights the clear objective of enhancing range of motion and reducing muscle soreness, further solidifying the classification as stretching.\n\nThe use of phrases like 'full body stretch,' 'flexibility stretches,' and 'relaxing stretch' in the tags reinforce this focus. Additionally, user comments emphasize the stretch's ability to aid in relaxation and flexibility improvement.\n\nThe score of 0.4 for 'Other' accounts for any potential complementary aspects like light cooling off and relaxing benefits, indicated by terms such as 'reduce stress' and 'calm,' although these do not comprise the primary purpose of the workout."
