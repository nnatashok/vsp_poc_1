    "Breathe. Lower your shoulders. Soften the skin of your forehead. Thank you Adriene. A beautiful way to start, or end, the day.  Knowing that so many others are experiencing this practice is so comforting! \ud83c\udfb6",
    "Shoutout to those of us who are a couple of days behind, but still hanging in there! You&#39;re doing great!",
    "I love how at the end of every practice, there is just enough time after Adriene says Namaste for me to say Namaste in return before the music fully drops in.",
    "You might say it becomes more difficult over time to find space to practice, but to me actually I really have started to crave the yoga. My body needs it, so I look forward to it each day!",
    "Today I didn&#39;t really feel like doing yoga, I wanted to skip today because yesterday I cried for three hours and I didn&#39;t have the strength to do yoga. However, after making it, I started crying and not out of sadness but out of gratitude. even though I didn&#39;t feel strong enough, I did it and I&#39;m very proud of myself, thank you Adriene for today, you are amazing and thank you for the fact that I can practice with you thank you that despite these bad times, I can forget for a moment and focus on myself, thank you very much \u2764\ufe0f let&#39;s take care of ourselves and have a wonderful, peaceful Sunday for everyone \u2764\ufe0f"
