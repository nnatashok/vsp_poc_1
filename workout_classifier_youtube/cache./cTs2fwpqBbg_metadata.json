    "Let us know how you find this session! \ud83d\udc47",
    "I\u2019ve been doing this workout for years, but on a basic indoor spinning bike (where I was guessing effort based on heart rate and gear). However, this Christmas I dropped a million hints to my husband (who blames you, GCN) that I wanted to upgrade to a wahoo smart trainer for my road bike. I was so stoked to get one and along with the wahoo app (which can act like an elemnt which toggles effort) it has totally opened up a whole new world of pain and fun. It\u2019s been so awesome to go back through all these GCN workouts and work to be spot on with my cadence and effort. Thanks, guys!",
    "GCN motto should be:<br><br>\u201cThe Ministry of sweat\u201d<br><br>Yet another brutal session,absolutely brilliant,the GCN team never fails to deliver.<br>It does not matter 15min or 60min you will drenched with sweat at the end.<br>The GCN team have changed the lives of many people,both physically and mentally.<br>Please don\u2019t ever stop producing these amazing workout sessions\u2026\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffd",

    "Matt Stephens, do you know how good you are doing this? Your comments on what the benefits are of your work out and the info you give on cycling and how it benefits the body is SO amazing and so good to hear while you are dying, and thinking of quitting. You ROCK, just loving your classes! Thank you so much!"
