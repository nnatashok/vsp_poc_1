  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is influenced by the fact that indoor cycling primarily involves pedaling with varied resistance, which is a simple movement (beginner level). However, the 'advanced level' tag and 'focussed blocks of intensity' suggest a higher degree of coordination and awareness is needed, elevating it to an advanced level for the intended audience. Given the disclaimer and metadata specifying 'advanced level', the technique also involves certain coordination and cadence control typically considered intermediate to advanced.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a '60 Minute Indoor Cycling Workout | Endurance Ride' which already suggests a high stamina demand. Keywords like 'high intensity', 'intense', 'calorie burner', and 'advanced indoor cycling' indicate high energy expenditure. The included music playlist also implies sustained effort through continuous engagement. With two focused intensity blocks and a long duration over 60 minutes, the overall effort demands are at the challenging to extreme end, particularly targeting well-conditioned cyclists.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the advanced technique difficulty and the extreme effort required, this workout is best suited for intermediate to elite levels. The emphasis on 'advanced level' and a one-hour duration shifts the accessibility more towards conditioned individuals. However, intermediate users with a good fitness base could adapt according to their capacity, hence the inclusion of intermediate. The metadata emphasizes that participants must be medically fit, supporting this higher fitness level classification."
