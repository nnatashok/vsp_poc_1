  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is titled 'Yoga for Weight Loss' and includes tags like 'yoga for beginners,' suggesting it is designed for those with limited experience. Yoga typically involves coordination and balance but within beginner and intermediate yoga poses these are manageable with some practice. User comments indicate that the exercises are accessible yet challenging, implying a mix of easy and slightly complex movements. Thus, both beginner and intermediate levels are appropriate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 31-minute duration indicates a moderate effort due to length. Comments reference being 'drenched in sweat' and 'feeling the burn,' suggesting moderate to slightly challenging intensity. Yoga's low-impact nature with an emphasis on holding poses can increase heart rate modestly while still being approachable. Given these insights, the effort difficulty is placed primarily at a moderate level, with some consideration for challenging, especially for deconditioned users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique difficulty being predominantly beginner, combined with a moderate effort level, suggests the workout is suitable for both beginners and those slightly more conditioned (intermediate). The video's length slightly shifts it toward intermediate, but keywords like 'yoga for beginners' alongside comments from users improving over days indicate that a beginner can approach this yoga session effectively. Therefore, it includes both beginner and intermediate levels equally."
