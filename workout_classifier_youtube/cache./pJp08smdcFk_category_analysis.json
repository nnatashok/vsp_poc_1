  "categoriesExplanation": "The video focuses on core strengthening exercises mainly using body weight, which aligns with the 'Body weight' category. Exercises such as reverse crunches, side plank, and bird dog require no equipment, highlighting the strong presence of body-weight exercises (score 0.9). The term 'home workout' in the description and the listed exercises further support this classification. The mention of 'exercise mat' implies a 'Mat' workout setting, though this is secondary to the body weight aspect (score 0.8). The inclusion of exercises for core stability, and the potential back pain relief benefits suggest a slight presence of 'Stretching', due to overlap in muscle conditioning and flexibility improvement (score 0.3). Other categories such as Pilates or Yoga are excluded as there is no mention of specific controlled movements, breathing techniques, or meditation practices."
