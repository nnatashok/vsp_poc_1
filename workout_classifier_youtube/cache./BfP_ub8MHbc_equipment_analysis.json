  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a 5-minute full-body yoga practice, explicitly indicated in the title and supported by the channel's focus on yoga content. The description contains an affiliate link for a yoga mat with the phrase 'My yoga mat I use now', suggesting it is a key component of the workout. This implies a high likelihood that a yoga mat is used to provide a comfortable surface for the exercises. While the presence of yoga blocks is also suggested by a link, the description and format of the video (short and simple) suggest these are optional. Hence, the confidence for a mat is rated high at 0.8 as it is central to performing yoga routines, especially in a mostly floor-based practice."
