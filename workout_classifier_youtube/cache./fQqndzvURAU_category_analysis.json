  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Indoor biking', with a high confidence score of 0.9. This classification is strongly supported by the title '15 Minute Beginner Indoor Cycling Session' and repeated references in the tags and description to 'indoor cycling', 'spin class', 'spinning', and 'turbo trainer'. The channel focus is also on cycling, as indicated in the channel description, further reinforcing this as an indoor biking workout.\n\nA secondary category of 'HIIT' is suggested with a score of 0.7 due to the description outlining an interval-based workout structure with varying intensity levels, such as '1 Min Easy', '2 Min Comfortably hard', and a '30s Sprint'. These are characteristic features of HIIT, emphasized further by tags like 'interval', 'intervals', 'HIIT', and 'interval training'.\n\nOther categories such as 'Mat', 'Treadmill', or 'Weight workout' were considered unnecessary due to the strong focus on cycling and the lack of relevant indicators for these categories in the metadata."
