  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled 'LAZY GIRL COUCH WORKOUT... Do this workout while watching TV!' is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a very high confidence of 0.9 due to multiple factors indicating a gentle, low-impact nature. Phrases such as 'gentle', 'lazy girl workout', and 'low impact workout' suggest a restorative approach aimed at those needing a light exercise option, possibly for recovery or relaxation. The description also emphasizes the ability to perform the workout while watching TV, further reinforcing its accessible and non-intense demeanor, aligning well with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit.\n\nAdditionally, there are mild elements of 'Flow & Rhythm' warranted by the 'gentle morning wake-up workout' phrase, suggesting a smooth movement sequence, though the confidence is moderate at 0.4 due to limited explicit evidence related to rhythmic flow.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the absence of elements indicating high intensity or rigorous structure, while the lack of a sport-specific focus excludes 'Sport & Agility'. 'Outdoor & Adventure' does not apply as the workout is clearly designed to be performed indoors at home."
