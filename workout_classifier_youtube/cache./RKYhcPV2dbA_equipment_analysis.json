  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title and description suggest that no equipment is needed for this stretch routine, which primarily focuses on flexibility and mobility exercises. However, the description mentions a specific mat, \"THE MAT I USE (Exercise 6X4): http://gorillamats.com?aff=19 (MADFIT10 for 10% off),\" implying that a mat is recommended for comfort and support during these stretches. This is also common for stretching exercises to prevent slipping and provide cushioning, especially in an at-home setting, therefore, I assigned a high confidence score of 0.6 for the mat being required equipment. The presence of 'home workout' and 'stretching routine' tags further reinforce its necessity for an optimal experience, despite the lack of explicit requirement for other equipment."
