  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Stretching' with a high confidence level of 0.9, as the video is explicitly focused on a full-body stretching routine, intended for flexibility and mobility enhancement, which are typical stretching goals. Key phrases in the title and description such as 'Full Body Stretch,' 'Flexibility, Mobility,' 'stretch routine,' 'cool down after workout,' and 'mobility exercises' emphasize this focus. The tags further support this classification, consistently referring to 'stretch' and 'stretching.' \n\nYoga is assigned with lesser confidence at 0.4 since some yoga poses like 'Cobra Pose,' 'Lizard Pose,' and 'Warrior 1' are included in the routine, as seen in the description and time stamps. However, because the primary aim is stretching and not traditional yoga practice combining physical postures with specific breathing techniques or meditation, the confidence in the 'Yoga' category is not as high. The metadata lacks typical yoga mentions like 'flow' or 'mindfulness.' The high user engagement and positive comments mostly reinforce enjoyment and effectiveness, consistent with a focused stretching routine."
