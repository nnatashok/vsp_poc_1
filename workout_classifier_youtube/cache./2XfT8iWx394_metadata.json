    "I&#39;m 50 years young getting into yoga . <br>Thank you for the routine , enjoyed very much, got a lot out of it . Good pace and claim. Thanks again see you tomorrow \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7",
    "Preparing for the mcat and getting Covid shook me. I began losing control of my mind and body over the past few months. I want to feel safe with myself again and this video combined with a day of cleaning, my first run in over a month, and lots of rest give me hope. Thank you Bre and Flo.",
    "This is my favorite gentle yoga by far for recovery or right after workouts.   I neglected my yoga and meditation practice for over a year.  I was not being consistent every day and I practiced yoga and meditation here and there.  Life got in the way and it started to turn into a vicious cycle.  I live with chronic pain and illness, my pain started to get worse and I started to get nightmares again every night from my childhood trauma.  I started watching your channel again and implemented Tara Brach\u2019s meditation practices the last 3 days and I\u2019m already noticing a difference.  Thank you Bre and Flo!  I\u2019ve been waking up with less pain and my nightmares have settled down.  Much gratitude!  I will make sure to stay committed and not go off track.  It\u2019s not worth it.  Namaste \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\ude77",
    "My first week stretching for a long time. Every day I end up beaten thanks to flow, keep it going man, I feel the weakness leaving my body. As in mindfulness we say: just begin again. Good job sr"
