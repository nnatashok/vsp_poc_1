  "vibesExplanation": "The '10 MinUte Tone Your ARM Workout With WEIGHTS' video is primarily characterized by a structured and focused approach to arm training, targeting specific muscle groups like biceps, triceps, and shoulders. Its emphasis on technique and controlled movements aligns well with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe, as the video supports skill-building in upper body strength with weights. The detailed focus on correct form and targeting specific areas such as 'bat wings' strengthens this assessment. This vibe is rated at 0.7 due to the clear emphasis on technique and skill development implied by the workout's structured format.\n\nAdditionally, the video supports a vibe of 'The Foundation Builder,' as it targets fundamental areas often concerned with overall strength and functional fitness for an older demographic, including beginners and seniors. The consistent mention of arm muscle toning and combating 'bat wings' suggests a focus on strengthening weak points, hence scoring a 0.6. The comments from users about steady gradual progress and arm definition further reinforce this vibe. Less intense than a proper 'tactical athletic' workout, yet it methodically focuses on improving foundational strength."
