  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is a beginner yoga routine, as explicitly stated in the title ('20-Minute Beginner Yoga Routine | Gentle Flow With Blocks') and reiterated in the description ('beginner yoga routine', 'gentle, relaxing routine'). The extensive use of yoga blocks to support alignment and increase flexibility aligns with typical yoga practices focused on form and flexibility, justifying the Yoga category with a high score (0.9).\n\nThe tags and description also mention flexibility multiple times ('yoga for flexibility', 'increase flexibility'), suggesting a significant stretching component inherent in the yoga routine. This supports the inclusion of the Stretching category, though with a moderate score of 0.5, as it is a secondary focus compared to yoga itself.\n\nOther categories such as Pilates, Breathing exercises, and Meditation were considered but were not supported directly by the metadata. The emphasis on yoga practices, alignment, and relaxation through yoga blocks strongly supports the primary focus on Yoga and, to a lesser extent, Stretching."
