  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "This workout video is designed as a no jumping cardio routine that's gentle on the joints, which suggests a focus on bodyweight exercises. The video tags, description, and comments emphasize doing the workout at home without any equipment. The workout does not include any mention of weights, machines, or other typical gym equipment in its title, description, or tags. The channel also specifically mentions offering bodyweight workouts with no equipment required. The absence of any explicit mentions or implications for the need for equipment in the metadata, together with the channel\u2019s focus on no-equipment workouts, strongly suggests that this workout is bodyweight only, leading to a conclusion of an empty array for required equipment."
