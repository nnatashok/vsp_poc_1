  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified for this workout video is 'The Sleep Prep,' which aligns with the video title and description that focus on meditation for aiding sleep. Words like 'guided meditation to ease your mind and body into falling asleep' in the description are directly indicative of a sleep preparation session. The use of soothing relaxation music, as inferred from the tags, reinforces this vibe, hence a score of 1.0 due to its perfect embodiment.\n\nA secondary vibe, 'The Deep Recharge,' is also fitting given that the meditation aims for a 'nervous system reset' and involves 'ultra-gentle movement,' implied through the relaxation and calmness suggested in the title and description. This secondary vibe is reinforced by the comments reflecting on peacefulness and well-being; however, it is not the session's primary goal, thus receiving a score of 0.7.\n\nGiven the explicit focus on sleep and relaxation, other potential vibes such as 'The Zen Flow' were excluded because the emphasis is not on grounding breath-centered movement but instead on transitioning into restfulness and relaxation."
