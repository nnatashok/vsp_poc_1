  "categoriesExplanation": "The dominant category for this workout is 'Calisthenics' with a score of 0.9. This is strongly indicated by the title, tags, and description, which frequently mention 'calisthenics' and 'parallettes.' The video is clearly focused on calisthenics, explicitly targeting beginners and intermediates, and includes exercises that can be performed with or without equipment like parallettes. This suggests a high reliance on the calisthenics exercise style which is bolstered by multiple uses of the term in the metadata.\n\nA secondary category is 'Body weight', scored at 0.8, due to the emphasis on bodyweight exercises. The description and comments note that the workout is a bodyweight routine that can be performed without equipment, which aligns with bodyweight training characteristics.\n\nThe 'Other' category is assigned a minor score of 0.3. While this is primarily a calisthenics workout, the user comments and tags suggest exploration beyond basic calisthenics into general fitness territory, which aligns with the mixed style of the channel's broader content.\n\nNo other categories are applicable as the workout lacks elements like specific yoga, HIIT, or equipment-based activities relevant to other distinct workout categories."
