  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video contains a full body pilates workout described as \"Sequenced Flow... moving naturally from one series to the next,\" likely including standard pilates movements which require body awareness and coordination, typical of intermediate technique difficulty. Intermediate score is higher due to use of sequences and equipment (dumbbells), suggesting some coordination is needed. Beginner level is possible due to options for light dumbbells and adaptability of pilates.",

However, Beginner is still included, reflecting the adaptability of dumbbell selection and modification potential.
