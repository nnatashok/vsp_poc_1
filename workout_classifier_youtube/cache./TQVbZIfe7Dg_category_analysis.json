  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized primarily under 'Meditation' due to the explicit indication in the title and description, noting it as a 'guided meditation' by a renowned spiritual leader, Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. The tags like 'guided meditation', 'mindfulness', and 'transcendental meditation', alongside the description's mention of achieving a 'still mind', strongly support this classification with a high confidence score of 0.95, highlighting meditation as the central component.\n\nA secondary category is 'Breathing exercises', scored at 0.35, hinted by the mention of the 'Sudarshan Kriya' breathing technique in the description, though it is not the main focus of this particular video. The primary objective remains meditation, but the connection to breathing techniques is slightly evident, given the channel's broader content.\n\nOther categories like 'Yoga', 'Mat', or 'Stretching' are excluded due to the lack of emphasis on physical postures or mat-based exercises as per the video's description and metadata, further reinforcing meditation as the core activity here."
