  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled '10 Min HIIT Cycle Bike Workout' clearly specifies that it is a cycling workout, indicating the use of an exercise bike. The tags and description reinforce this by mentioning activities such as 'cycle workout', 'indoor cycle', and 'endurance belt drive magnetic indoor exercise cycle bike'. Additionally, the video is published by Sunny Health & Fitness, a channel known for promoting fitness equipment, specifically mentioning a magnetic indoor exercise cycle bike model. Therefore, with explicit mentions of cycling and bike equipment, the confidence level for the requirement of an exercise bike is very high at 1.0."
