    "This has quickly become my every day stretch- and its especially fantastic after a power ride and superset.",
    "I&#39;ve been doing this for a month now for pain management, and not only does this help with general pain, but I&#39;m also so much more flexible than I was before. Gonna have to branch out and see what else this channel has to offer."
