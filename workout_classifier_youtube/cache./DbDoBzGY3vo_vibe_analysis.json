Comments from users who mentioned feeling calm and steady after the session further support this classification, leading to a high score of 0.9.\n\nSecondly, the slow and intentional pacing indicated by the breathing exercises falls under 'The Zen Flow', characterized by grounding and breath-centered activities. The mention of extended exhales to aid relaxation supports this, giving it a strong score of 0.8. Additionally, terms like 'calm breathing' and 'relaxing breathing' in the tags reinforce this vibe.\n\nFinally, 'The Reboot Workout' is a suitable match, focusing on stress relief and offering a total-body refresh.
