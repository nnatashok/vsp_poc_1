  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "This workout video appears to be a bodyweight-only routine, focusing on stretching and mobility. The video's title and description emphasize a 'beginner friendly stretching routine' designed to improve flexibility and mobility without mentioning any specific equipment. The tags also focus on flexibility and stretching, with no indication of props like mats or blocks. Additionally, the comments reflect an appreciation for a simple, guided routine suitable for anyone, particularly noting its suitability for someone who is not yet flexible. There is no evidence from the metadata to suggest that any equipment is required to perform this workout, so the classification is an empty array, indicating a bodyweight-only routine."
