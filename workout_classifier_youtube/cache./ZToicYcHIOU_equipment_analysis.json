  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Daily Calm | 10 Minute Mindfulness Meditation | Be Present' is categorized as a guided meditation session, focusing on mindfulness and inner peace. The metadata, including the title, description, and tags (such as 'meditation', 'guided meditation', 'mindfulness'), strongly suggests that this session is purely mindfulness-based without any physical exercises involved. The comments further emphasize that the session is focused on meditation, with no mention of physical activity requiring equipment. Thus, no fitness equipment is necessary for this workout, and it appears to be a bodyweight, meditation-only session."
