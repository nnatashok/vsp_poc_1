    "I found this workout last week. <br>I bought the machine 5 months ago.<br>I had neck surgery and an ablation done, and I gained weight horribly. <br>I was doing it slow till I got to walk it to 2 miles.<br>Since I  started thus workout been going slow, today I completed the workout in full. <br>My husband looks at me and says he is very proud for sticking with it.",
    "I love all the sunny health elliptical workouts, they are so motivational. Without them, I would just do 20 min flat and maybe push myself once or twice and get fed up. I&#39;ve saved your elliptical playlist to have fast access to them all to choose from. An immense thanks for putting the workouts out there for free.",
    "I\u2019m 55 and I work a 50 + hour week.  And this workout is perfect. Only 10 minutes. Just awesome.  I\u2019ve dusted my machine off and I\u2019m doing this work out .  So glad I came across your video. Thank you!  \ud83d\udc95",
    "This is so good!! I am overweight  and have asthma, so exercising is challenging... anyway I work out to this video three times a week for 20 min now (I do the video twice). I started doing this and the goal was to be out of breath everyday for 10 min.... I had to pause because I couldn&#39;t keep up... within a month I do this 3 times a week for 20 min! Next goal is 30min! I started changing my lifestyle before is started to exercise and I lost a total of 12kg! Let&#39;s go!!! 20 more!!! Thank you Sydney!!",
    "After a stroke 3 years ago when 68 I changed earring habits and now do cardio &amp; light weights. I gone from 14.5stone to 10 st 10 lbs. The elliptical workouts like this one have been the backbone of my cardio as I have rheumatoid arthritis and 5 dropped bones in my feet so running hurts big time. Glad to report that I have recorded 3 mins 38 secs for 1 mile and 8 mins 20 for 2 mile sprints but mostly do 10 min &amp; 30 min HIIT on elliptical Nordic track 9.5 machine. Helps me relax, sleep better and feel pretty good for 71 today."
