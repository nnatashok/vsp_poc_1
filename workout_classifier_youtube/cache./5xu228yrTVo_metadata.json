    "Thanks, Michael, breaking it down into short, doable exercises and adding upgrades makes it manageable. I&#39;ll be coming back to this video a lot, I think.",
    "That&#39;s a good workout.  I walk a lot but no strengthening exercises for a  few years, so that was all I could do for now. OK I plan to be back every day and tone up!",
    "I look forward to your workouts every day. They&#39;ve really made a difference in my routine.",
    "Nice, helpful video.  I have to remind myself in the morning that I just need to do at least 10 minutes a day.  Thanks!",
    "Great video bodyweight excercise for beginners. Thanks for sharing \ud83d\udc4d"
