However, individuals with some experience in mindfulness practices (denoted by 'Intermediate') may also appreciate and benefit from it more deeply due to their prior exposure to meditation techniques. The low engagement required reinforces high suitability for beginners, while the intermediate assignment acknowledges the additional benefits for those with some meditation background."
