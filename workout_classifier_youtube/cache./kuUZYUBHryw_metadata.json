    "I&#39;ve been searching calisthenics for beginners foe two days and this is the only one that is actually easy to understand, and actually works out instead of just talking and no movement for 80% of the clip. Absolute legend",
    "This was the first workout I ever did for starting calisthenics and even though I&#39;ve been resistance training for 2 years, it was challenging but also easy enough to perform. I&#39;ll definitely continue, thanks!",
    "Between motocross wrecks and falling of of roof 10 yrs ago and everyday hard labor since I\u2019m a kid I am in the worst shape of my life, recently I\u2019ve got my back into better condition through hydration and good lifting techniques. I feel I\u2019m ready for this, anyone and everyone please root me on lol.<br>Thank for the video .<br><br>Jeff<br><br>Jeff",
    "Fantastic. No guff or posturing, just simple instructions I can follow in real time. Cheers mate."
