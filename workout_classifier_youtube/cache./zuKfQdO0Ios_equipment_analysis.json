  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video, titled \"20 Minute Guided Run | BEGINNER FRIENDLY,\" is a guided running workout designed for beginners. The description mentions that the workout can be performed \"outside or on a tread,\" indicating that a treadmill is an option for performing this run indoors. Since the treadmill is the only specific piece of equipment mentioned explicitly as a viable alternative to running outside, it is identified as required for those who do not have the ability to run outdoors. Thus, the confidence level is high (0.8), as the treadmill is directly mentioned as an option for undertaking this workout."
