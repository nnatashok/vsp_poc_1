  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.75. This is due to keywords like 'burn,' 'hiit,' and 'sweat,' and the emphasis on quick and effective workouts that hint at a fast-paced session designed to get results. The description highlights a 'quick but effective' 5-minute workout aiming for 'HUGE gains,' which aligns strongly with high-intensity exercise. \n\nThe second spirit, 'Structured & Disciplined,' scores 0.6. The tags and channel's focus suggest a methodical approach, especially with terms like 'calisthenics workout,' 'transformation,' and the presence of structured progressions in calisthenics, positioned by Chris Heria's expertise in elite fitness training and systematic approaches described in the channel information. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' and other spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the lack of any significant references to coordination, restorative goals, or nature-based activities in the metadata, keeping the focus on intensity and structure."
