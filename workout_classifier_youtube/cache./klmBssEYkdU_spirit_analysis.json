  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata strongly suggests a Soothing & Restorative workout spirit. The title, '10-Minute Morning Yoga,' and the description emphasize stress relief, tension release, and mental, emotional, and physical health improvements, aligning well with a restorative focus. The tags such as 'home yoga practice' and 'morning yoga' further support this spirit. The comments also highlight individuals using the routine to improve their well-being and start their day positively.\n\nThe Flow & Rhythm spirit is also relevant, supported by the description's suggestion of a 'quick but extremely beneficial routine,' implying smooth transitions and coordination. The comment about the routine being a 'dream' and 'gorgeous' further reinforces an implicit connection to flow, though less emphasized compared to the restorative aspect.\n\nOverall, the emphasis on starting the day with calm, restorative energy overshadows other spirits, leading to a very high confidence in the Soothing & Restorative classification and moderate to high confidence in Flow & Rhythm."
