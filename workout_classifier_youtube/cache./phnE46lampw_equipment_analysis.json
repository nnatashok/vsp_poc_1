  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '15 Min Full Body Daily Stretch for Tight Muscles, Soreness & Flexibility' focuses on a stretching routine aimed at improving flexibility and reducing soreness. The description emphasizes the idea of stretching as a form of recovery and self-care, and does not mention any specific equipment being required. The tags and comments indicate that it's a beginner-friendly stretch, suggesting it is likely designed to be accessible without additional equipment. Typically, stretching exercises require minimal to no equipment, and since there is no mention of mats or any props needed, it can be inferred that this session can be performed on a soft surface like a carpet. Therefore, the workout appears to require no equipment and is bodyweight only."
