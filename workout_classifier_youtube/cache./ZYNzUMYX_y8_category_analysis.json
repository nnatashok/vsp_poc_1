  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is \"Mat\" with a score of 0.9, because the workout is described as a routine that can be done at home without equipment, indicative of mat exercises. Phrases like \"home workout\" and the lack of additional equipment suggest floor exercises typically done on a mat. The second category assigned is \"Body weight\" with a score of 0.7, as the channel's description emphasizes body weight workouts and user comments reflect improved strength and muscle tone without mentioning equipment. The tags and description also highlight fat burning and cardio, aligning with body weight exercise features. Categories like \"Calisthenics\" or \"HIIT\" were not chosen since there is no emphasis on high intensity or gymnastic movements specifically, and the workout is designed to be done leisurely before bed."
