  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled \"30 Min FULL BODY CALISTHENICS WORKOUT at Home | Follow Along,\" and the tags include \"no equipment calisthenics workout,\" \"bodyweight strength workout,\" and \"bodyweight only,\" all of which strongly indicate that no equipment is needed for this workout. The description further confirms this by stating it is a \"bodyweight workout designed to improve your strength and mobility\" and adds that the workout can be done \"without equipment.\" There are no mentions of any equipment in the comments or other video metadata, supporting the conclusion that this is a purely bodyweight workout. Therefore, no equipment is required."
