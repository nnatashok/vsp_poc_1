    "I LOVED this 15 min class! I work in medicine and often have 12+ hr shifts. It makes it hard to get up earlier to do a full on workout. Even 20 min sometimes becomes hat]rider to fit in. But 15 min, that\u2019s hard to find an excuse and it puts me in a good place for the rest of the day. Thank you!"
