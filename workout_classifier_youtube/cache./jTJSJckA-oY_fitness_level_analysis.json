  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated as 'Beginner' primarily because the breathing meditation involves simple, non-technical instructions that can be easily followed by anyone, such as sitting or lying down comfortably. The focus on breath work and relaxation requires minimal to no physical movement, which supports a classification of beginner level. Additionally, an intermediate score is included due to the focus and consistent awareness required over a long duration to maintain the meditation, which may challenge some beginners. However, no complex movements or high levels of coordination or skill are involved.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 1.0,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Effort difficulty is classified as 'Light' because the activity is primarily mental and involves guided breathing and relaxation, which are inherently low in physical exertion. Though the session lasts 40 minutes, it focuses on stillness and calmness with minimal to no physical activity required, aligning strongly with a light effort difficulty. There are no mentions of high energy expenditure or cardiovascular exertion, reinforcing this classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner' due to the simplicity of the meditation practice, which requires no prior fitness or meditation experience to access. This aligns with the lightness of effort difficulty and the basic technique difficulty. An intermediate level is included due to the potential challenge for some to maintain focus and stillness for an extended period, especially for those new to meditation practices. The metadata and user comments reflect that even those initially skeptical or tense found accessibility and benefit in the practice, confirming its beginner-friendly nature with some intermediate attributes due to duration."
