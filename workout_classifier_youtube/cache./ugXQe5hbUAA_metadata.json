    "Hope you guys enjoyed version 2 of the beginner stretch series! It feels so good to take a few minutes out of the day to stretch and pay close attention to your body \u2764\ufe0f Sending you all love! Xx- Maddie",
    "As a yoga teacher, I couldn\u2019t agree more how important it is to take some time to stretch, increase range of motion and balance between strength and flexibility, effort and ease, engagement and relaxation especially in this uncertain period. Hope more people can join this \u2018letting go\u2019 practice with us. <br><br>I appreciate your consistant sharing with such a lovely intention and dedication, it means a lot to us, Maddie\ud83d\udc95",

    "Some of these stretches were a little difficult to evaluate, like I wasn&#39;t sure if I was doing them correctly sometimes because I am SO inflexible that I have trouble really copying them in form haha. But if you feel the stretch, it means it&#39;s working! So if you&#39;re like me, then don&#39;t give up, and keep stretching &lt;3",
    "Hey Maddie, can you do a stretch routine focused on the back? I work seated all day and I would really appreciate that!"
