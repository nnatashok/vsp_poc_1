  "categoriesExplanation": "This workout video focuses on 'neck and shoulder stretches,' as explicitly stated in both the title and tags, making 'Stretching' the most fitting category with a high confidence score of 0.9. The description details a 'guided home stretching exercise routine' aimed at easing neck and shoulder pain, further reinforcing this classification.\n\nThere is mention of 'deep breathing exercises' both at the start and the conclusion of the routine, which aligns with the 'Breathing exercises' category, albeit with a lesser emphasis. Given the structured breathing elements, this warrants a score of 0.6.\n\nThe video is also described as suitable for 'beginners and intermediate level,' and comments praise the effectiveness of the routine for easing stiffness and improving mobility, supporting the choice of the 'Stretching' category. There are no indications of other workout types such as strength training or cardio, ruling out categories like 'Body weight' or 'HIIT.' The routine predominantly targets flexibility and relaxation, substantiating the primary categorization."
