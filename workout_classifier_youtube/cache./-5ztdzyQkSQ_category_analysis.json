  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Weight workout' with a score of 0.9. This is supported by the title '30-Minute Full-Body Strength-Training Workout With Weights' and the description, which explicitly mentions using 'a pair of medium weights, anywhere from 8 to 20 pounds' for exercises like 'tempo squats, single-leg deadlifts, and skaters.' The focus on strength-training circuits further emphasizes the use of weights. \n\nThe 'Body weight' category is included with a score of 0.5. Although the main focus is on weights, bodyweight exercises could be a component as implied by terms like 'full-body strength-training' and 'exercise that pushes me' in the comments, suggesting some bodyweight involvement, though not the primary focus. \n\nThe 'Other' category is assigned a minor score of 0.2 due to potential inclusion of non-traditional strength elements or the varied nature of the workout channel's content, which might incorporate a broader fitness approach. The channel's extensive offering of diverse fitness topics suggests the workout might include elements beyond strict weight training. The confidence rating of 0.85 reflects the strong evidence from the title and description, combined with contextual comments supporting the main conclusion."
