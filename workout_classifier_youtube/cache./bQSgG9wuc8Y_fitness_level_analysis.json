  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves a variety of exercises that include unilateral movements like the kickstand squat and Romanian deadlift, which require coordination and balance. The use of dumbbells for exercises such as renegade rows, alternating snatches, and dead bugs with dumbbells adds a moderate level of complexity, indicating an intermediate level of technique. However, the inclusion of more complex exercises like the unilateral hold and curl, and alternating snatch, which require synchronized movement patterns, suggests some aspects of advanced technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 40-minute duration, with work periods of 60 seconds and only 20 seconds rest between exercises, creates a high overall physical demand. This structure aligns with a Challenging effort difficulty, especially given the workout's focus on strength and energy-intensive compound movements. The limited rest and inclusion of complex movements like snatches and renegade rows slightly verge into Extreme effort due to high cardiovascular demands and energy expenditure, though primarily it's a solid Challenging workout.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the intermediate and some advanced techniques involved and the challenging to slightly extreme effort difficulty, the required fitness level is primarily Intermediate. The option for users to select their dumbbell weights allows for personal modification, making it accessible to motivated beginners seeking an intermediate challenge. The workout's duration of 40 minutes and the compound exercises aim it towards those with some exercise experience, while the advanced rating accounts for the technical aspects seen in some movement patterns."
