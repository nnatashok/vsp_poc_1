  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Yoga' with a score of 1.0 as the title 'Yoga For Hands, Fingers, Wrists | 11-Minute Yoga Quickie' explicitly refers to yoga. The description emphasizes a targeted therapeutic sequence aimed at reducing inflammation and improving flexibility, which aligns closely with yoga practices. The channel name 'Yoga With Adriene' and tags like 'yoga for wrists', 'yoga for fingers', and 'yoga at home' further reinforce this classification, indicating a strong focus on yoga.\n\n'Stretching' is also relevant with a score of 0.5. Although the focus is on yoga, the video description and comments suggest exercises to increase range of motion and flexibility, especially in wrists and fingers, which overlaps with stretching activities. The phrase 'improve flexibility in the small muscles of the hands, fingers, and forearms' in the description supports this secondary categorization.\n\nThe observed focus on carpal tunnel syndrome relief and comments from users confirming its therapeutic benefits further validate these classifications. No other categories are pertinent due to the specific focus on yoga and stretching practices."
