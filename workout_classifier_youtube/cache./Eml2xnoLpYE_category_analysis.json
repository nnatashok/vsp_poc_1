  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Yoga' with a high score of 0.9, as the title and tags explicitly mention 'yoga' multiple times, suggesting a focus on yoga practice. The description and tags further emphasize this with terms like 'full body flow,' 'yoga workout,' 'yoga stretch,' 'yoga flow,' and 'power yoga,' which strongly point towards yoga as the central theme of the video. \n\n'Stretching' is the secondary category with a score of 0.7, indicated by the repeated reference to 'mobility,' 'stretch workout,' and 'yoga stretch' in the tags and description. These elements suggest that stretching is a significant component of the workout.\n\n'Body weight' is considered with a moderate score of 0.5 because the workout is described as using 'no equipment,' and tags like 'bodyweight workout' and 'strength training' imply exercising with only body resistance, typical for body weight workouts.\n\nOverall, the confidence level in these classifications is high due to the strong presence of specific keywords and repeated emphasis on yoga and stretching throughout the metadata."
