  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled 'You Are Life Itself \u2014 Guided Meditation with Mooji' primarily suggests a meditation-focused session, which aligns strongly with vibes of 'The Zen Flow'. This vibe is characterized by grounding, intentional, and breath-centered qualities, supported by words in the description such as 'guided meditation', 'space of pure being', and 'be confirmed in your completeness'. The use of terms like 'Satsang', 'Self-realization', and 'awareness' in both the description and tags further emphasize a meditative, introspective session. Hence, a score of 0.95 is assigned to 'The Zen Flow' due to its strong embodiment of these elements.\n\nAdditionally, the video also fits 'The Deep Recharge' vibe, which involves nervous system reset and gentle movement, due to the calming and deeply relaxing nature of Mooji's guided meditations and the emphasis on inner peace and liberation. The tags and description imply spiritual and introspective reflection which supports this vibe, although to a slightly lesser extent, resulting in a score of 0.75. Other potential vibes like 'The Reboot Workout' and 'The Comfort Moves' were considered but excluded due to the focus on spiritual guidance and meditation over physical movement or active recovery."
