  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout focuses on core exercises that are likely to include basic movements such as crunches or planks, suitable for most beginners. However, there may be some slightly more complex movements requiring body awareness typically considered intermediate, as suggested by tags like 'toned core workout.' The absence of equipment further supports a Beginner classification, though varying complexity of core exercises can push certain elements into the Intermediate range.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the 10-minute duration and core-focused nature, the effort level is likely in the Light to Moderate range. The workout is short, suggesting low overall energy expenditure, yet core workouts can engage muscles significantly, especially with minimal rest, slightly increasing the effort required. The description and tags provide no indication of high intensity but mention usability for a daily routine, reinforcing a lower effort classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "With a focus on core exercises without equipment, the video is broadly accessible to beginners. Comments imply enjoyment and accessibility, and the description's encouragement for daily incorporation suggests it suits regular users, including less fit individuals. The consideration of Intermediate level accounts for users needing more core conditioning challenge, as the short duration and accessible movements are available to a broad fitness spectrum."
