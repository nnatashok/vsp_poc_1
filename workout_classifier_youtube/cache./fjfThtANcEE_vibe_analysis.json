  "vibesExplanation": "The title \"15 MIN DAILY STRETCH (full body) - for tight muscles, mobility & flexibility\" immediately suggests a focus on relaxation and flexibility rather than intense physical exertion, aligning with vibes like 'The Zen Flow' and 'The Reboot Workout'. The description emphasizes it being a \"quick, relaxing, full body stretch,\" ideal for morning or bedtime, indicative of 'The Zen Flow' with its grounding, unhurried, and breath-centered approach. This vibe is strongly supported by the descriptors \"relaxing\" and the suitability \"before bed.\" \n\nThe Reboot Workout vibe is suggested by references to \"mobility\" and \"working on flexibility,\" and the commenters\u2019 appreciation for its soul-refreshing nature. The comment about it being a \"masterpiece for the soul\" underscores this rejuvenating aspect, resonating with 'The Reboot Workout'. \n\nThe emphasis on gentle stretching routines to improve mobility aligns more with a calming and restorative vibe rather than high intensity. Other potential vibes that focus on intensity, such as 'The Warrior Workout,' were excluded due to the video's relaxing and stretching focus."
