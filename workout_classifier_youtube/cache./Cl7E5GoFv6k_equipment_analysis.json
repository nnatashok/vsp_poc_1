The description specifies the use of dumbbells ranging from 2 to 10 pounds, with alternatives such as water bottles or cans suggested if dumbbells are unavailable. However, the primary equipment preferred is dumbbells, which is essential for exercises like the shoulder press, tricep extension, bicep curl, and probably others mentioned in the workout, providing a high confidence score of 0.9 that dumbbells are needed for this workout."
