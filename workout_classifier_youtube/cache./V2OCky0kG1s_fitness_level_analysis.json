  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'low impact' cardio routine suitable for beginners, which suggests simple movements. Terms like 'walking exercise' imply straight-forward movements typical for a beginner level. The use of 'low impact' and 'beginner' in both the title and tags supports the beginner technique level, possibly extending to intermediate due to some coordination possibly required for effective cardio routines.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is 11:35, which is short and suggests a lighter or moderate effort level. Keywords like 'no jumping' and 'low impact' indicate the workout is not highly intense, supporting a 'Light' to 'Moderate' effort difficulty. Comments describing it as 'nice, short and simple', and feedback from a pregnant viewer suggesting it is accessible further support this classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the 'low impact' description and focus on beginners, this workout primarily suits a Beginner level. However, the potential for Intermediate classification exists due to intermediate movers being mentioned. The mix of beginner-friendly tags and the mention of walking as an exercise suggest introductory but scalable challenges, making it accessible for both novice and slightly more experienced users."
