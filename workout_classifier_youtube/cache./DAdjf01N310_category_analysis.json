  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as 'Pilates' with a score of 1 due to strong evidence from multiple metadata sources. The title clearly states 'Pilates' and the description reinforces this with phrases like '20 Minute Morning Pilates class.' The channel, 'Move With Nicole,' is known for Pilates content, as indicated by the metadata and channel description. Tags such as 'morning pilates,' 'full body pilates workout,' and 'at home pilates workout no equipment' also confirm this categorization.\n\nThe secondary category 'Mat' is assigned a score of 0.8 since the workout is performed on a mat, as evidenced by the description and tags like 'at home pilates workout no equipment.' The video description and comments suggest that the exercises involve floor movements typical of mat workouts.\n\nDespite potential overlap with 'Body weight,' this category was not chosen due to the explicit emphasis on Pilates methodology rather than general strength training. The high confidence level of 0.95 reflects the consistency and clarity of the Pilates focus across all metadata."
