  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Yoga' with a score of 0.9, based on explicit mentions in the title, tags, and description like \"chair yoga,\" \"seated yoga,\" and specific references to yoga practices in comments. Yoga is also supported by the channel\u2019s focus on exercises suitable for seniors and beginners, which aligns with yoga's adaptability for diverse fitness levels. 'Stretching' is assigned with a score of 0.7 as the video focuses on gentle stretches for various muscle groups, mentioned in the description (e.g., stretching shoulders, chest, triceps, etc.). The gentle, seated nature of the workout excludes more vigorous exercise categories like HIIT or traditional mat workouts. No other categories are strongly applicable due to the low-intensity and specific focus on yoga and stretching."
