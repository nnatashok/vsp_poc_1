  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is marketed as 'pregnancy safe' for early trimesters, suggesting it suits beginners with allowances for multiple fitness levels. Its 30-minute duration shifts the target audience slightly to include more fit beginners and intermediates, reflected in the scores: 'Beginner' 0.6 and 'Intermediate' 0.7. Advanced scores 0.4 due to potential for scaling efforts as noted by comments and descriptors like 'intense' and 'challenging', but it's not likely widely accessible at this level given the prenatal focus."
