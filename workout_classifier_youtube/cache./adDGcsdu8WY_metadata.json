    "\u200fHello again, after two months I am happy with my results today, my weight two months ago is 90 kg and today my weight is 80 kg \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\u060c also I have lost fat and my body has become better, I bought new clothes because my old clothes are getting too big \ud83d\ude02\u060c  and this is a great feeling .. I followed the exercises in this channel and also only intermittent fasting ,  I stayed away from fast food...just this is my weight loss routine. Thank you to everyone who waited for my results and thank you Oliver for helping us. I am grateful and And I will continue to lose more weight, and I apologize if my English is not good, but I wanted to share with you the results, thanks again \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
    "Hey Oliver, I commented on your older 15-minute HIIT video and since that comment I&#39;ve achieved my goal of breakthing through my plateau. I&#39;ve since managed to keep 7 lbs off using that HIIT routine and I&#39;ve now decided to move on to a 20 minute one. I owe you so much!",
    "no intro or introduction or anything, just straight to the point, well i have to say that we don&#39;t see this often especially here on YouTube, i salute you sir",
