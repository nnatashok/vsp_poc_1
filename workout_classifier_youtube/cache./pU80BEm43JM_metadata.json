    "my daughters derelization has been affecting her lately, she has ptsd from a past episode she had and she has been struggling very badly, she\u2019s 13 years old. I\u2019ve been pushing her to try to be stronger for herself and giving her all of the support she needs, and I\u2019ve realized meditation has helped her so much. It completely masks her anxiety, and she\u2019s able to feel at ease even if It\u2019s for 5 minutes, I\u2019m so grateful to have people like us in the comments to know that we are not alone. I pray my daughter will realize she isn\u2019t either, and that this anxiety is curable.",
    "The fact that you have a clock in the background aduibly ticking is brilliant. I dont know if it was on purpose or not but it gives the person listening something real to focus on while you&#39;re talking, in case we cant hear anything where we are.",
    "Anxiety is like a weight on your shoulder and never goes away never stops being heavy but with meditation and patience anything can happen I&#39;ve learned to accept my feelings me fears and let go and find some sort of of peace within myself and meditation and mindfulness has had a huge part in helping with that. I wish anyone reading this to have some peace and love and tranquility bestowed upon you and just know that you are okay and everything is gonna be okay and  god loves you and so do I",
    "My Mom has been causing a lot of anxiety for my wife and I. Stomach feels knotted, it feels like there&#39;s a beehive in my chest causing me to think and feel at 100mph. This is helping me to slow down and get some control over my body again. Thank you"
