  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for the video \"Full Body Total Beginner Workout\" by \"growwithjo\" indicates that this is a bodyweight workout designed for beginners. The title, description, and tags all emphasize that the workout is suitable for beginners and does not require equipment. Specifically, the description states: \"without the need for equipment,\" which clearly indicates that no equipment is necessary to perform the workout. The tags such as \"bodyweight workout\" and \"all standing workouts\" further imply that the exercises rely on bodyweight movements, and user comments do not provide any evidence of equipment use. Thus, the workout appears to be designed to be performed without any additional equipment."
