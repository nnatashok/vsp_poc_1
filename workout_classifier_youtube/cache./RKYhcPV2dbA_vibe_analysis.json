  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled '7 ESSENTIAL STRETCHES YOU NEED TO DO DAILY!' clearly aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe due to its focus on stretching, flexibility, and mobility. The video is described as a daily full-body stretch routine requiring no equipment, emphasizing rejuvenation and a low-stress total-body refresh, warranting a score of 0.9 for this vibe. The repetitive and foundational nature of stretches, as noted in both the title and comments, also aligns with 'The Foundation Builder' vibe, scoring it a 0.7. It aids in improving posture, reducing injury risk, and enhancing flexibility, as evidenced by viewer testimonials about long-term improvements. Moreover, comments suggest it\u2019s suitable for various fitness levels and promotes a feel-good experience, hence fitting 'The Comfort Moves' with a score of 0.6. While 'The Zen Flow' could have been considered, the quicker pace and less introspective focus differentiate this workout from such breath-centered practices."
