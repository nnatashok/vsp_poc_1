    "Whenever I do meditation, I only able to listen to almost half of it, next half I will be sleeping... Till date couldn&#39;t complete any. I am really thankful for the meditation sessions. I came out of anxiety in a month without any medication...  \ud83d\ude0a",
    "Met an amazing soul online, Dr Ashwin. He introduced me to this meditation 3 weeks ago. We started doing this together even if I complain that I don&#39;t like doing, he still manages to get it done by me. Today 7 Aug 2023, he is busy somewhere, we couldn&#39;t have our session, however how could I allow myself to disrespect this man and not follow what he showed me? So I did it alone. Thanks for everything, Ashwin! \ud83d\ude4f<br>If the days won\u2019t allow us to see each other, memories will, and if my eyes can\u2019t see you, my heart will never forget you...Stay Blessed always to the best male figure a female could ever have in her life. <br>\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\uddff\ud83c\udf38\u2728\ufe0f",
    "the state of relaxation releases the stiffness in the body...the headache goes away...thank you Guruji...you are God...\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\udc9a\ud83c\udf3f\ud83c\udf10",
    "Somehow my eyes welled up with tears but my face was lit up with smile.Tears trickled down but heart was calm and peaceful."
