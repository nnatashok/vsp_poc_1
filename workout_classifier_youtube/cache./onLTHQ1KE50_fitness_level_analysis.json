  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for this workout is primarily \"Beginner\" with a score of 0.8 due to the straightforward and simple nature of standing dumbbell exercises for arms (biceps, triceps, shoulders). The description and tags indicate no complex movements such as pushups or planks, and the comments suggest accessibility with users of varying ages and fitness levels, including a 67-year-old woman incorporating it daily. The use of dumbbells requires basic form awareness, which gives a weighted score to \"Intermediate\" at 0.4. The movements involved do not require advanced technique, thus suggesting high suitability for beginners with some potential fit for intermediates.",
