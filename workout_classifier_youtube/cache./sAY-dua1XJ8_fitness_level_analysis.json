  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves using an elliptical machine, which is relatively simple for beginners to master, as it primarily involves steady movements. The recommendation to increase resistance or incline adds slight complexity, possibly elevating to an intermediate level. Additionally, the presence of both upper and lower body engagement requires some coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'insane' and involves HIIT principles, indicating a significant energy expenditure. The duration is just under 20 minutes, and with HIIT style (6 rounds of 30 seconds high intensity, 90 seconds low intensity), it becomes moderately challenging. The brief description of pushing 'as hard as you can' during the workout also highlights the demanding effort required.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "While the technique difficulty remains primarily accessible, the HIIT format raises the effort difficulty to a more challenging level. Beginners with some experience may attempt it, but the workout's structure and intensity require the user to handle quick pace changes and the incline/resistance adjustments, suggesting strong suitability for intermediate users. Advanced users can benefit by adjusting intensity through resistance and pace. Beginners can start at a lower intensity, but may find it demanding."
