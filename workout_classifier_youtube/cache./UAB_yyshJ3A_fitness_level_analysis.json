  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is predominantly Beginner because the title and metadata emphasize guided breathing and the Wim Hof Method, which generally consists of simple breathing exercises requiring minimal coordination or specialized skill. Breathing exercises typically do not involve complex movements, thus making them accessible to those at the beginner level. However, a slight Intermediate component is considered due to the importance of mindful focus and control as noted in the comments, which may require a degree of body awareness more typical of intermediate exercises.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Effort difficulty is classified as Light because the workout's main activity involves controlled breathing. Such exercises have low physical demands compared to typical workouts. Although breathing exercises can be mentally and energetically engaging, they do not carry the high energy expenditure associated with physical exercises like HIIT or weightlifting. The session duration of 20 minutes and the comments suggest participants feel rejuvenated rather than physically exhausted.",
