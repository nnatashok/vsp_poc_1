  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout primarily consists of basic stretching exercises such as the 'Seated Figure Four', 'Butterfly Stretch', and 'Cobra', which are fundamental and require minimal coordination. These movements require minimal skill, fitting well with a Beginner level for technique difficulty. However, some stretches like 'Double Pigeon' and 'Pigeon Stretch' may require slightly more attention to form and flexibility, justifying a slight consideration for the Intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 20-minute full-body stretch focusing on flexibility and not on cardiovascular or muscle endurance, leading to a Light effort difficulty rating. There are no high-intensity movements or complex sequences, and the stretching routine is designed to be gentle and relaxing, suitable for all levels, especially complete beginners. The inclusion of deeper stretches may have a minimal impact on making it slightly Moderate for some less conditioned users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the Beginner technique difficulty and Light effort difficulty, the workout is highly suitable for Beginners, requiring minimal prior experience or fitness base. The workout could also marginally fit an Intermediate level for those looking to improve flexibility or use as a recovery session, but the primary audience would be Beginners due to the simple and gentle nature of stretching exercises, as indicated by the workout's focus on feeling good rather than pushing physical limits."
