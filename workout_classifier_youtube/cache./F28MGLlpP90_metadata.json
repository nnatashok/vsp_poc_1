    "Just give it your best effort. I liked this. At first I was upset cause I was trying to do it perfectly but instead of giving up I just did it my way to an extent. What I mean is I stopped counting after a minute and just did what felt like 4 seconds inhaling/5 seconds exhaling. Before I new it I was more relaxed then when I started.
