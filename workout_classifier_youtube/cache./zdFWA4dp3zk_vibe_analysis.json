  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled \"15 Minute Energy Cleanse (Guided Meditation)\" strongly embodies the vibe of \"The Zen Flow.\" This classification is supported by the focus on grounding and intentional breath-centered meditation, as mentioned in the description, which emphasizes releasing negativity and restoring balance. The use of phrases like \"let go of stagnant energy\" and \"create space for renewed vitality\" align with the grounding and breath-centered experience characteristic of \"The Zen Flow.\"\n\nAdditionally, the workout exhibits characteristics of \"The Deep Recharge\" vibe, which is about resetting the nervous system through gentle, mindful movement and breathing. The emphasis on stress and anxiety relief through \"gentle visualization and intentional breathing\" directly supports the restorative qualities central to \"The Deep Recharge.\"\n\nThe channel's emphasis on guided meditations and the original, calming background audio further support these classifications. User comments about cleansing and finding peace further bolster the selection of vibes, specifically highlighting the meditative aspect. Some ambiguity lies in whether it could fit into \"The Sleep Prep,\" but the morning focus makes \"The Zen Flow\" and \"The Deep Recharge\" more apt."
