  "categoriesExplanation": "The video 'Cardio Workout At Home - 30 Min Aerobic Exercise' by Roberta's Gym is classified under 'Mat' with a high confidence level. The title and description emphasize a cardio workout meant to be performed at home, which suggests a mat-based exercise as there is no mention of equipment. The tags such as 'home cardio', 'aerobic exercise', and 'cardio routine' align with mat exercises as they typically involve body movements without gym equipment. Additionally, the channel description highlights 'body weight workouts and exercises,' further indicating that the workout likely involves exercises performed on a mat. Comments refer to it as suitable for all levels, which supports the identification of a mat workout designed for accessibility without equipment. Other categories such as 'HIIT' or 'Body weight' are excluded as there's no indication of high-intensity intervals or explicit strength-focused exercises."
