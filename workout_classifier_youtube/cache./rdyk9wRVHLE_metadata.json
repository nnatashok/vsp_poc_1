    "Love this, no time wasted with excessive talking!  Great! Love the preview of the next exercise....makes this so smooth! Great job!",
    "I&#39;ve done this twice now and I have to say it&#39;s grounding at the end of a workout and I feel wonderful when I&#39;m finished. So calming.",
    "I love that you show the next move and that there is an alarm letting know when to pass to the next move. In that way, we don\u2019t have to break our neck to look at the screen while doing a pose, it\u2019s flown and very pleasant. Did this one after a cardio workout and it was super relaxing.",
    "This 52 yr old needed that.  I\u2019m just getting back to working out and not doing a good job of stretching.  So thank you for doing this, it was a great start to my day!",
