  "vibesExplanation": "The primary workout vibe for this video is 'The Zen Flow,' which matches the video's focus on breath-centered, grounding practices aimed at releasing tension in the hips and lower back. This is supported by phrases like 'go inward,' 'cultivate balance,' 'stability,' and 'release.' The gentle, unhurried nature of yoga practices, especially when designed to aid in pain relief and flexibility, aligns strongly with the Zen Flow vibe, justifying a high score of 0.9.\n\nSecondly, 'The Reboot Workout' is also a strong fit, as the video is designed to refresh the body by relieving hip and lower back pain. This is reinforced by the tags 'yoga for back pain,' and 'yoga for hip pain.' The gentle stretch and release qualities described in the metadata support a score of 0.7 for this vibe.\n\nComments and the channel's focus on providing accessible, feel-good, and supportive practices contribute further to these vibe classifications, making other potential vibes like 'The Groove Session' or 'The Meditative Grind' less applicable here."
