  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.75,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated as 'Intermediate' due to the nature of cycling, which involves maintaining proper posture, cycling technique, and rhythm. The workout is done on a turbo trainer or static bike, which adds a level of stability but requires coordination and endurance. The tags and description imply hill climbing simulation, which increases the complexity. 'Advanced' is included to capture the higher coordination needed for tackling simulated hill climbs, which require more engaged muscle groups and focus.",

    }
  ],
  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as 'Challenging' based on the 35-minute duration and the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format. The description indicates a significant demand on cardiovascular fitness and the quote 'If you're not sweating buckets at the end, you're not doing it right!' suggests high energy expenditure. Comments describe the workout as 'intense' and 'brutal,' reinforcing its challenging nature.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is determined to be 'Intermediate' with a strong score due to the combination of intermediate technique difficulty and challenging effort. The workout is an indoor cycle training session meant for improving endurance, suitable for those with some cycling experience or regular fitness training. 'Advanced' is also applicable given the demand mentioned in the comments and the hill training aspect, which requires more developed cardiovascular and muscular endurance. Beginners are less likely suitable due to duration and effort, reflected in a zero beginner score."
