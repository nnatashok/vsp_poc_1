  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is a 17-minute guided meditation aimed at reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation. Meditation is generally low in physical energy expenditure since it mainly involves mental focus and breathing rather than physical exertion. Hence, it is classified as 'Light' in effort difficulty, suitable for all fitness levels, especially beginners and those looking for very low-impact activities.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the beginner-level technique and light effort required, the primary required fitness level is 'Beginner.' Meditation does not require any baseline physical fitness, making it accessible to all individuals, including those in poor physical shape. 'Intermediate' is also included with moderate alignment to ensure coverage for those who might use meditation as a part of a broader wellness practice (though technical or effort-based restrictions are minimal). This aligns with the encouragement to approach self-care and mindfulness practices even from a less fit baseline."
