  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is assigned a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a very high confidence score of 0.9. This is primarily due to its focus on pregnancy, aiming to provide exercises that increase energy and relieve nausea from morning sickness, as mentioned in the description. The emphasis on safe modifications and overall careful approach aligns with a restorative and healing focus, further supported by user comments expressing feelings of calmness and strength post-workout.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also applicable with a high score of 0.7, given the methodical approach to tailoring exercises for a specific demographic (pregnant women in their first trimester). The channel's integration of various supportive resources, playlists, and structured programs for pregnancy also reinforces this classification.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' do not apply due to the workout's gentle intensity and focus on safety, which is not conducive to high-energy exertion. There are no indicators for 'Outdoor & Adventure', 'Sport & Agility', or 'Flow & Rhythm' based on the content described."
