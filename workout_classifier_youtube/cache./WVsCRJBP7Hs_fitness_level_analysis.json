The description emphasizes the accessibility of the stretches, indicating a basic level of complexity.

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Although the workout involves yoga, which can require some body awareness, the focus on full-body stretches for tension and sore muscles suggests a workout suitable for absolute beginners. Yoga's integration of balance and light coordination may raise the required level slightly for total novices, fitting a low-end intermediate rating. The 15-minute duration supports beginner accessibility but intermediate users might also find it beneficial. The multiple levels assignment considers users can vary intensity based on depth of pose engagement."
