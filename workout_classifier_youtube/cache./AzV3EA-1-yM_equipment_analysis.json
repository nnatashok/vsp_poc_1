  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video description explicitly mentions that Circuit 3 involves the use of dumbbells. The description also provides an alternative using filled water bottles if dumbbells are not available, which implies that dumbbells are a key component for the exercises in that part of the workout. The inclusion of different weights of dumbbells in the product links further emphasizes their use. The confidence is set to 0.8 as the dumbbells are central to the exercises in Circuit 3, although beginners are provided with an alternative."
