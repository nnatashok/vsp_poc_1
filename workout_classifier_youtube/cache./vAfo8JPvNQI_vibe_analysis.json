  "vibesExplanation": "The assigned vibe 'The Zen Flow' was chosen based on the video's strong emphasis on meditation, calmness, and intentionality. The title mentions 'Guided Meditation for Mornings' and focuses on 'clearing negativity' and 'opening chakras', which are elements of grounding and breath-centered practices aligned with the Zen Flow. This is further supported by the description that encourages a 'mindfulness meditation approach' and phrases like 'calm clarity' and 'vital health and replenishment', leading to a high confidence score of 0.95.\n\n' The Deep Recharge' vibe fits due to the video's setting as a morning ritual aimed at restoring energy and clarity, with its description mentioning 'vital health' and 'replenishment'. Comments from users discussing personal transformation and finding comfort also suggest an experience of gentle restoration, warranting a moderate score of 0.65.\n\nFinally, 'The Reboot Workout' was considered with a lower confidence score of 0.4, as the session functions to refresh the mind and spirit for the day. However, its physical workout aspect is minimal, focusing more on mental rejuvenation, hence it's a weaker match."
