  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Replace Treadmill With This 10 Min HIIT/CARDIO Workout' explicitly mentions in the tags and description that no equipment is required, highlighting phrases like 'No Equipment Needed' and 'No Weights? No Problem!'. This indicates that the workout is designed to be performed with bodyweight only, making it accessible and fitting the theme of calisthenics. The channel is known for offering workout routines that build muscle and burn fat without traditional gym equipment, supporting the notion that this workout requires no additional equipment beyond the participant's own bodyweight."
