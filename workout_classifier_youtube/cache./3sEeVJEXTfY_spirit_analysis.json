  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout primarily aligns with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit due to its methodical format, involving a sequence of exercises performed with specific times, as seen in the description which lists exercises like jumping jacks, body squats, and push-ups. This structured format, along with scheduled rest intervals, justifies a strong score of 0.65. The 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is supported by the use of terms like 'sweat,' 'burn fat,' and 'intense' from the tags, as well as comments praising its ability to motivate and provide results, leading to a score of 0.6. The 'Flow & Rhythm' is also present to a notable degree due to the continuous movement between exercises without equipment, and the emphasis on doing the routine as a morning wake-up energizer, deserving a score of 0.5. Other spirits, like 'Soothing & Restorative,' were excluded as the focus isn't on relaxation."
