  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a guided breathwork session aimed at promoting calm and restful sleep, as indicated by the title, description, and tags such as 'sleepmeditation,' 'breathwork,' and 'relaxation.' The focus is on breathing techniques and meditation for relaxation purposes, with no mention of any physical exercises or specific equipment. The description clearly emphasizes breathwork to 'activate the parasympathetic nervous system' and encourage relaxation, with the primary components being guided voice and calming music. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, requiring no additional equipment. This conclusion is further supported by user comments that praise the video for its calming effects without reference to needing any equipment."
