    "I just finished a year of Chemotherapy, Radiation and Immunotherapy and I needed to follow a program at home that would help me get back slowly.  I googled Chair Yoga and Chair Pilates and you popped up. I am so happy to have found you and your gifted way to teach yoga and pilates.",
    "I\u2019m very thankful for the variety your videos provide, from easy to more challenging workouts. This fits my needs and my abilities."
