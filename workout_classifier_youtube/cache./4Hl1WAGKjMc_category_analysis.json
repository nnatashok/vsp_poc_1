  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under 'Indoor biking' with high confidence (0.9 score) due to explicit mentions of 'indoor cycle training,' 'static bike,' 'exercise bike,' and specific cycling-related tags like 'Road Bike' and 'bike.' This aligns with the channel's focus on cycling, as seen in the channel description and tags, highlighting its emphasis on stationary cycling and related events. Additionally, the video is identified as 'HIIT' with moderate confidence (0.7 score), indicated by the description stating, 'this 20 minute HIIT session,' suggesting a structured alternation of intensity levels typical of high-intensity interval training. The presence of both terms in the description supports this classification. Although the workout primarily involves a cycling setup, the 'HIIT' label is reinforced by the specific duration targets and intensity indicated in the description. Other categories like 'Mat' or 'Body weight' were excluded due to lack of mention of floor exercises or resistance training elements in the provided metadata."
