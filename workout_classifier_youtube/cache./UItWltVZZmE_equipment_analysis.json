  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is explicitly described as not requiring any equipment, as indicated by the title \"No Equipment\" and reinforced in the description that states \"No Equipment necessary and not much space needed.\" The tags such as \"no equipment,\" \"no weight,\" and \"bodyweight\" further affirm that the exercises are bodyweight only. User comments do not indicate the need for any equipment either. Therefore, it is clear that this beginner-friendly, full-body workout relies solely on bodyweight exercises, and no additional equipment is needed. This results in a very high confidence score that no equipment is required for this workout."
