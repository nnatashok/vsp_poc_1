  "channelDescription": "Our mission is to make the world healthier and happier through the super power of calm. \n\nThere are lots of benefits to meditation, such as decreasing anxiety, worry and stress.\n\nIt enhances self-awareness, self-acceptance and patience. And it strengthens our resilience amidst uncertainty and adversity. Who wouldn\u2019t benefit from a little bit of that?\n \nCalm is all about mindfulness, the practice of paying attention to our thoughts, emotions and experiences without judgement.\n\nWhen we\u2019re able to maintain moment-to-moment awareness, we can make the choices that best serve us in life. If you\u2019re like us, you were drawn to mindfulness and meditation to live a happier, more peaceful, authentic life.",
