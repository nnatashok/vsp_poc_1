  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video focuses on a 'Lymph Cleansing Breathing Exercise,' as indicated in the title and throughout the video description. The primary activity described is a specific breathing pattern (4 seconds inhale, 16 seconds hold, 8 seconds exhale) to stimulate lymph flow, with no mention of any physical exercises that would typically require equipment. The tags such as 'breathwork,' 'yoga breathing,' and 'lymphatic breathing technique' reinforce that this is a purely breath-focused session. There is no mention of yoga mats, resistance bands, or any other physical equipment in the description, comments, or channel information. This suggests the exercise is designed to be performed without any additional equipment, likely in a standing or seated position that requires no support or cushioning from a mat or chair. Therefore, after evaluating the provided metadata, it appears that no equipment is needed for this workout."
