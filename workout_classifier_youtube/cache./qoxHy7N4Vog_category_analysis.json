  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Pilates' with a score of 1.0 due to the explicit mention in the title ('40 MIN CARDIO PILATES') and throughout the tags and description ('pilates workout', 'full body pilates', 'cardio pilates workout'). The video is strongly focused on Pilates as it combines Pilates principles with athletic cardio flows, which is further confirmed by the channel's emphasis on Pilates and the creator's background as a certified Pilates instructor.\n\nThe secondary category 'Mat' is assigned a score of 0.6. This is supported by the exercise being performed using a mat, as noted in the description's mention of 'Mat from Liforme' and from the content style where Pilates exercises are typically floor-based. Additionally, 'full body workout' and 'at-home pilates' imply exercises done on a mat.\n\nThis categorization excludes HIIT or Weight Workout despite the references to cardio and fat burning, as the primary exercise method remains Pilates and there is no indication of high-intensity intervals or use of weights."
