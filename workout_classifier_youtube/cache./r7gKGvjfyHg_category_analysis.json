  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is aptly classified as a 'Mat' workout because the exercises detailed in the description are performed on an exercise mat and include movements like crunches, planks, and sit-ups. The title 'NO EQUIPMENT' and the repetition of exercises such as 'TABLE TOP CRUNCH' and 'SIDE PLANK OBLIQUE LIFTS' confirm this categorization. The score of 0.8 reflects the strong presence of mat-based exercises.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Body weight' category is suitable as all exercises are performed without any external weights or resistance, relying solely on the individual's body weight for resistance. The description and tags like 'no equipment workout' and 'home workout' emphasize the body weight nature, supporting a score of 0.7.\n\nOther potential categories like 'Weight workout' or 'HIIT' were excluded since there is no indication of weighted equipment or interval-based intensity commonly associated with HIIT workouts. The consistent use of terms related to core strengthening and no mention of equipment further solidifies the chosen categories."
