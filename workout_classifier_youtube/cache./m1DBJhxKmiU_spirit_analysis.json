  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout aligns with multiple spirits due to its multifaceted nature. 'Flow & Rhythm' (0.7) is represented by the smooth, continuous movement of an 'all standing' and 'walking' routine, supported by tags like 'walking workouts' and 'fun fitness videos'. The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit (0.6) is supported by the 'low impact' nature, emphasizing 'energized' mornings without the intensity of high-impact exercise, suitable for 'beginners', and comments reflecting a gentle introduction to fitness for those easing into exercise. 'Structured & Disciplined' (0.6) is evident in the structured 20-minute routine that aims to boost metabolism and promote consistency as indicated by phrases like 'daily workout', 'routine', and viewer comments discussing progress and adherence to workouts. High-energy and intensity elements are absent, as the session is designed to be beginner-friendly and low impact, focusing more on routine establishment and gentle engagement than on pushing physical limits."
