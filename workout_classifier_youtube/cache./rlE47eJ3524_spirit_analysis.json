  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified as 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' based on several key indicators in the metadata. The title \"20-Minute Beginner Yoga Routine | Gentle Flow With Blocks\" and tags such as \"gentle yoga flow,\" \"slow yoga flow,\" and \"yoga for relaxation\" strongly suggest a focus on smooth, continuous movements and relaxation, aligning with a flow-based approach. The description highlights the use of breath in each pose and the supportive use of blocks, indicating a gentle pace and attention to alignment and flexibility, reinforcing the flow spirit with a score of 0.85. Meanwhile, the class's beginner-friendly nature, emphasis on ease, and relaxation, as evident from phrases like \"gentle, relaxing routine,\" justify a 'Soothing & Restorative' classification with a score of 0.8. The channel's focus on transformative practices like yoga and sound healing further supports these spirits. There is no evidence for 'High-Energy & Intense' or other activity-specific spirits like 'Sport & Agility' due to the workout's gentle nature and lack of performance or sport-specific elements."
