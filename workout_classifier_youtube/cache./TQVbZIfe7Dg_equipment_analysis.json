  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video content is centered around a guided meditation led by Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, as indicated by the title 'Inner Silence Guided Meditation' and confirmed by repeated use of terms like 'meditation,' 'guided meditation,' 'relaxation,' and 'healing' in both the description and tags. Meditation practices typically require no physical workout equipment. There are no mentions of any workout or fitness equipment across the metadata. Meditation is generally a seated practice done with minimal to no equipment. Based on these considerations, it is clear that this video does not require any equipment, reflecting a bodyweight-only practice of mental and spiritual focus. Therefore, the classification does not include any items from the equipment options list."
