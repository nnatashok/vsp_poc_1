  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is primarily focused on pranayama, which is a form of controlled breathing exercises aimed at energy control, as evident from the title \"Daily Guided Pranayama for Inner Balance | 10 mins | Beginner Level\". This indicates a structure but also a deep focus on inner peace and balance, strongly aligning with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. Tags such as 'pranayama for inner peace', 'breathing exercises for relaxation', and 'pranayama for stress relief' further reinforce the emphasis on relaxation and stress reduction, which solidifies the main spirit as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.9 due to its strong restorative elements.\n\nThe video is also structured, given the guided nature of the practice and specific mention of balancing the Agya Chakra. This element of progressive practice and chakra balancing provides a linkage to the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, though less prominently, hence scored at 0.4. The channel's focus on methodical yoga practices also supports this classification, but the lack of technical precision or progressive intensity typical of purely structured routines limits the score.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the absence of intensity and sport-specific elements in the workout. The calm urban setting in Panjim city mentioned in the description does not contribute to an 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification."
