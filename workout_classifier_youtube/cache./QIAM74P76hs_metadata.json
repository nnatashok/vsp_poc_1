    "Why do my legs hurt when I use the elliptical?",
    "good music is important so keep up the videos but use upbeat music\ud83d\ude00",
    "Thanks for posting this, My constructive criticism would be, to down a bit the music, and subtitle the exercise , minutes, intensity,  incline, the thing is sometimes the voice get lost and if we can read that wouldn&#39;t matter, and of course for people who can not hear at all.",
    "Was good but the music could be faster"
