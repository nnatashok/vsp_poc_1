  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Pilates' because the title, description, and tags clearly emphasize it as a Pilates workout. Phrases such as 'Full Body Pilates Workout for Beginners' and tags like 'pilates workout full body' and 'beginner pilates workout' strongly support this classification. The channel owner, Nicole, is also a certified Pilates instructor, further confirming the Pilates focus. A score of 0.9 reflects the very high confidence in this primary classification.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Mat' due to the mention of a mat in the description and comments indicating exercises performed lying or seated, which require a mat. The comments highlight the absence of equipment, aligning with mat-focused exercises. The score of 0.7 denotes a strong presence of elements common in mat workouts, though slightly less central than the Pilates aspect.\n\nOther categories like 'Yoga', 'Body weight', and 'Stretching' were considered but excluded, as the content explicitly focuses on Pilates and general mat work without significant emphasis on those elements."
