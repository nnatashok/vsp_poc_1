  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit for this workout is \"High-Energy & Intense,\" as evidenced by the title 'High Intensity' and the description detailing interval training with micro intervals and high effort levels (e.g., Effort level 9 and 10). These elements suggest a workout that is fast-paced, demanding, and designed to push limits - characteristics of a high-energy and intense spirit (score: 0.9).\n\nAdditionally, \"Structured & Disciplined\" is a strong match (score: 0.8). The session follows a clear protocol with detailed timing and effort levels for warm-ups, main intervals, and cool downs, reflecting methodical and progressive training structure.\n\nLastly, \"Sport & Agility\" is also relevant (score: 0.7), as the focus on cycling, micro intervals, and tempo sessions are tailored to improve sports-specific skills such as speed and endurance, essential for cycling performance. However, the lack of outdoor or sport-specific context reduces the score slightly.\n\nOther spirits like \"Soothing & Restorative,\" \"Flow & Rhythm,\" and \"Outdoor & Adventure\" were excluded due to the workout's indoor setting, structured intervals, and high-intensity focus."
