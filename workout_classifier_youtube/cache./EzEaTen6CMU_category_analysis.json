  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified under 'Indoor biking' with a very high confidence level due to clear indicators from multiple sources. The video title explicitly mentions 'Cycling Workout' and the description emphasizes that this is a 'warm up ride' specifically for cycling. The tags such as 'cycling workout', 'warm up routine', 'cardio workout' also reinforce this classification. Additionally, the channel's primary content focus is explicitly on spin classes and indoor cycling workouts, as mentioned in both the description and channel information. The specificity of the exercise type in the metadata aligns strongly with 'Indoor biking,' making other categories like 'Mat' or 'HIIT' irrelevant for this analysis."
