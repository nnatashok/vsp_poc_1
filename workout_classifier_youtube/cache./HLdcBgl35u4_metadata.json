    "Cindy, I have 74 years old. have done these exercises for quite a while and my body is changed. Thank you very much. \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc4b\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70",
    "I have just had a short break away I felt I needed it. I went to the Isle of Man as I had lived there many years ago and my late husband and I had had a couple of lovely holidays there.  I was apprehensive as how far I could walk but after my walking having improved so much with your various exercises, and I treated myself to a walking stick/seat, I thought I could manage.  One of the other ladies in our group I buddied up with had a step watch/counter.  The second day she made a point of checking for me and I did 10,000 steps.  I only sat down unofficially twice.  Once having walked up a bit of a steep hill with a not very stable surface.  In fact another couple waited for me half way up as they were worried about me but I made it just in time to collapse onto my seat haha.  This was much down to all your exercises really so thank you Cindy.  I had a lovely holiday and can definitely walk much further than I thought, maybe not quite 10,000 steps every day though, yet.  I did these strength exercises just now as haven&#39;t done any while away.  Sorry I have rambled on rather much \ud83d\ude42",
    "I like your workouts because you get to point, no long discussions and have a variety to choose from - thank you,",
    "I did your workout today.  I think your strength workout is awesome.  You worked all of the muscles in my 80 year old body.  Plan to do this workout 3 times a week.  Very easy to follow your video.",
    "Cindy, I have been doing the 15 minute senior muscle strength video with you almost every day for 9 months now and I feel great! I look better too, thank you so much for sharing your workouts!"
