  "categoriesExplanation": "The video titled 'Surrender Meditation | A Spoken guided visualization (Letting go of control)' is explicitly about meditation. The terms 'guided meditation,' 'guided visualization,' and 'letting go' in the title and tags strongly indicate meditation content, supporting a high score of 0.95 for the 'Meditation' category. The description and channel information also focus heavily on meditation, relaxation, and self-soothing practices, reinforcing this classification. \n\nAdditionally, considering the phrase 'letting go of control' in the context of meditation, there might be some brief focus on controlled breathing as part of the process, warranting a score of 0.3 for 'Breathing exercises'. However, the primary emphasis remains on guided meditation, as supported by the predominant use of meditation-related terms in the tags and the channel's thematic focus. Overall, the very high confidence of 0.95 reflects the consistent presentation of this as a meditation-focused content piece."
