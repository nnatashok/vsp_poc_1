  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is strongly classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a very high confidence score of 0.95. This is evident from the title's mention of 'HIIT', which stands for High-Intensity Interval Training, indicating fast-paced and demanding exercise. The description reiterates this by highlighting 'high intensity intervals' and preparing for 'intense physical challenge', further solidifying the high-energy focus. User comments such as 'challenging, high energy and high intensity session' and 'one of the best short workouts' reinforce this classification. \n\n' Structured & Disciplined' is also a fit with a score of 0.75, due to the methodical approach of using specific intervals typical in HIIT workouts, requiring technical precision as indicated by comments appreciating the structure ('I\u2019m a Spinning Master Instructor in NY, USA. This ride is brilliantly coached.'). The presence of indicators like RPM and the structured timing of intervals points to organized training sessions, aligning with this spirit. \n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are not relevant, as the focus is on intensity, rather than smoothness, relaxation, or recovery."
