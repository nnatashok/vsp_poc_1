  "vibesExplanation": "The selected workout video primarily aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe due to its focus on high-intensity, full-body exercises using moderately heavy dumbbells. The description emphasizes building strength and muscular definition through sequences like the Arnold press and Romanian deadlift, which are known to invoke a sense of vigorous, primal energy typical of Warrior workouts. The 20-minute format with limited rest and no repeats challenges endurance and strength, warranting a score of 0.7.\n\n'Progression Quest' is also fitting, scoring 0.6, as the routine encourages methodical improvement and strength gains. Users report repeated engagement over weeks to achieve visible results, which supports a structured, incremental development approach reminiscent of a progression vibe.\n\nFinally, 'The Masterclass Workout' receives a moderate score of 0.5 due to the focus on technique-driven exercises, like the Pallof press, and offering modifications, which adds an element of skill refinement and education, typical of a masterclass setting.\n\nThe choice to exclude vibes like 'The Zen Flow' was due to the session's emphasis on intensity and strength, which do not match the calm and unhurried nature of a Zen-centered workout."
