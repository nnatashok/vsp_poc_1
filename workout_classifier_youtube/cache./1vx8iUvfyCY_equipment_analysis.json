  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"Guided Meditation for Detachment From Over-Thinking (Anxiety / OCD / Depression)\" appears to be a guided meditation session rather than a physical workout. The metadata, including the title, description, and tags, highlights the focus on mindfulness meditation, relaxation, and dealing with anxiety, OCD, and depression through mental exercises and hypnosis techniques. There are no mentions of any physical equipment typically used for workouts or yoga.\n\nThe description emphasizes mental techniques such as calm awareness of the breath and detachment from rumination, without implying any physical activity that would require equipment. The video is categorized under relaxation and mental guidance, further supporting the classification that no equipment is needed.\n\nComments from viewers reflect personal experiences with mental changes and stress relief, reinforcing the idea that the session is purely for mental and emotional benefit. Thus, this video is purely bodyweight, in the metaphorical sense, as it relies solely on non-physical techniques for its intended outcomes."
