  "categoriesExplanation": "The video clearly falls within the 'Yoga' category with a very high confidence, as indicated by the title, tags, and description emphasizing 'Vinyasa yoga', 'yoga practice', and 'yoga flow'. Terms such as 'functional movement', 'full body yoga', and 'power yoga' suggest a holistic yoga practice, which is strongly supported by the channel's branding as a yoga-focused channel with certified instructors. The use of the term 'functional movement' and the channel's expertise in 'Functional Range Conditioning (FRC)' and 'mobility training' implies aspects of 'Stretching', which is given a moderate score. However, the primary focus is clearly on yoga, making it the dominant category. Thus, 'Yoga' is assigned a high score reflecting its centrality to the video's purpose."
