    "I haven&#39;t practiced in a hot minute. I&#39;ve been needing this medicine, though I was worried about coming back to the mat. I wrote in my journal &quot;it&#39;s easier to distract myself than try and practice gratitude and be with my mind and body this way&quot;. It&#39;s easier before coming on the mat. Funny thing  is, when I got to the mat and followed this practice, it was easier to practice the gratitude and being present. Thank you, Adriene. As always, you&#39;re wonderful and you have me coming back.",
    "Took yoga classes at an expensive gym for 17 years with an instructor that trained under Baron Baptiste.  For the past two years, I have switched to a home practice, and that is how I found Adriene.  My practice is now very internal, no mirrors, no comparing myself to others, no yoga instructor complimenting only those that excel.  Love going slowly, mindfully, and constantly paying attention to how my body feels in the moment.  Love going back to a beginners practice and finding something new in the basics.  Would not be without a home practice at this point, that is how important and beneficial it has been to me\u2014it also feels like therapy.  Thank you Adriene!",
    "Love the longer classes \u2764\ufe0f",
