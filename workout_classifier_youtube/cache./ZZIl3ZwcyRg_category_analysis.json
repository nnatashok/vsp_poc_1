  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is categorized primarily under 'Stretching' due to several indicators: the title explicitly states 'Full-Body Daily Stretch Routine' and the description frequently mentions 'stretches' to relieve pregnancy symptoms. Tags like 'pregnancy stretches' and 'best stretches for pregnancy' further emphasize this focus. The score of 0.8 is assigned based on this strong presence.\n\nA secondary category of 'Yoga' is considered due to the presence of tags such as 'prenatal yoga' and 'pregnancy yoga'. The inclusion of yoga indicates that some elements of yoga might be integrated into the routine. However, since the primary focus is on stretching, and the description does not detail specific yoga poses, a score of 0.6 is assigned for yoga, reflecting its supportive but not dominant role.\n\nOther categories were excluded as the video does not involve equipment, high intensity, or resistance training. The channel's focus on pregnancy fitness and stretching further supports these category selections."
