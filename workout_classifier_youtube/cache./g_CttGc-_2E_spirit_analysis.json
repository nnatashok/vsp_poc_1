  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this video is 'Structured & Disciplined,' with a strong score of 0.9. The video is explicitly designed as an 'Absolute Beginner Bodyweight Workout,' indicating a methodical approach tailored for beginners. The description details specific circuits, each focusing on different muscle groups, which underscores a structured and disciplined format. The use of intervals (40 seconds work, 20 seconds rest) across three circuits further supports this categorization. Additionally, comments mention the instructor's focus on proper form and techniques, reinforcing a disciplined method.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is assigned a moderate score of 0.5. Although the workout lacks a flowing sequence typically driven by music, the continuous movement transitions between exercises, especially in the context of a circuit, introduce an element of rhythm in its execution.\n\nOther spirits, such as High-Energy & Intense and Soothing & Restorative, are less applicable. The absence of jumping further diminishes the intensity, and the comments focus on beginner-friendly execution rather than relaxation or recovery."
