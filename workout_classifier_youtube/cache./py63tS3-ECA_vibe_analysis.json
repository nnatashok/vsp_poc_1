  "vibesExplanation": "The video, titled \"Daily Stretch Routine \u2600\ufe0f 20 min relaxing full body stretches,\" strongly suggests a calming and grounding vibe, consistent with 'The Zen Flow'. The use of terms like \"relaxing\", \"gentle yoga\", and \"full body stretching\" in the description and tags indicates a focus on breath-centered, unhurried movement, typical of 'The Zen Flow', deserving a high score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, there is an element of rejuvenation and refreshment that aligns with 'The Reboot Workout'. The emphasis on a \"daily stretch routine\" and phrases such as \"flexibility, mobility & relaxation,\" coupled with comments praising its mood-enhancing qualities, suggest a medium score of 0.75 for 'The Reboot Workout'.\n\nThere is very little suggestion of intensity, competitiveness, or gamification, which excludes vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor'. Thus, high confidence is appropriate for these selections."
