  "vibesExplanation": "The video's title, 'Senior & Beginner Workout - 15 minute Gentle Chair Yoga,' and its emphasis on being 'gentle' and 'chair' based strongly suggest the vibe of 'The Comfort Moves,' which is perfect for safe, cozy, feel-good movement. This is further supported by tags like 'chair yoga,' 'easy,' and 'seated,' and the video's description highlighting a comfortable, floor-free experience for flexibility and relaxation. Additionally, comments from viewers, such as the calming effect and suitability for seniors, reinforce this classification.\n\nThe 'Reboot Workout' vibe is also relevant, as the description and metadata suggest a focus on a total-body refresh through stretching that can relieve tension and aid reset. Tags like 'gentle' and 'low impact' and comments from users who find it calming and helpful in post-treatment recuperation suggest a supportive, stress-relieving nature, indicative of a reboot. Both vibes are rated with high confidence due to explicit descriptive evidence and user feedback."
