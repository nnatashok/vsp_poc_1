  "categoriesExplanation": "The video title and description clearly focus on 'Full Body Stretch' and 'Recover on your rest day,' aiming to 'Improve Mobility & Flexibility.' These elements explicitly indicate a Stretching workout, as the main purpose is enhancing flexibility. The repeated emphasis on rest and recovery further suggests a Stretching workout, leading to a very high score of 0.95 for Stretching.\n\nAdditionally, although the description mentions 'Performing on a mat,' the category of 'Mat' has been assigned a lower score of 0.5 since the routine is performed on an exercise mat and involves no other equipment. However, 'Mat' is not the primary focus; thus, the score is lower compared to Stretching.\n\nThe comments support the video being a Stretching routine, as users mention it as a favorite stretch routine, alignment with rest days, and inclusion of auditory cues often used in stretching routines. Meanwhile, no indicators suggest elements of other specific workout types like HIIT or Weight workouts, confirming the exclusion of those categories."
