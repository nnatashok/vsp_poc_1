  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this video is 'Soothing & Restorative,' evidenced by the video's focus on healing, emotional balance, and addressing depression through yoga. This is supported by the title \"Yoga For Depression\" and phrases in the description like \"balance and restore,\" \"tend to your nervous system,\" and \"heal naturally.\" The tags further emphasize healing and stress relief, such as \"yoga for stress relief,\" \"yoga for healing,\" and \"yoga therapy.\" The high view count and content-related comments indicate it has resonated deeply with viewers seeking emotional comfort, strengthening this spirit's classification with a strong score of 1.0.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a moderate score of 0.6. The practice invites participants to connect their mind and body through breath-focused, continuous movement, hallmarks of this spirit. However, the flow aspect is secondary to the video's primary restorative aim, thus the lower score.\n\nOther spirits like 'Sport & Agility' or 'High-Energy & Intense' are irrelevant due to the gentle nature of the session."
