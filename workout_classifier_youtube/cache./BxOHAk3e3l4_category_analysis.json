  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned to this workout is \"Stretching\" with a very high confidence (0.9). The title, description, and tags all indicate a focus on stretching and improving flexibility. Phrases like \"Full Body Stretch & Mobility,\" \"improve your mobility and flexibility,\" and \"Follow along stretch\" strongly suggest a stretching routine. The emphasis on relieving tight muscles and enhancing flexibility further supports this classification. \"Mat\" is also relevant with a score of 0.6, given that this is a floor-based routine without specific equipment mentioned beyond the body itself, typical of exercises performed on a mat. The reference to \"do this anywhere\" implies it's a mat-based routine, often performed on the floor. Overall, the metadata points with clear evidence towards a stretching workout, potentially done on a mat, thus excluding other categories like yoga or weight workouts."
