  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is predominantly a 'Breathing exercises' training session, as evidenced by the title '15 Mins Pranayama Practice | 5 Deep Breathing Exercises you should do Daily' and the tags such as 'pranayama', 'breathing exercises', and 'deep breathing'. The description further mentions specific breathing practices like 'Kapalbhati, Bhastrika, Nadi Shodhan, and Bhramari Pranayama', which are well-known breathing techniques in yoga. Therefore, the category 'Breathing exercises' is highly relevant with a confidence score of 0.95 as it is the central focus of the video. The secondary category 'Yoga' is also applicable because all these breathing exercises are forms of pranayama, which is a fundamental component of yoga practices. The tags like 'pranayama yoga', 'yogic breathing', and 'yoga video' justify the inclusion of the 'Yoga' category with a score of 0.7. The channel's focus on yoga and the absence of physical postures or sequences exclude other fitness categories such as 'Stretching' or 'Mat'."
