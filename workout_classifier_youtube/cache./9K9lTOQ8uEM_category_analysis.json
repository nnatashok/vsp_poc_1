  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Calisthenics' with a score of 1.0, due to the explicit mention of various calisthenics exercises in the title, tags, and video description, such as pushups and chin-ups, which are classic calisthenic moves. The video's focus is on building muscle through these exercises, highlighted by phrases like 'the best muscle building calisthenics exercises' and 'calisthenics exercises for getting a bigger chest, arms, shoulders, legs and back.' Additionally, terms like 'calisthenics exercises,' 'calisthenic workout,' and 'calisthenics workout routine' solidify its classification as calisthenics-focused.\n\nThe 'Body weight' category is also relevant with a score of 0.8, as the exercises discussed rely on body weight for resistance, such as handstand pushups and pullups, indicated by tags like 'bodyweight exercises' and 'bodyweight only workout.' This category is secondary yet notably present, as all referenced exercises utilize body weight, underlined by the description's point that these exercises 'can be performed without needing any equipment at all.'\n\nThere is high confidence in this classification due to the strong alignment between the video's content and these categories."
