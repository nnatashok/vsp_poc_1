  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily an indoor cycling routine which generally does not require complex movement patterns. Cycling on stationary equipment eliminates factors like balance and coordination typical of road cycling. The routine includes 'high cadence drills' and 'micro intervals' which demand some cycling proficiency but do not enter advanced technical complexity. Hence, it fits between the Beginner and Intermediate levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'tough training session' with 'micro intervals,' indicating a high intensity of physical effort. These intervals demand a high rate of perceived exertion, with effort levels reaching 9 and 10. With a duration of over 33 minutes and the rigorous cycle of effort and rest, it requires significant cardiovascular and muscular endurance, classifying it as Challenging for those in low shape.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is challenging due to intensity and duration, with intervals reaching effort levels 9 and 10. While technique is simple enough for a beginner level, the effort is suited for those with some prior cardiovascular endurance experience. Therefore, Beginners can participate with caution, especially if motivated or accustomed to similar activities, while Intermediate to Advanced individuals would find it appropriately demanding, given the intensity and duration of over 33 minutes."
