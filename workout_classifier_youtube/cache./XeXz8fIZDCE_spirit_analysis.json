  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit identified is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a very high score of 0.9. This classification is strongly supported by the video's focus on healing and pain relief for back problems, as indicated by the title 'Yoga For Lower Back Pain' and the description, which mentions offering tools for healing and preventive care. The calming and gentle nature of the workout is further emphasized in user comments, where viewers describe significant relief from pain and stress through repeated practice. The use of terms like 'gentle cobra stretch' aligns with restorative aspects.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm', with a moderate score of 0.5. The yoga practice likely includes fluid sequence movements, characteristic of yoga flows, enhancing the mind-body connection and the smooth progression between poses. However, the primary focus remains on restoration, so this spirit is less dominant.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the lack of indicators of intense or sport-specific activity. The channel\u2019s emphasis on overall yoga practice, tailored for all abilities, further supports the restorative nature of the workout."
