    "Great routine . Been getting out of my depression because  of my wife loss and it&#39;s been a new beginning.  Getting up in Jesus name! Bless you both",
    "Hi everyone, I am 33 years old, I started this workout about month ago. before that I was feeling anxiety, panic attacks, depression and dizziness. Also my blood pressure was about 140-150/90, Now I feel a lot of energy, blood pressure is about 120/80 and all day I am waiting my workout time :)) I love this stuff thank you so much!",
    "I\u2019m a 53 years old woman. My daughter was the one who first introduced me to your channel. I\u2019ve been working out with your videos every other day since August (over 6 months) and I love you guys. I feel so much stronger and my body is changing for the best. You guys keep me motivated. Please keep up the good work!!! \ud83d\ude0a",
    "More of these 60 minute workouts, please. &lt;3 - Either way I love your workouts, also that there is no talking, and its so helpful, that you show beginner and advanced variations. I also particularly like your locations and the design of the visual/audible cues are so aesthetic. First I came for any &quot;random&quot; cardio workout, I&#39;m staying because you guys are so great and there are so many more great workouts to discover. Thanks!",
    "You guys have the best fitness channel ever! I love the consistency, and you guys are very straightforward. I had a personal trainer but it got too expensive after a few months and I wouldn\u2019t know what to do by myself at the gym. I\u2019m able to get a great workout from the comfort of my home thanks to you guys!! Much love \u2764\ufe0f"
