  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video's metadata indicates it is specifically designed for beginners, as shown in the title '10 min Morning Yoga Stretch for Beginners' and tags such as 'beginner yoga' and 'easy yoga'. The description also emphasizes this by stating 'great for beginners'. Additionally, the lack of props and simple stretch focus suggests minimal coordination and balance challenges. While there is a mention of a strengthening aspect, the overall context implies simple poses, confirming a beginner level with slight nod to intermediate for minor strengthening components.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is only 13.5 minutes long, indicating lower overall effort and energy expenditure. The focus is on 'morning stretch' and 'energy boost', with comments and tags associated with gentle and invigorating sequences. While primarily light, the inclusion of strengthening poses suggests a slight increase in effort for very deconditioned users, justifying a moderate score as well.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "This workout is primarily aimed at beginners, as evidenced by repeated references in the title and tags, and supported by user comments describing accessibility for inexperienced users. The inclusion of minor strengthening poses and a slightly more energetic flow indicates some suitability for those at the intermediate level. Given the 13.5-minute duration and the energizing intent, the workout is generously inclusive for both beginners and newer intermediates, aligning with the need for multiple fitness levels."
