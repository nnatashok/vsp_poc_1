  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled \"20 MIN FULL BODY STRETCH - for Stress Relief & Flexibility (Minimal Talking),\" indicating a stretching routine that is typically performed on a mat for comfort and safety. The description also emphasizes \"calming stretch routine,\" further implying the need for a mat to perform this comfortably on the floor. The mention in the description of \"THE MAT I USE (Exercise 6X4)\" with a purchase link provides explicit evidence that a mat is required for the workout. Thus, we assign a very high confidence score of 1.0 for the need for a mat. No other equipment such as dumbbells, resistance bands, or exercise machines is indicated or typically necessary for the described stretching and flexibility exercises."
