  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Breathing exercises' with a high score of 0.9. This is due to the explicit emphasis on 'breathwork' in both the title ('10 Minute Balancing Breathwork') and description, which focuses on guiding through a series of breaths. The video includes various breath techniques, as supported by the links to other breath-focused practices like 'Ujjayi Breathing' and 'Breath of Fire'. The channel 'Yoga With Adriene' frequently features yoga and related practices, giving further support that this video follows that trend.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Yoga,' scored at 0.7. Despite the focus on breathing, the practice is hosted on a yoga-centric channel, featuring language and intent aligned with yoga principles, such as balance, healing, and mind-body connection, evidenced by comments and tags such as 'yoga practice' and 'morning yoga'.\n\nOther categories such as 'Meditation' or 'Stretching' were considered but not chosen because the content description and user comments are oriented more towards active breathwork rather than passive meditative or stretching exercises."
