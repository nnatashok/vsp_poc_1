  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen for this workout is 'Stretching' with a score of 1.0 due to the strong emphasis on stretch exercises throughout the metadata. The title, '10 Minute Full Body Stretch & Mobility [DAILY ROUTINE],' and several tags such as 'full body stretch,' 'flexibility routine,' and 'mobility routine' all point directly to a stretching focus. The description further supports this by presenting the video as a 'stretch and mobility routine' that aids in pain, tension, or soreness reduction, which aligns well with stretching objectives. The top comments also highlight the routine's effectiveness as a stretch, with users performing it for muscle relief and recovery. \n\nA secondary category 'Yoga' is assigned a low score of 0.2 as yoga often incorporates stretching and flexibility elements, which might overlap with some of the video content. However, there is no explicit evidence directly indicating yoga postures or practices, hence the low confidence and score. The compelling evidence for 'Stretching' and the absence of explicit yoga indicators led to the exclusion of other categories."
