  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is classified as 'Beginner' with a strong score of 0.7 due to the simplicity of stretching exercises focusing on flexibility. There are no complex movement patterns, and the target areas (hips and hamstrings) are commonly addressed in basic stretching routines, making the movements accessible. Some stretches may require moderate flexibility, adding a slight 'Intermediate' level element, reflected in the 0.5 score. The routine is a follow-along video that doesn't involve technical cues beyond standard stretching.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's effort difficulty is mainly 'Light', evidenced by its design for recovery and flexibility. The session focuses on stretches, which inherently demand less energy expenditure compared to active workouts (score 0.8). The 26-minute duration has potential for 'Moderate' effort for very deconditioned users (score 0.4), particularly those unaccustomed to stretching or with low baseline flexibility, as suggested by a user comment about the perceived difficulty of the stretches.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner' (score 0.8), reflecting the video's format as a recovery and flexibility routine accessible to most users, even if they are new to exercising. Given the inclusion of some stretches that might be more challenging for extremely inflexible participants, an 'Intermediate' level is also appropriate (score 0.4). User feedback supports this distribution, where regular exercisers perceive the routine as beneficial, indicating it is feasible for those with some prior exercise experience."
