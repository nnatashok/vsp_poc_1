  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'Morning Stretch' which aligns with activities often done on a mat, such as yoga. This is supported by references to yoga in both the title ('Yoga inspired') and description ('Yoga inspired 5 Minute Morning Stretch for Beginner'). Additionally, there is a direct mention in the description of a mat with a link provided ('Das ist meine Matte'), and the tags include 'no equipment,' suggesting minimal equipment involvement apart from possibly a mat. The confidence score of 0.8 reflects the explicit mention and logical necessity of a mat for floor stretches typically found in yoga. This deduction is further bolstered by evidence of suggested mat brands provided by the creator, indicating its use in her routines."
