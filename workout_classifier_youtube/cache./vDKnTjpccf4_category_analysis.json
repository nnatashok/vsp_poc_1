  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is primarily classified under 'Indoor biking' with a very high confidence level due to explicit references to indoor cycling and turbo training sessions both in the title and throughout the metadata. The title mentions 'Hill Climb Training,' and the description clarifies that the workout is an indoor cycling session designed to replicate hill intervals, further confirming this classification.\n\nThe 'HIIT' category is also applicable with a strong presence as the title explicitly states 'High Intensity,' and tags include 'high intensity interval training' and 'interval training'. The workout description suggests a challenging session with increasing resistance, indicative of interval training.\n\nThe Global Cycling Network channel focuses on cycling, which supports the classification as 'Indoor biking'. User comments highlight the intensity and resistance of the workout, aligning with HIIT concepts. Other categories such as 'Running' or 'Treadmill' are excluded due to no indication of running or use of treadmills."
