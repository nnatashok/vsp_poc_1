  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises described are static stretches with each held for about 30 seconds. Static stretches typically require minimal coordination and are easy to perform with basic instructions, aligning with a Beginner level. The possibility of some variety in stretches, which are targeted for runners, slightly pushes towards Intermediate, but overall, the simplicity of static stretching for common tight areas keeps Beginner as the primary classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the low technique difficulty and effort difficulty, this routine is accessible to absolute beginners with minimal fitness experience. However, the focus on aiding runners and the existence of multiple comments from active individuals suggests an Intermediate level could also engage positively, particularly if they are looking for a recovery or maintenance routine. Thus, both Beginner and Intermediate levels are apropos, but primary alignment is toward Beginners."
