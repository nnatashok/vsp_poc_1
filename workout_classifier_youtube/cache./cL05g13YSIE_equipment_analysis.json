  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is explicitly described as 'No Equipment' in both the title ('No Equipment') and tags ('no equipment workout', 'bodyweight hiit'). The description also emphasizes that the workout is \"bodyweight only,\" confirming that no additional weight training or specialized equipment is required for the exercises. The mention of a 'mat' in the description ('You will simply need your mat') makes it clear that a mat is recommended, likely for comfort during floor exercises such as push-ups and mountain climbers. Thus, a mat is included with very high confidence for this workout, as it is specified as essential. No other equipment types from the list are necessary because the entire routine relies on bodyweight exercises, reflecting the high-intensity bodyweight nature of the session."
