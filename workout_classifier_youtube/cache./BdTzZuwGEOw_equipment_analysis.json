  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled '20 Min Yoga Flow for Beginners' suggests that this is a yoga session, ideally performed on a mat. The use of a mat is typical in yoga classes to provide comfort and stability during poses, especially for beginners. The video tags include 'yoga', 'asana', and 'yoga for beginners', further supporting that this is a yoga session. A user comment mentions it being a perfect choice for those who have 'never stepped on a mat', which indicates the assumption of mat usage. Therefore, with high confidence, a mat is the required equipment for this workout."
