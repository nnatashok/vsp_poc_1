I can feel my muscles strengthening.<br><br>A late update after 1 month : I lost 4 kgs\ud83d\ude0d, even without any changes in diet . Feeling more and more motivated day by day. If I can do it. Anyone can do it.<br>2 months update: lost 6 kgs. Happy and motivated<br>3 Rd month update: I was busy with work and lost my routine. Still hanging to 6 kg loss. I have started again and this time Iam confident that I will get back my routine and achieve the Target.<br>7 months update : lost 9 kgs,\ud83e\udd29 with no changes in diet, but I added slow jogging to my routine...3-4 days a week.<br>Thanku ladies for so much love! \ud83d\udc9e<br>A year apart: I had my weight loss resolution on my star birthday 2023. And today, a year later, on my star birthday..I see I lost 10 kg. A slow steady add on daily has now become a routine (though there are days when I don&#39;t feel like doing anything and skipping workout). A year older today but feeling younger and healthier than last year.",

Feeling proud of myself.<br>Day3: Lacking motivation but im just gonna keep going ahead, bc i made a goal so imma stick with it.",
