  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves exercises like goblet squats, stiff leg deadlifts, and walking lunges, which are typical of intermediate technique difficulty requiring some coordination, proper form, and balance. The mention of using dumbbells and adjustable weight options allows users to tailor the difficulty to their level, which suggests a beginner to intermediate level, but with potential advanced complexity for heavier weights or higher reps.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 45 minutes long, which increases the effort level required above a 'light' classification. The structure involves 40 seconds of work with 20 seconds of rest and recommends using heavy weights, hinting at elevated effort difficulty. Given these factors, it can be considered challenging for beginners but moderate to challenging for those with some fitness experience.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "For required fitness level, the combination of intermediate technique and moderate to challenging effort suggests at least an intermediate fitness level for effective and safe participation. However, modifications or lighter weights allow for beginner inclusion, and advanced users can still find the workout beneficial by increasing weight or intensity. The video duration (45 minutes) decreases its suitability for complete beginners but supports inclusion for all levels due to adjustable options."
