  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"How to Get Flexible Part 2 - The 20 Min Guided Stretch Routine\" strongly implies the use of a mat due to its nature as a yoga routine focused on stretching and flexibility. The connection to yoga in both the title and the channel description by \"Yoga With Tim\" suggests a high likelihood that a mat is required for comfort and support during floor-based stretching exercises, thus receiving a confidence score of 0.9. The metadata does not explicitly mention \"blocks,\" but given the context of improved flexibility in yoga, where blocks are sometimes used to assist postures or modifications, there is a moderate chance they could be involved in the workout, earning a confidence score of 0.4. No other specific equipment is mentioned in the metadata or inferred from the comments."
