    "You all have been requesting more SMALL SPACE FRIENDLY workouts! So, if you feel limited working out at home or live in an apartment... this one is for you \u2764",
    "I wanted to leave you one of the biggest thank you comments I could ever leave. Over the last 18 months, your videos have joined me through my health journey. Gym three times a week, eating differently, and your videos daily at home/at the gym - I am down 135 pounds and type 2 diabetic FREE (diagnosed while pregnant in 2017)! The fact your videos range from beginner stages and increase in intensity over time is what helped build my confidence over time. I was able to feel good starting slow and light, and now I love challenging myself with your longer/more rep workouts. Thank you for all you have helped me achieve in the last 18 months. I felt you deserved to finally know what you have done for me!",
    "To anyone who&#39;s reading this:<br>You are strong. You are beautiful. You are powerful. <br>Remind yourself that working out is not a punishment for what you ate, but a celebration of what your body can do!<br>I hope you have a fantastic day :))",
    "i just finished this workout after not having worked out for probably 2 years now, mannn i\u2019m sweating! my legs are shaking \ud83d\ude02 but i\u2019m gonna do this every day for a month and then go back to the gym, 30 minutes flew by so fast i didn\u2019t even blink and it was over! great stuff",
    "Was I overconfident going into this? yes. Was I about to give up halfway through? yes. But I kept telling myself to just try doing the next set and ended up making it through the whole video! This is the first workout I&#39;ve done in over a year. Thank you!"
