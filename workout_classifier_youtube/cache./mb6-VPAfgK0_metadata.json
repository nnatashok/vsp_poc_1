  "description": "Enjoy the deepest relaxation and increase lung capacity with this customizable 30 minute version of the 4-7-8 breathing technique. Just practice for a length of time that works best for you (up to 30 minutes). The breaths gradually slow and extend to an ideal calming pace.\n\n4-7-8 rhythmic breathing is a core part of many meditation and yoga practices as it promotes relaxation and can also be used to help you fall asleep in a shorter period of time. The goal is to calm your sympathetic nervous system, which controls the fight-or-flight response. \n\nNOTE: In this video, the 4-7-8 counting does not follow seconds (the pace is purposefully slower). There are other versions of the 4-7-8 exercise on this channel that have a faster breathing pace and versions that have a slower breathing pace. You should try them all to learn what works best for you.\n\nIf you tend to be a shallow breather, it\u2019s common to feel a little lightheaded when you start taking deeper breaths. This sensation will pass as your body becomes accustomed to a greater flow of oxygen. You can always take a short break and resume the exercise once you feel normal. It is not necessary that your timing perfectly matches the video example. You can take shorter or longer breaths as long as you maintain the ratio - Inhale 4, Hold 7, Exhale 8. Also, try to keep your expectations realistic. Some days will be easier than others, but the more often you practice, the more effective the exercise becomes.\n\n\n\n//  STRUGGLING TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH?\n\nIf you are having difficulty taking a deep enough breath to complete the 4-7-8 exercise, you may wish to begin with a simple video that teaches proper abdominal breathing.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ApAsKd4hYiw\n\n\n\n//  GUIDED HANDS-ON MEDITATIONS\n\nIf you would like to try meditation, I encourage you to try the Hands-On Meditation technique. It's easier than traditional meditation.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzK1U3HzIGbgtuKVCRmXgOV8U1RzC_xcC\n\n\n\n// SOCIAL\n\n\u2022 Instagram https://www.instagram.com/HandsOnMeditation\n\n\u2022 Pinterest https://www.pinterest.com/HandsOnMeditate\n\n\u2022 Twitter https://twitter.com/HandsOnMeditate\n\n\u2022 Facebook https://www.facebook.com/HandsOnMeditation\n\n#HandsOnMeditation\n\nWANT TO HELP SUPPORT THE CHANNEL?\n\u2615 Please, buy me a coffee  https://www.buymeacoffee.com/HandsOnMeditate\n\n________________________\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this approach to anxiety and stress relief.

    "I LOVE this exercise and always use the 10 minute video. I&#39;ve always wanted a longer video. Woohoo!",
    "Just saw a car accident happening before me, all I want to do was crawl into a blanket and sleep, but I still have to be on road for 2 hr for running kids to classes, and then make dinner, feed them and put  to bed, doing this exercise calmed my head. Thank you!",
    "Small suggestion: add some positive reinforcement like &quot;very good, keep going!&quot; between countdown numbers to boost focus and motivation! \ud83d\udcaa",
