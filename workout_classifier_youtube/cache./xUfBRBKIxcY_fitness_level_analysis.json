  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves treadmill running, which is a relatively straightforward activity typically classified as 'Beginner'. Running requires basic coordination and balance but is familiar to most people. However, the mention of 'recovery intervals' and 'inclines' adds a moderate layer of complexity, suggesting a possibility for 'Intermediate' classification. User comments indicate participation from individuals returning to fitness, implying manageable technique demands.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is primarily derived from the 40-minute duration of treadmill run with 'run and recovery intervals', which suggests a structured, demanding workout. 'Calorie Shred' and user comments highlighting substantial calorie burn and personal effort further suggest a 'Challenging' exertion level. However, the presence of intervals provides moments of reduced intensity, moderating the effort to 'Moderate' for some users, especially beginners.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the 40-minute duration and the use of intervals, the workout is primarily suitable for 'Intermediate' users and above. The 'Endurance Calorie Shred' branding and emphasis on effort suggest a requirement for some baseline cardiovascular fitness, making it appropriate for 'Advanced' users looking for a structured challenge. However, since intensity and incline are adjustable, these factors can be tailored to suit 'Beginner' participants who are closely monitoring their comfort zones, justifying a 'Beginner' classification, albeit cautiously."
