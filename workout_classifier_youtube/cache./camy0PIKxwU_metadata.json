    "Thank you, I love your no-nonsense yoga session. No music, no silly spiritual talk, just a relaxing full body yoga routine I can do in the mornings \u2764\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
    "This was perfection. The silence, the time spent in savasana so as not to rush the restorative side of stretching, and the lack of unnecessary talking, just pure instruction \u2764 The difference I felt in my spine between the first crosslegged position to the last was incredible. Thank you so much.",
    "I&#39;m recovering from flu, this was a perfect first session back.  Thanks."
