  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is clearly designed to activate the \"The Warrior Workout\" vibe, characterized by \"sweat-dripping, heart-pounding\" attributes. Evidence includes the high-intensity, high-impact exercises such as \"Pulsing Jump Squat,\" \"Frog Jump,\" and \"High Knee,\" all mentioned in the description. The intense nature and the comments like \"my heart is beating so fast my whole body is shaking\" support a high score (0.8).\n\nThe \"The Firestarter\" vibe is also strongly present due to the short, explosive nature of the workout, lasting only 5 minutes with 40s/20s intervals, designed for being a \"fast workout\" which aligns with the explosive burst concept (score 0.75).\n\nLastly, \"The Endorphin Wave\" vibe is moderately applicable since the workout suggests a steady build of energy and a feel-good factor from high-intensity cardio as evidenced by comments praising its energetic uplift and calorie-burning potential (score 0.6). The comments' acknowledgment of high heart rates and readiness for additional rounds imply a significant endorphin release experience. However, this is less prominent than the primary vibes."
