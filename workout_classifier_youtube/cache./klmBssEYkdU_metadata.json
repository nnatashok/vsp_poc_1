    "Absolut best way to start my day &lt;3",
    "53 years old. Just did my very first yoga session here. Lots of pain. My teenage daughter and wife took great delight in my groans and moans. I feel very good, and I like the way you have described everything. I have committed to doing yoga every morning this week as a way of becoming more healthy.",
    "Please, Adrienne, I would dream of having a 30 days challenge of 10 min morning routine. This one is gorgeous and 10 min would be perfect to create a new yoga habit",
    "My dad told me last night that he has cancer in all of his lymphnodes. He told me that all he can do to beat it is; stay strong. So my word today was strength. When we circled back to the word and I realized how strong I need to be, I cried in happiness. I can do it. Thanks for your videos Adriene!",
    "Here I send an explosion of LOVE  to everyone reading this. <br>You are WORTHY, you are LOVED and you are full of LIGHT. <br>I am going through a difficult period trying to find myself again, so if anyone here feels the same, know that YOU GOT THIS."
