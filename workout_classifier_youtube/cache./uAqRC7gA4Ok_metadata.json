    "You may not consider this as praise coming from a female senior but your beginner routine was truly an encouragement to continue.",
    "This is the first beginners excersise video that I have actually been able to keep up with. The speed and amount are just perfect for someone who is severely untrained. <br>I&#39;ll try to get it to the point where I can do it twice by next week and then try to level up the week after. <br>Thank you mate, I also love these little encouraging gestures during it.",
    "My wife and I have been doing your beginner exercises for 4 days and the truth is that we like it a lot. We are from Spain and every afternoon we put on a session of you and our 2 children also do it to them. A big greeting and thank you for these videos that help us a lot.",
    "Thanks for doing easy tipe of exercise, that most people can do...not like most of the other videos where after 3 exercises you have to do 25 pushups standing on your eyebrows...thanks"
