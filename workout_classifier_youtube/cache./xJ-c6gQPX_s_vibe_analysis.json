  "vibesExplanation": "The video is titled \"10 Minute Third Trimester Prenatal Cardio Workout,\" clearly indicating that it is designed to be safe for prenatal participants, especially those in their third trimester. This positions it well within the 'The Comfort Moves' vibe, which aligns with safe, gentle, and feel-good movements suitable for special populations like prenatal individuals. The inclusion of 'pregnancy-safe cardio' and the assurance for safety suggests a focus on comfort and adaptability, hence a strong score of 0.75 for this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, the short duration (10 minutes) and the description emphasizing a healthy and gentle workout routine suggest elements of 'The Reboot Workout,' focused on low stress and total-body refresh activities. The keyword 'cardio' further aligns with mild intensity, typical of refresh workouts, warranting a score of 0.65.\n\nDespite the comment questioning the safety intensity, the primary metadata suggests the workout remains within a prenatal-friendly category, excluding more intense or high-risk vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush.'"
