  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Yoga,' with a score of 1.0. This is supported by the title 'Yoga for Complete Beginners' and multiple mentions in the description and tags, such as 'yoga for beginners,' 'yoga workout,' and 'yoga for men.' The video's emphasis on proper technique, breathing, and pose modifications aligns with yoga practice, particularly given the beginner focus as noted in 'Yoga for Complete Beginner Series.' The channel itself, 'Man Flow Yoga,' also specializes in yoga, further affirming this classification. \n\nA secondary category 'Stretching' is assigned with a score of 0.3, backed by a mention in the user comments describing relief in the back and legs through basic stretching complementing the routine. This suggests that although the primary focus is yoga, elements of stretching are present, especially for flexibility improvement for beginners. The stretching aspect is supportive of the main yoga practice rather than a separate focus, meriting a lower score. \n\nThe score of 0.95 for category confidence reflects the robust evidence supporting yoga as the central theme, with strong mentions across multiple metadata points."
