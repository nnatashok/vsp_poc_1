  "spiritsExplanation": "The video falls predominantly under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, indicated by terms like 'calming yoga routine,' 'light and easy full body stretches,' 'stress relief and anxiety' used in the title, description, and tags. The purpose is clearly to help de-stress, providing gentle and healing movements, a hallmark of the soothing and restorative category, hence the high confidence score of 1.0. The second possible spirit, with a lower confidence level of 0.4, is 'Flow & Rhythm.' This stemmed from the combination of yoga and stretching, which often involves smooth transitions and coordination of movement. However, given the emphasis on relaxation rather than explicit continuous flow, this spirit is secondary. The comments from users further reinforce the primary spirit, highlighting relaxation, relief from stress, and feeling refreshed, consistent with a restorative approach. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the lack of intensity or athleticism in the workout structure."
