    "i love her excersizes better then all the other ones because it\u2019s not boring like it\u2019s just the perfect amount of challenging",
    "Been doing this and another 20 min workout interchangeably for about a month now. I unintentionally had a week off do to being more busy than usual and I\u2019ve been ancy to get back. I just completed this workout and feel \ud83d\udcaf They\u2019re not too tough but they keep your heart rate up and really make me sweat. Now I\u2019m gonna complete a 5 min lower ab workout to top it off",
    "These workouts are really easy not that much hard. I wonder how these simple workouts can make us sweat so much. But in the end it feels really nice. Very well organized exercise videos. I have got really good results in the past by following your video exercises. And now i have started again. \ud83d\ude0a"
