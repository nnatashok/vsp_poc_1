  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily categorized as 'Yoga' with a high confidence score (0.9) due to explicit mentions in the video title ('Morning Energy Yoga | 20 Minutes | All levels'), tags variously referencing yoga practices ('Morning yoga routine', 'Yoga for energy', 'Beginner yoga flow'), and the description outlining the yoga practice and its benefits (mentions of 'asanas' and a 'sequence of postures'). Moreover, the channel 'Satvic Yoga' is dedicated to yoga practices, solidifying this categorization.\n\nA secondary category of 'Stretching' is included with moderate confidence (0.5), as there are aspects of the workout that aim to awaken muscles and increase circulation, which typically involve stretching. However, the primary focus remains on the yoga practice itself, making this a supporting category rather than the main focus.\n\nAdditionally, 'Breathing exercises' is considered with moderate confidence (0.4) as the description mentions 'deep breathing techniques' as part of the practice, indicating a significant component of the session. This is important for enhancing mental clarity and vitality, as noted in the description. Despite this, it does not define the core of the routine, which remains rooted in yoga practices."
