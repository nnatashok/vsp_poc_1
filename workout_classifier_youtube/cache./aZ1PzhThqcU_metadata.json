  "description": "PDF pose chart here: https://www.yogabody.com/full-body-flexibility-youtube/\n\nIf you have stiff hamstrings, locked up hips, and/or a rigid spine, and you\u2019re looking for a fast, but effective, solution for full body flexibility, this video is for you. \n\nThis 15-minute sequence of poses is very simple and pragmatic. It follows key Science of Stretching principles and uses deep, passive stretches to help change your soft tissues and improve your mobility. However, it is NOT easy and should be used as a post-exercise practice, not a warm-up. Think of it as a supplement to your other activities. \n\nVIDEO CONTENTS\n00:00 Flexibility\n01:33 Science of Stretching\n05:15 Corrective Exercises\n05:34 Wall Doll Pose\n07:58 Cliffhanger Pose\n10:22 Blaster Pose\n15:11 Block Noodle Pose\n17:49 Lightning Bolt Pose\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 Please do not use this video to diagnose or treat a severe injury. If you\u2019re injured or suffering from pain when performing any of these poses, you should see a doctor.\n\nANATOMY OF STRETCHING\nYour myofascial tissues (muscles and fascia) get lots of circulation and have a huge ability to grow, lengthen and transform. However, when you stretch, does it sometimes feel like you're fighting your own muscles? This is called your myotatic reflex or stretch reflex. It happens when the muscle spindles, the stretch-sensing nerves inside your muscles, signal to your spinal cord and cause your muscles to tense up to protect you from stretching too far or too fast. \n\nTo combat this, you need to slow down, hold your stretches for longer and use breathing techniques to reduce the myotatic response. In this video we\u2019ll show you how to do both. \n\nBEST PRACTICES \nThese poses should always be done after a workout, never before. This is stretching with a capital S, meaning it\u2019s very intense and is designed to affect change in your soft tissues. If possible, do it before bed when your body has plenty of time to recover afterwards. \n\n5 POSES WE'LL LEARN \n1) Wall Doll\n2) Cliffhanger\n3) Blaster\n4) Block Noodle\n5) Lightning Bolt\n\nWANT MORE? \n* Science of Stretching 5-Day program: https://www.yogabody.com/stretching/\n* Join our YOGABODY Daily at-home fitness program: https://www.yogabody.com/yb-daily/\n* Lucas' podcast: http://www.LucasRockwoodShow.com \n* Main site: http://www.yogabody.com/ \n\nLike this video?
