  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified under \"Flow & Rhythm\" (0.8) due to the emphasis on continuous movement patterns, as indicated by the title \"Morning Energy Yoga | 20 Minutes | All levels\" and descriptions of flowing through sequences to awaken muscles and stimulate energy centers. The use of the term \"yoga flow\" and the importance of mind-body connection during the practice align closely with this spirit.\n\nThe additional classification of \"Soothing & Restorative\" (0.6) is supported by the description's focus on awakening the body gently in the morning, with an emphasis on deep breathing techniques and modifications making it suitable for all levels. Comments highlight the energizing yet calming effect, which fits well with a soothing approach.\n\nOther spirits, such as \"High-Energy & Intense,\" were considered but excluded due to lack of intense or rigorous descriptors, focusing instead on gentle awakening and energy. Similarly, while there is an element of structure, it didn't emphasize technical precision over relaxation, hence the \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit was not selected."
