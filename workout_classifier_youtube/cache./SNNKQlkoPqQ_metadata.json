    "Every time I watch Tom&#39;s videos I felt so calm and I don&#39;t even know why. The world&#39;s a better place with your videos in it",
    "When you&#39;re so inflexible that sitting on your knees alone already feels like you&#39;re doing some advanced type of stretch \ud83d\ude05<br><br>Just a little update: I&#39;ve been lifting and stretching right after 3x a week for 1 month straight and can now sit on my knees without issue among numerous other things that gave me trouble or discomfort before \ud83d\udc4d",
    "I&#39;ve been doing your 15 minute routine three times a week for the last year, and it&#39;s made a huge difference to my life.  The lat stretches in particular.  My only complaint about that routine was that aside from the neck and lat stretches, the rest of the upper body stretches didn&#39;t really &quot;do it&quot; for me.<br><br><br>This new routine&#39;s upper body stretches are far more helpful for me.  But I found that the lower body stretches didn&#39;t feel as effective as those from the older routine.  So I think that I will alternate routines to start with, and might create a combined routine out of both of them, so that both my upper and lower body get a good stretch in a single routine.<br><br><br>Thank you for doing these videos.  They&#39;ve really helped me!",
    "Hey man, your routines have literally changed my life. I&#39;ve been having less headaches and neck soreness since I started following you and following your guidance. Thanks for the awesome job!",
    "Four of us over 60 girls have been doing this and love the feel.  Thank you for the calm, clear, specific directions. Felt amazing!"
