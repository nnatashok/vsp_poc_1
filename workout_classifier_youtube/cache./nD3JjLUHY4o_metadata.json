  "description": "Welcome to this guided meditation for sleep relaxation to help you let go of worries and strengthen your health, which is especially important during difficult or challenging times.\n\nThis guided relaxation experience is a form of sleep meditation with spoken suggestions for complete relaxation, accompanied with a soothing soundscape of gentle background sleeping music.\n\nThis sleep healing meditation session combines aspects of guided imagery and visualization, as well as a focus on chakra energy centres of the body, with powerful affirmations for boosting the immune system, for clearing the mind's thoughts, for letting go of negativity, for encouraging overall well being, and for balancing all emotions. \n\nJust listen along and allow yourself to relax deeply, as you learn how to let go of physical tensions, as well as melt away unwanted stresses or worries in the mind. Reduce the effects of overthinking, as you turn down any excessive noise of mind chatter by more easily floating and drifting into blissful sleep and soothing dreams, at every bedtime. \n\nI hope you relax and enjoy this sleep focused journey towards your positive health and wellness :) \n\nDownload this track MP3 for free here: \u25ba https://michael-sealey.dpdcart.com/cart/add?product_id=194065&method_id=210458\n\n\u00a0Subscribe for more meditation & hypnosis: \u25ba http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=MichaelSealey\n\nDownloads on iTunes: \u25ba https://itunes.apple.com/au/artist/michael-sealey/id921827456\n\nDepression & Anxiety Recovery Pack 5 x MP3 Digital Audio Collection here:  \u25ba https://michael-sealey.dpdcart.com/cart/add?product_id=121819&method_id=129715\n\nSleep Meditation 4 x MP3 Digital Audio Collection here: \u25ba https://michael-sealey.dpdcart.com/cart/add?product_id=155119&method_id=165916\n\nThis session is suitable for repeated listening.

  "channelDescription": "Hypnosis | Hypnotherapy | Sleep Hypnosis | Guided Meditation\n\nHi, my name is Michael and welcome to my channel, where I hope you can stop by to relax, listen in, and see for yourself the power of positive hypnosis.\n\nHypnosis is a completely natural state of often deeply felt relaxation and focused attention, where positive suggestions can be more easily accepted by our subconscious minds. Imagine a fantastic and tranquil state of daydreaming, and that is very close to hypnosis!  \n\nHypnosis can bring us improved self control, clearer and empowered behavioural choices, and allow us to listen to our best inner resources. Many people experience a deep sense of calmness and serenity during hypnotic meditation and are often pleasantly surprised to see the ongoing, life enhancing results. \n\nThank you greatly for your support, feel free to subscribe and comment on your great results, and I trust you will benefit from your time spent with positive hypnosis.\n\nPeace & Enjoy",

    "You&#39;ve helped me in more ways you&#39;ll ever truly understand. I was homeless, sleeping in an abandoned car that was just the frame of the car. There weren&#39;t any windows, no windshield, no seats and no cushioning. In the middle of a brutal winter. It was simply metal and very very cold. I was depressed like never before but a big thanks to you! You gave me strength and hope and with that I was able to get through it. My life has since changed for the better. I have a good job, my own apartment , 3 beautiful children and an amazing wife who is the one that introduced me to you (Michael Sealey)  In the first place. I feel so blessed and grateful for the life I&#39;m living now. Without u i wouldn&#39;t have made it.  Thank u for all you&#39;ve done for me. The lives you&#39;ve touched shall nevr go unnoticed.<br>You&#39;re beyond talented. You&#39;re blessed with an amazing gift. God bless u \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",
