  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as 'Meditation' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This classification is based on multiple indicators from the metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'Meditation' as a key component, and the description elaborates further by stating that it is a 'Guided Mindfulness meditation' provided by a reputable source, the Oxford Mindfulness Centre. The tags 'body scan' and 'mindfulness meditation' reinforce the meditation aspect. Furthermore, top comments reflect personal experiences with meditation, focusing on qualities like calmness, guidance, and attention. A minor secondary category, 'Breathing exercises', is assigned a score of 0.2. This reflects the potential presence of controlled breathing elements during a typical body scan meditation, but the evidence for this is less explicit. Categories like 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were excluded due to the absence of any physical postures or flexibility elements mentioned in the metadata."
