  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit for this workout is 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the focus on VO2 max intervals, which are indicative of high-intensity sessions meant to push physical limits, as mentioned in the title and description. The use of terms like 'not easy', 'intensity', 'torque style efforts', and repeated mentions of 'VO2 Max' and 'power output' further emphasize the intense nature intended to elevate the heart rate significantly. The score of 0.9 reflects a strong confidence from these explicit indicators of intensity.\n\nThe workout also embodies 'Structured & Disciplined' qualities, as it follows a specific pattern of intervals ('6 sets of 2 min, broken down into 30s seated, 30s out of the saddle attack'). The structured interval approach showcases a disciplined regimen typical of methodical cycling training, hence a score of 0.8. \n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are not applicable here due to the workout's emphasis on high intensity and structured efforts rather than smooth, relaxing movements."
