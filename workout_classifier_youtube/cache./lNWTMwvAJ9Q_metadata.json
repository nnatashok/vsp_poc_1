    "Thank you so much for sharing your yoga sessions with the world. Every morning I practice with one of your videos before getting ready for work, I have ADHD and having this practice daily really makes a huge difference.   Greetings from Colombia!",
    "Your yoga is my favourite yoga! I don&#39;t know what type it is exactly, but I&#39;ve been following along with your videos for about 2 years now. It&#39;s so relaxing!!",
    "I have mostly done vinyasa which I enjoy but in the mornings my favourite is gentle sitting / laying down stretches, with other words - your videos! I\u2019ve been starting my mornings with you for 2 years now and your videos have become an integral part of my routine. Thank you so much for sharing your classes, effort and beautiful energy Bird \ud83e\ude77 and congratulations on your wedding. Here\u2019s to a lifetime of happiness for you two! \ud83d\udc9e",
    "My favorite type of yoga is this \u2764 And I prefer laying because of my back pain but doing both is also good. \ud83d\udc4d",
    "Congrats on your wedding! My fav poses are the ones I can do laying down cause it helps with back aches and pains and I feel like I release a lot of tension laying down on the floor. I also enjoy hip openers! \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\ude18"
