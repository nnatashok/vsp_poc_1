    "Do not stay in inhalation for too long as it activates your sympathetic nervous system (fight and flight mechanism). Instead, focus on elongating the exhalation time. That activates your parasympathetic nervous system (feed, breed, rest, digest).<br>Parasympathetic is good for your health, healing, hair, immune system, sleep, longevity, eyes, wrinkles, sex etc. <br>Here&#39;s what I recommend as it has worked for me. Do this 10-20 minutes daily.<br>4 seconds in (deeply from belly)<br>1 second hold<br>10 seconds out (very slowly until your belly caves in and no more air remains in your lungs)<br><br>Edit: Slowly try to increase your exhalation time to as long as possible. That will, then, mimick tortoise breathing. As we all know, the lifespan of a tortoise can reach upto 400years. There&#39;s a theory that suggests that it might be linked to how much they breathe. A tortoise breathes 3-4 times per minute. Contrast that to a human&#39;s 12-18 breaths/minute or a dog&#39;s 20-30 breaths/minutes. Human lifespan is 100years and most dog breeds don&#39;t live into their third decade. <br>My point is that you need to train your subconscious mind to take slow deep breaths even when you are not conscious of it. You do that by practicing the tortoise breathing where you exhale for as long as possible. Some advanced yoga practitioners or Chinese Qigong practitioners even manage to exhale so slowly, it lasts for a couple of minutes. Meaning they breathe once/per minute and thus keep the magical parasympathetic nervous system activated all the time. Contrast that to us so-called modern people who breathe in shallowly for a couple of seconds (keeping most of our lungs starved for oxygen) and then exhale so damn quickly as if it would cost us money otherwise (thus keeping most of Carbon Dioxide stuck in our body). Thus, our body stays in the stressful fight/flight mode all the time, fills our body with cortisol and all sorts of stress causing stuff. Yup, not good because when your body is stressed out, it does some crazy stuff like storing excess fat like a madman, making you crave sugar, steals protein from your hair and nails to reallocate them elsewhere. Redirects blood from your gut to your muscles so you can run faster and climb tree quickly. This messes up your digestion which in turn wrecks all your efforts of eating nutritious foods. <br>So, please do yourself a favor and practice slow-deep breathing with long exhalation daily. Also, if it works for you, don&#39;t forget to share it with your parents because they probably need it the most right now. <br>May you stay in parasympathetic mode all the time.<br>Let&#39;s save the sympathetic fight/flight mode for when we are being chased by a goddamn sabertooth tiger!",
    "No lie I just woke up, did this about 4 , 5 times and never woke up the whole night .Now that&#39;s rare for me, am used to laying in bed for 3 hours before falling asleep.Then I&#39;ll wake up every 2 hours or so. Am a little excited, definitely doing the same tonight hoping I get the same results. Y&#39;all have a wonderful day",
