  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '15-Minute Guided Meditation to Reset Your Nervous System' suggests a meditation session intended for calming and balancing the nervous system. The description explicitly states that the meditation can be practiced either seated or lying down, with hands placed on different parts of the body for breathing exercises. There is no mention of any physical workout or the need for exercise equipment. The references to guided meditation, vagus nerve meditation, and yoga meditation imply a focus on mindfulness and relaxation rather than physical exercise. Comments reflect users practicing meditation in seated positions and experiencing relaxation, indicating no use of equipment. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, with no equipment required for effective participation."
