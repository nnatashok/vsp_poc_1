  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Body weight', evidenced by multiple references to 'bodyweight leg workout', 'using only your bodyweight', and 'bodyweight workout' in the title, description, and tags. The emphasis on using the body as resistance without any equipment supports a classification score of 0.9 for 'Body weight'.\n\nThe second category is 'Calisthenics', which is substantiated by the use of compound movements like lunges and squats performed in giant sets. The explicit mention of 'calisthenics' in the title and tags indicates a strong presence of calisthenic principles in the workout, justifying a score of 0.8. \n\nThis workout doesn't involve weights or machines, eliminating 'Weight workout' as a category. Similarly, it lacks explicit HIIT structure or equipment usage like yoga mats typically dominant in 'Mat' workouts. The detailed description supports a confident classification into 'Body weight' and 'Calisthenics' due to repeated references and the nature of exercises."
