  "categoriesExplanation": "The video primarily focuses on a Buteyko breathing exercise, as indicated by the title 'Buteyko Breathing - Breathe Light, Slow & Deep.' This is reinforced by repeated mentions of 'breathing exercises' in both the tags and description, such as 'breathing exercises for anxiety' and 'Buteyko breathing guided.' The explicit instructions involving breath control and CO2 levels classify it strongly as Breathing exercises with a score of 1.0.\n\nAdditionally, elements such as calming the nervous system, the description of slowing consciousness, and user comments mentioning the calming, centering effects, suggest a secondary meditation-like experience, scoring it at 0.6 for Meditation. Though the focus is not on traditional meditation, the mindfulness and relaxation aspects are relevant. Other categories like Yoga are indirectly referenced through breathing techniques but are not strongly enough featured to warrant inclusion."
