  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.75 as it is a 20-minute bodyweight strength session with a focus on methodical, full-body movements, including active and isometric components. The description highlights a mixture of movements aimed at maximizing strength and stability, with specific mentions of 'no equipment,' 'time under tension,' and 'isometric holds,' all indicative of a structured approach. Additionally, comments mention the use of timers, progress bars, and how-tos, signaling a disciplined structure. \n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is also relevant (score: 0.65), as comments describe participants being drenched in sweat and feeling motivated, suggesting a workout with intense bursts of activity. Although other potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' could relate to the 'flow' mentioned in the description, the focus on strength training and discipline makes the first two spirits more dominant."
