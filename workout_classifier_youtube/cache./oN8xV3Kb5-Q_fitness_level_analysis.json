  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is considered \"Beginner\" due to the simplicity of the exercise, which is a basic breathing technique known as Box Breathing. The metadata describes it as a practice also known as 'four-square breathing' with a clear, repetitive pattern: Inhale 4, Hold 4, Exhale 4, Hold 4. Comments such as 'Perfect and simple' and 'easy to follow along' further support the low complexity of the technique. There are no complex movement patterns or coordination required, which reinforces the beginner level classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty for this exercise is classified as 'Light' because it involves regulated breathing over a short duration. The exercise requires maintaining a breathing pattern for five minutes, which is a low-energy, stress-reduction activity aimed at calming the mind rather than exerting physical effort. Metadata and comments emphasize relaxation and simplicity, such as 'calm breathing exercise' and 'anxiety reduction,' indicating minimal physical demand.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner' due to the straightforward nature of box breathing. It involves following a simple breathing pattern over a short period with minimal risk of physical strain or injury. The gathering of user comments highlights the accessibility of the exercise without requiring previous physical fitness, such as 'easy to follow' and 'simple.' Additionally, the exercise's use by people in high-stress scenarios (e.g., 'U.S. Navy SEALs') suggests it may be beneficial for those seeking beginner to moderate fitness improvements, thus warranting a secondary 'Intermediate' level classification for some users who can manage slight extensions of the breathing holds or modifications if needed."
