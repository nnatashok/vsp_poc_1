  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of a 15-minute core-focused routine without equipment, which suggests moderate complexity. The exercises likely involve multiple movement patterns typical of core workouts, requiring some coordination and body awareness. The comments praise the clarity of instruction and form guidance, supporting an intermediate rating, while the absence of equipment simplifies the technique slightly from potential advanced complexity. The channel is known for accessible, at-home workouts, enhancing the confidence in this classification as intermediate, but suitable for a range of users if guidance is closely followed.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 15-minute duration indicates a short but potentially intense session. The description labels it as an 'intense ab workout,' suggesting higher energy expenditure. User comments like 'omg I\u2019m gonna die' suggest a challenging experience, though some users found it attainable. Keywords such as 'intense' and 'killer' in tags and description imply elevated exertion levels. Given these factors, it likely spans both moderate and challenging effort difficulties, providing a substantial workout without equipment. The workout\u2019s relatively brief length moderates its energy demands for the upper effort classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Although the workout is described as 'intense,' the short duration and equipment-free nature make it accessible to a broad audience with variation in intensity. The technique difficulty being intermediate and the presence of calming guidance align with 'Beginner' to some extent, especially for those with some basic fitness experience. The comments and channel ethos support inclusion of the 'Intermediate' level, as users appreciate the instructional clarity. An 'Advanced' classification fits less due to simplicity and brevity, but fits users looking for a quick, challenging session, evidenced by the intensity hints in metadata."
