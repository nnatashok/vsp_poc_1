    "Hello friends I hope you enjoy the practice, for those that would like to know this was filmed in Alicante and the mountain in the background is called Aitana and it\u2019s the highest in Alicante.",
    "Glorious! Don&#39;t let beginner friendly fool you. I&#39;m a seasoned yogi, and this one is just slow and mindful. Putting this in my regular rotation. Thank you Charlie! Namaste!",
    "I started following you about one year ago, and I&#39;ve been doing the practices almost every day. I have noticed an overall change in how i look and feel. At 5&#39;10&quot;,  I struggle holding certain poses. However, I did malasana for the first time with my feet flat on the ground today. I was so excited I just wanted to share. \ud83d\ude0a I am so happy to have you as my teacher. Thank you for all you do!",
    "I am 50yo and started to practice yoga seriously the day of Christmas. After 2 months and a half,4/5 classes a week, I feel amazing. I feel stronger,confident and peaceful. I can see the changes in my body and my mind. I would have started before,but probably there is the right time for everything.  Thank you Charlie for your classes,you are helping people to find themselves.\u2764",
    "I\u2019m 16 (nearly 17), and I\u2019m out of shape and out of tune with my body. I see several comments from more experienced yoga enthusiasts about how this is a break in their usual routine, yet for me, this is difficult. I hope one day, I will be able to say the same about having these videos in my weekly routine, and I know practice builds and will eventually get me there. Thank you for making these videos, and god bless \ud83d\udc99"
