  "title": "STRENGTH TRAINING for BEGINNERS | Build strength, get toned & speed up metabolism!",
  "description": "This is a beginner strength training workout created for seniors and beginners who have little-to-no experience.  Strength training is great to building strength (obviously!), to get toned and best of all, to speed up metabolism!  I explain each exercise as we go through them to ensure you understand proper form and technique.  Even though I teach the exercises while standing, most of the exercises can also be followed by sitting in a chair.  We'll cover all the major muscle groups today.  There will be no music in the background today since a lot of viewers have expressed they prefer no music when I am giving instructions. Please feel free to put your own music on in the background:)  \n\nI did not include a warm-up simply because I feel a lot of people will do a cardio workout before.  I will be uploading a 5 minute warm up soon which you can do prior to this workout.  Or, choose one of the short workouts I have uploaded already so you are properly warmed up before lifting heavier weights in this workout.  Please challenge yourself by using heavier weights than you might usually use (I've explained it all in this video so you'll understand what weight to use).  Feel free to message me on my website (www.improvedhealthforseniors.com) if you have any questions.  \n\nPlease subscribe and write a comment!  I'd love to hear from you!  Feedback is always welcome!\n\nWishing you improved health!\nJules\n\nDisclaimer:  You should always consult your physician before starting any 'Improved Health' fitness program or any other fitness program.
