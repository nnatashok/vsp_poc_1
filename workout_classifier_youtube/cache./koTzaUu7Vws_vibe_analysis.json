  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is strongly characterized by its Pilates style, indicated by both the title ('40 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT || Intermediate Pilates Class') and the tags, which repeatedly emphasize 'pilates' and 'intermediate'. This suggests a workout that focuses on technique, control, and skill-building, typical of 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe. The description also notes strengthening and an emphasis on legs and core, consistent with a technique-driven approach (Score: 0.75).\n\nThe video's Pilates focus and the channel's description by Nicole, a former dancer and yoga instructor, hint at elements of 'The Zen Flow' vibe. This is supported by comments highlighting Nicole's calm and encouraging voice and cadence, suggesting a grounding and intentional experience typical of 'Zen Flow'. However, as the workout also involves strengthening, this vibe is secondary (Score: 0.65).\n\nThe workout's length (40 minutes) and calming music from Epidemic Sound support a structured, yet rhythmic and peaceful flow, which narrows down the primary vibe to these two options."
