  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under the 'Mat' category with a high confidence score of 0.8 because it involves floor exercises performed without equipment, as evidenced by the need for 'your mat and a bottle of water' and exercises such as 'Silent Burpee to Toes' and 'Side Plank Lift to Arm Sweep'. The inclusion of sequences like 'Stepper Out Jacks' and 'Static Lunge' indicates a focus on body movement without equipment. \n\nThe 'Body weight' category is also relevant with a score of 0.7 due to the exercises such as 'Push Ups', 'Lunges', and 'Planks' that use only body weight as resistance. This classification is supported by the repeated emphasis on 'no equipment' and the exercise list provided.\n\nAn 'Other' category with a score of 0.3 reflects the session's unique aspects of combining low-intensity, steady-state cardio within a home-friendly environment, such as 'Rotational Jab' and 'Skipping', which do not fit neatly into other categories like traditional cardio or strength training, thus warranting a slight inclusion. The extensive list of exercises and detailed structure in the description indicate confidence in the chosen categories."
