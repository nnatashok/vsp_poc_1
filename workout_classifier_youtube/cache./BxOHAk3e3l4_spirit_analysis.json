  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a very high confidence (score 0.9). This is evidenced by the focus on a full body stretch routine that targets mobility and flexibility, aiming to relieve tension in common tight areas without causing strain. The description highlights the routine's utility for pre and post-workout, a common sign of restorative practices. Comments from viewers, such as appreciating the relaxation ('perfect for a relaxed morning') and the non-strenuous nature ('nothing crazy that hurts my hips or knees'), further support the restorative classification.\n\nA secondary spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm' is present with a moderate score (0.4), indicated by the 'follow along' dynamic stretch routine which suggests an emphasis on continuous movement and fluidity. However, the lack of explicit musical or mind-body connection elements lowers the confidence for this spirit.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to the absence of indicators for high intensity, structured discipline, sports-specificity, or outdoor settings."
