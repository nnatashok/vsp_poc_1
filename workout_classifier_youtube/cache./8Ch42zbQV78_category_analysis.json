  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized as 'Indoor biking' with a high confidence score of 0.8 due to the explicit mention of 'Stationary Bike Workout' in the title and tags such as 'cycling workout'. This indicates that the video likely involves a stationary bike, making 'Indoor biking' a central focus.\n\nAdditionally, 'HIIT' is selected with a score of 0.6. This is inferred from the structured intervals described in the top comments, such as '5 min w/u, 30 sec hi, 90 sec low', characteristic of High-Intensity Interval Training. Although the title and description do not explicitly denote HIIT, the mention of high and low intervals in the comments strongly suggests this style of workout. Overall, confidence is high, supported by specific descriptors in the title, comments, and tags indicating both indoor biking and HIIT aspects."
