  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title \"No Equipment 20 Minute Bodyweight Workout | Follow Along\" explicitly states that the workout requires \"No Equipment,\" and the description reinforces this by emphasizing the workout is performed using only bodyweight, with phrases like \"require ZERO equipment\" and \"all you will need is your bodyweight.\" The tags include phrases such as \"no equipment workouts\" and \"bodyweight,\" which further indicate that no additional equipment is used for this workout. Furthermore, comments from viewers requesting more no equipment workouts and appreciating the accessibility for situations without access to gym facilities support this classification. Based on this information, I have very high confidence that no equipment is needed, and the workout is bodyweight only."
