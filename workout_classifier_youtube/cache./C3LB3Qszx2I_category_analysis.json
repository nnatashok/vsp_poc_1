  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified primarily as 'Pilates' with a score of 0.9. This classification is strongly supported by the title ('30 MIN MORNING PILATES'), repeated emphasis on Pilates in the tags (such as 'morning pilates', 'full body pilates workout'), and the channel's focus on Pilates instructed by a certified Pilates teacher. These elements provide very high confidence in identifying the workout as Pilates.\n\nAdditionally, the workout is classified under 'Mat' with a score of 0.7 due to the nature of the exercises being performed on a mat without equipment, as indicated in the description ('Mat from Liforme'), and in the tags ('at home pilates workout no equipment'). The moderate score reflects that while the workout takes place on a mat, the main focus is on Pilates exercises themselves.\n\nOther potential categories like 'Yoga' were excluded despite the channel background as the video specifically categorizes itself as Pilates and focuses on Pilates movements, as indicated explicitly in the title and tags."
