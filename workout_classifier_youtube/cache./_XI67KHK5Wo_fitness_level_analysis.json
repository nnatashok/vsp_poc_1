  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves guided deep breathing, which is a core component of many relaxation and stress-reduction techniques. The movement is minimal and primarily involves breath control, making it accessible for beginners. The tags and description suggest breathwork similar to the Wim Hof method, which, while systematic, is fundamentally simple in its execution. The cautions in the description (e.g., not doing it in water) do not imply technical difficulty; rather, they underline safety considerations applicable to all levels. The comments also reflect ease of access for a wide audience, including children.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is purely a breathing session lasting 14:38 minutes, indicating low physical demand. Deep breathing exercises generally fall into the 'light' category of effort difficulty, as they are not energy-intensive. This video is intended to help reduce stress, as stated in the title, which is typically characteristic of light-effort activities. User comments reflect its daily use and emotional benefit rather than physical exertion.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The breathing session is accessible to beginners due to its low technique and effort difficulty. Breathing exercises typically require minimal physical fitness, making them suitable for people new to exercise or those looking to manage stress. Given the integrative nature of Wim Hof-like methodologies, which can be part of more expansive health practices, some intermediate-level fitness enthusiasts might also find value in its regular inclusion. The broader applicability and benefits noted in the comments further support its beginner-friendliness."
