  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes exercises like pistol squats and pike push-ups, which require moderate coordination and technique, placing them at an intermediate level of technique difficulty. However, the provision of scaled options, such as kneeling push-ups and tabletop variations, makes it accessible for beginners, suggesting a broad range of movements from simple to moderately complex. The video is labeled with terms like 'beginner calisthenics' and 'wrist friendly' which indicate a focus on accessible movements and alternatives for those with limited experience.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 20 minutes aligns with a moderate effort level, especially given that it's a full-body routine combining strength and balance exercises. Comments mention it being challenging and exhausting, suitable for increasing strength and flexibility. The description notes options for different abilities, making it feasible for varied fitness levels, but still potentially challenging for beginners. The inclusion of both strength and core stability exercises (e.g., reverse plank marches, hollow holds) elevates the overall effort to a moderate to challenging level, especially for less conditioned users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is suitable for beginners due to its scalable exercise options and the focus on calisthenics with an emphasis on bodyweight control, flexibility, and strength. It's noted in the comments and description that it's beginner-friendly yet ultimately challenging. Intermediate users will find value in the strength and coordination challenge. The mention of more complex movements like pistol squats and the general physical demands suggest that it can also benefit advanced practitioners looking for a moderate-intensity workout. Following the guideline of including multiple levels due to the exercise options and self-modification potential, fitness levels span from beginner to advanced."
