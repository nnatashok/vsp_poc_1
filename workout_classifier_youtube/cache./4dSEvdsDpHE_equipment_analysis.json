  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'calisthenics home workout' with several mentions in the tags emphasizing 'no equipment,' such as 'calisthenics home workout no equipment' and 'how to start calisthenics at home no equipment.' However, the description explicitly suggests to 'grab your mat,' which indicates that a mat is used, likely for comfort and safety during floor exercises commonly found in calisthenics routines. This presence of a mat contributes to a high confidence level of 0.9, as it is clearly stated in the description and aligns with typical calisthenics exercises performed on the floor."
