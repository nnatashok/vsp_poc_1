  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit for this video is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.95 due to multiple indicators in the metadata suggesting a focus on relaxation and stress relief. The title 'Regulate Your Nervous System' and phrases from the description such as 'regulating rest and digest practice,' 'soothe symptoms of stress,' and 'nurture the parasympathetic nervous system' strongly imply a calming, restorative purpose. The emphasis on using yoga to 'cultivate a sense of safety and grounding' and 'release self-judgment by practicing self-compassion' further underscores this. User comments also reflect a soothing experience denoting an 'energetic reset' and relief from anxiety and stress.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is assigned a score of 0.65 as there are elements of rhythmic movement involved in the yoga practice. Tags such as '15 minute yoga flow' and comments about using the breath and feeling good after the yoga practice indicate a gentle, flowing sequence typical of yoga, which often integrates movement with breath in a rhythmic way. The yoga's structured nature also contributes slightly to this score but is not the main focus here."
