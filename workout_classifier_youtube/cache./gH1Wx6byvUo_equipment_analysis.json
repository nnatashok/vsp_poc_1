  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"5 min Morning Yoga Stretches in Bed\" from the \"Yoga with Kassandra\" channel describes a yoga routine intended to be performed in bed, as indicated in both the title and description. The tags such as \"stretches in bed\" and \"morning yoga in bed\" further reinforce this. The description explicitly states that this is a quick morning yoga flow that can be done before getting out of bed, and no specific equipment like a mat or blocks is mentioned as being needed. Therefore, it is highly likely that the workout is a bodyweight-only routine, designed to be performed using the bed itself as the surface. As such, no external equipment is required for this workout, and the primary tool is the bed itself, which is not considered standard fitness equipment."
