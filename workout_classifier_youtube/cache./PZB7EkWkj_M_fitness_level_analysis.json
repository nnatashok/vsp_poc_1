  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video primarily features a Vinyasa yoga flow, which involves moderately complex movements requiring coordination and balance, especially with emphasis on balance, flexibility, and strength. The description highlights hip and shoulder opening, typical of intermediate-level techniques. While the movements may include advanced elements, there's no mention of specific advanced or expert techniques, which suggests the flow accommodates intermediate levels primarily, with some advanced aspects.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is almost 48 minutes long, contributing to moderate to challenging difficulty due to duration alone. It also focuses on full-body yoga flow aimed at flexibility, balance, and strength, which suggests a moderate to challenging energy expenditure. The description and user comments indicate some physical demand, but it primarily emphasizes the feel-good, therapeutic nature, which aligns more with moderate effort but accounts for challenge due to length and balance work.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level should be intermediate to advanced, as the technique involves intermediate-level coordination and stabilization, while the duration and effort inherent in a full-body flow suggest significant endurance. The relatively high duration of nearly 48 minutes also shifts the requirement towards advanced for the stamina needed, yet the absence of highly complex movements keeps it accessible to intermediate practitioners."
