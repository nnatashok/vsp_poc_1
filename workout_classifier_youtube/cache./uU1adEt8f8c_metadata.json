    "Thanks Kitaro. These new relaxing Breathing methods are more effective for me than the Wim Hoff 5 rounds. The effects are more intense and your instructions calming. It\u2019s very easy to remain totally focused. I\u2019m using this  now every morning before getting out of bed. My days start with joy. \u2764",
