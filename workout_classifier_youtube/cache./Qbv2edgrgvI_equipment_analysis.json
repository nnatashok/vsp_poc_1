  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video explicitly mentions the use of dumbbells in both the title and description, indicating that this is a weight training workout. The description mentions the use of '5-pound weights,' which are a form of light dumbbells, and encourages viewers to use whatever weights they are comfortable with. The tags also include 'dumbbell workout,' 'workout with weights,' and 'weight training,' all implying the central role of dumbbells in this workout. Additionally, no other supporting equipment is referenced in the metadata, which strongly suggests that the primary equipment necessary are dumbbells, justifying a high confidence score of 0.9."
