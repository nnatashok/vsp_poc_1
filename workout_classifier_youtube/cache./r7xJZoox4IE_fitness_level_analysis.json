  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of simple exercises like 'Feet Slide & Scissor Arms', 'Glute Bridge Forward March', and 'Lying Star Legs', which are generally low complexity and easy to follow, aligning well with Beginner levels. The inclusion of movements like 'Swimmers' and 'Scissor Kicks' introduces a bit more coordination and core engagement, slightly raising the complexity, which justifies the inclusion of Intermediate at a lower score.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is designed as a 'Lazy Girl' routine, explicitly low impact and no jumping, indicating it targets low energy expenditure. The 10-minute duration with exercise names that are not typically demanding (e.g., 'Hip Tappers', 'Slow Leg Lifts') supports a Light effort. However, given the full body involvement, Moderate can be considered, especially for deconditioned users. User comments reflect it as manageable but not exertive.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the low complexity and light effort required by the workout, it fits perfectly with Beginner fitness levels. However, the moderate energy workout characteristics and some slight complexity in exercises justify the inclusion of Intermediate at a lower score. The metadata confirms this workout is well-suited for less motivated and less physically conditioned individuals."
