  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled '30 MIN MORNING PILATES || Full Body Mat Pilates Workout (Moderate)' clearly specifies 'Mat' Pilates in both the title and description, indicating that a mat is central to the workout. The description contains a specific call-out to a mat with a promotional link, which confirms its essential role. The tags also include 'at home pilates workout no equipment,' implying that after the mat, no other equipment is necessary. Thus, I am very confident in assigning a 0.9 confidence score for requiring a mat, as it is the primary equipment explicitly mentioned and central to a Pilates workout like this one."
