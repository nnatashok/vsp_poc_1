  "categoriesConfidence": 0.85,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Meditation' with a high confidence score of 0.9, as the title and tags prominently feature 'guided meditation,' 'meditation for sleep,' and 'insomnia meditation,' indicating that the video is centered around meditative practices. The detailed description of the video as facilitating 'deep, restful sleep' through relaxation techniques further supports this categorization. 'Yoga' is assigned a score of 0.7 because the practice 'Yoga Nidra' is a specialized form of yoga that focuses on mindfulness and deep relaxation, evident from repeated mentions in the title, tags, and comments. 'Breathing exercises' is considered with a lower score of 0.4, as the intended relaxation and sleep aid effects typically involve controlled breathing, although not explicitly highlighted, it's an implicit part of Yoga Nidra practice. The confidence in these categories is very high due to the clear alignment of metadata with the intended outcomes of meditation and relaxation."
