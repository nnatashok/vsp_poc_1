  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata from the video strongly indicates a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The title 'LET GO of Anxiety, Fear & Worries: A GUIDED MEDITATION' directly suggests a focus on emotional healing and relaxation. The description emphasizes releasing anxiety, achieving harmony, and obtaining inner peace, all of which are core aspects of a soothing and restorative experience. The tags such as 'inner peace meditation' and 'emotional healing' further strengthen this classification.\n\nComments underscore the impact of the meditation on emotional well-being, with viewers sharing experiences of relief and comfort. These elements collectively justify a score of 1 for the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to the direct correlation with the video's intent and content.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant, although less dominantly. References to harmony and music tuned to 432Hz, along with binaural beats, imply a rhythmic element to the session. This justifies a mild score of 0.5, as these elements contribute to a smooth, flowing experience.\n\nThe absence of high-energy, structured formats, or sports-related content justifies excluding other spirits."
