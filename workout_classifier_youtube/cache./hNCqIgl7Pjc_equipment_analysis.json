  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"10 Minute Stretching - FULL BODY -Stress Relief & Recovery\" does not explicitly mention the need for any workout equipment. The description highlights the purpose of the stretching routine for muscle recovery and stress relief, suitable for post-workout or active recovery. The tags and description emphasize aspects like 'stretch,' 'yoga,' and 'fullbodystretch,' suggesting that it is likely a bodyweight stretching routine without equipment requirements. The tips section in the description mentions breathing techniques and core engagement but does not suggest any equipment use. Additionally, user comments focus on the effectiveness of the routine without mentioning equipment, confirming that the workout can be completed bodyweight-only. Therefore, it appears this routine is designed to be performed without any equipment, or at most, on the floor or a functional surface, which is typical for stretching workouts."
