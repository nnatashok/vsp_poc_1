  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a morning breathwork routine, involving calming breathing techniques with a focus on relaxation and meditation rather than physical exertion. The short duration of 12 minutes and user comments stating the routine is simple and easy suggest it is low in physical demand. No high energy expenditure activities are indicated, making the effort difficulty light.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level aligns primarily with beginners due to the simple nature of the exercises and the low physical demand. The metadata, including the tags and description, targets beginners explicitly (e.g., 'guided breathwork for beginners'). However, regular practice could also suit an intermediate level user who is exploring mindfulness and breath control, along with the psychological benefits mentioned, allowing this level a secondary fit. The technique difficulty and effort difficulty being light further validate the predominant relevance for beginners, with a minor overlap into the intermediate range when considering mental self-regulation benefits."
