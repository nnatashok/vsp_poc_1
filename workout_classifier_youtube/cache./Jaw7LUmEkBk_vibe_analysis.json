  "vibesExplanation": "The video focuses on hip mobility and flexibility, indicated by the title and multiple references in the tags such as 'hip mobility exercises,' 'hip flexibility,' and 'leg day warm up.' This suggests a 'Foundation Builder' vibe, which emphasizes strengthening weak points and perfecting basics, making it a strong match with a score of 0.9. The short, gentle nature of the workout also aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, as it focuses on refreshing and stretching the body, which justifies a score of 0.7. Comments supporting increased flexibility and reduced pain further reinforce these vibes. The moderate intensity and brief duration exclude more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Endorphin Wave.' Overall, there's high confidence due to strong alignment with the video\u2019s focus on foundational and restorative qualities."
