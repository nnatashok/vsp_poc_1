  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a very high score of 0.9. This is strongly indicated by the emphasis on stretching, which is generally recognized for its restorative benefits, helping with recovery and relaxation. The description and tags like '5 min daily stretch,' 'cool down,' and 'full body stretch' clearly support this classification, as they underscore the gentle and recovery-oriented nature of the workout. The users' comments mentioning the pleasant sensation of stretching further underscore its restorative qualities. The secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm,' receives a score of 0.5, indicating a moderate match. This is suggested by the structure of the routine being presented as 'smooth and continuous,' as mentioned in user comments appreciating the clear, straightforward flow and the timer aiding focus on rhythm. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the absence of high intensity or athletic performance language."
