  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as 'beginner' and uses foundational movements like push-ups, tricep dips, and planks, which are generally beginner-friendly in terms of complexity. However, the inclusion of bodyweight control exercises like Cobra Push Ups and movements requiring coordination and strength suggest a low to moderate intermediate technique difficulty. Comments indicate users find the exercises approachable but somewhat challenging, indicating a blend of beginner and intermediate techniques.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "While the workout is part of a 'beginner series,' the duration and feedback suggest it can be demanding, especially for untrained individuals. Therefore, it's suitable for motivated beginners who are ready to challenge themselves, as well as intermediates. The need for pauses and progression from wall push-ups indicate that even those with some experience find it valuable, thus also skirting into the advanced territory at lower scores. Video description and comments underscore the workout's aim for progress towards more advanced routines, supporting a classification across these fitness levels."
