  "spiritsExplanation": "The title and description of the video emphasize 'Cardio Pilates,' highlighting both rhythmic movement and cardiovascular elements. The phrase 'cardio flows' suggests a significant component of 'Flow & Rhythm,' further supported by the music-driven nature of the session, which aligns with this spirit. The description also mentions a 'full body workout,' and combining 'Pilates principles' indicates a 'Structured & Disciplined' approach, typical of Pilates' focus on technique and form. Additionally, user comments frequently highlight enjoying the 'flow and breathing' of the workout, reinforcing its rhythmic and structured qualities. The workout offers both 'low impact and high impact' options, suggesting a degree of intensity and adaptability, aligning with a slightly less pronounced 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The clear methodology and precision in movement characteristic of Pilates further justify the structured nature of the routine. Overall, the spirits are assigned with high confidence due to the explicit cues in the metadata."
