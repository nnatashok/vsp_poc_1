  "vibesExplanation": "The video primarily fits \"The Warrior Workout\" vibe due to its description of high intensity, full-body movements, and emphasis on sweating and reaching one's limits, as seen in phrases like \"killer High Intensity routine\" and \"super intense full body movements.\" The duration (10 min) and mention of exhausted yet empowering workout align it with this category, earning a score of 0.7.\n\n\"The Firestarter\" vibe is also fitting due to the workout being short and intense, described as \"HIGHLY EFFECTIVE\" and delivering a \"high heart rate non-stop\" experience, indicative of a fast-paced, explosive nature. This earns it a score of 0.6.\n\n\"The Rhythmic Powerhouse\" is a less strong but plausible vibe due to the mention of a great music playlist, which can elevate the workout experience to being music-infused and energetic, albeit with less emphasis on rhythm than on intensity. This results in a score of 0.4.\n\nOther vibes like \"The Nightclub Workout\" or \"The Endorphin Wave\" were considered but ultimately excluded due to the emphasis on intensity over musical rhythm immersion or a steady energy build typical of longer durations."
