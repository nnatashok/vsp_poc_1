  "vibesExplanation": "The workout title and description emphasize a challenging but bodyweight-focused approach to targeting glutes and hamstrings. Key phrases like \"intense session,\" \"no rest,\" and \"challenging\" align well with **The Warrior Workout** vibe, suggesting a vigorous and demanding workout, appropriate for a 45-minute session with described intensity (score 0.7).\n\nThe structured format with \"giant sets\" and the progression from unilateral movements to more complex holds indicates a **Progression Quest** vibe as well, focusing on methodical advancement and technique, aiming for long-term glute and hamstring development (score 0.6).\n\nFinally, the workout's disciplined nature, requiring focus and a \"mind to muscle connection,\" plus the emphasis on correct form and control, fits **The Disciplined Grind** vibe. Comments about its effectiveness and necessity of pushing through difficulty also support this classification (score 0.6).\n\nWhile there's a strong focus on technique, which could hint at a Masterclass vibe, the intensity and endurance elements make the aforementioned vibes a better fit."
