  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video involves specific breathing techniques that include deep circular breathing, breath holds of up to 3 minutes, and a structured breathing pattern across 5 rounds. This requires some advanced level control of breath and awareness, but it is not as complex in terms of physical coordination as movements might be in other advanced techniques like complex yoga. Therefore, it's moderately complex but not overly technical, fitting mainly into the Intermediate range with some Advanced elements due to prolonged breath holds.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Effort is moderate based on the breath retention challenge and the duration of the session. Holding a breath for up to 3 minutes requires significant control and can be strenuous, pushing the workout towards challenging for those less familiar with breathwork. The effort level is higher than typical relaxation techniques due to extended breath holds which can increase energy expenditure and mental focus required, hence scored between Moderate and Challenging.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the intermediate to advanced technique difficulty of structured breathing and the moderate to challenging effort required for prolonged breath holds, this session is most suitable for those with some prior experience in breath control, thus aligning with Intermediate and Advanced fitness levels. For a deconditioned audience, managing 3-minute holds might be difficult, qualifying this more firmly within those mid to higher experience brackets."
