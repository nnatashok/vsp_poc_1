    "READ FIRST:<br>For activating sessions like this, it is always recommended to lay down in a safe and comfortable environment. The intention behind all of these breathwork experiences that I create is to facilitate the experience of deep states of gratitude. Sometimes, we need to clear the clutter in the mind and body to make space for these elevated emotions like joy and gratitude. Thats where these activating sessions can help.<br><br>If, during any breathwork session, you feel emotions coming to the surface, allow yourself to fully experience and feel all of them\u2014the lows and the highs. This process moves you out of suppression and depression and into gratitude and expression.<br><br>Much love to all,<br>Sandy",
    "I did this exercise believing I was going to release some negative emotions, my intention was to get rid of something painful... Can you believe the stuck emotion in me was GRATITUDE?! I&#39;m in tears right now, the most grateful, most beautiful cry I have ever experienced! I am so grateful for my Higher Power and all the beings on my journey who have helped me CURE my addiction, I am forever grateful for my experience on earth, the love I feel within me is unlike anything I have ever experienced! I felt like I was going to start speaking another language, I am not even kidding you, some language I somehow knew was to communicate with God and the higher realms, oh my gosh, so much gratitude.... I&#39;ve been doing breathwork everyday for just a couple weeks and it&#39;s something I will continue doing the rest of my life. You mean to tell me all I had to do was replace my drug use with meditation, prayer and breath work? Thank you for all the hard work you and your team have put into this channel and your dreams, it&#39;s inspiring me to do the same! \u2764<br>I had to also add that it felt like my feet, head and hands were larger than my body and my chakras, they felt lit up, It felt like I was floating... What the heck just happened, lol, I love my Recovery journey! <br>For anyone reading this, find what activates you, stop focusing on what triggers you and instead focus on how you can activate your sense of wellbeing and wholeness, it does exist and it is waiting for you!",
    "I no longer feel myself if I don\u2019t start and end the day breathing with Sandy. You have perfected the instructional video format and you bring so much peace to the world. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f",
    "After one round, I was energised. After 2-4 minutes, I lay down and was listening to Rumi and started crying because of hurt to my heart that family had caused. That was the first time in over a decade that i had cried. I felt such a release of tension and felt more loving to myself and others.",
    "Now i understand why they call this type of breathing psychedelic, by half of the breath work i went into straight psychedelic mode, i felt a tingling sensation all over my body and could feel my brain and every cell in my body being oxygenated and regenerated with every breath, once i finished i just felt this tremendous harmony and peace in and out. Thank You very very much. God bless \ud83d\ude4f"
