  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"Letting Go so You Can Move Forward (Guided Meditation)\" is a guided meditation session provided by the Great Meditation channel. Based on the metadata provided, including the title, description, tags, and the nature of the channel, the video appears to be focused entirely on meditation and mental relaxation without physical exercise components. There is no mention of any physical exercise equipment in the title, description, or tags, and the comments further corroborate the focus on emotional and mental well-being rather than physical activity. Therefore, this video does not require any physical equipment and is likely to be a bodyweight-only meditation session where listeners might simply be asked to sit or lie down in a comfortable position, often on the floor or in a chair. As such, there is no specific equipment required, and the workout appears to be bodyweight only."
