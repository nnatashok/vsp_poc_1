  "categoriesExplanation": "The video titled 'Guided Breathing: Awaken Your Nervous System' is strongly indicative of a breathing exercises category, supported by the explicit mention of breathwork in the title and description. The channel, Kitaro Waga, specializes in guided breathwork, as evidenced by the description and top comments. The content's focus, as noted both in the video description and user comments, is on guiding viewers through breathing exercises, making 'Breathing exercises' the primary category with a score of 1.\n\nAdditionally, there is moderate evidence for classifying the video under 'Meditation.' The mention of incorporating 'guided breathing meditation' by a top comment suggests the video may incorporate meditative elements, albeit as a secondary aspect. Therefore, 'Meditation' is given a supporting score of 0.5 based on these comments and context from the video structure where breathwork can often overlap with meditative practices."
