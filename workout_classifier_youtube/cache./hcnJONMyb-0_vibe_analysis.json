  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe is 'The Foundation Builder' due to the video's emphasis on creating a solid foundation for beginners in calisthenics. The title explicitly states 'For Beginners' and the description highlights 'building a base and a solid foundation'. This matches the 'Foundation Builder' theme, meriting a strong score of 0.9. \n\nThe 'Progression Quest' vibe also fits, as the description talks about the potential for more advanced exercises in the future, and this workout is positioned as a starting point in a calisthenics journey. This suggests incremental improvement, scoring 0.7. \n\nAdditionally, the workout could somewhat embody 'The Reboot Workout', given its low equipment nature and focus on starting afresh with simple calisthenics moves, suggesting a mild physical refresh quality, earning it a 0.4 score.\n\nThe confidence for these classifications is high due to explicit textual indicators aligning with the defined vibes categories. Other potential vibes were considered less relevant due to lack of high-intensity or specific music-driven elements."
