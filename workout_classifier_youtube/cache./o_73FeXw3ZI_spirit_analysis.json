  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit for this workout, 'Flow & Rhythm,' is evident from the emphasis on continuous, coordinated movement patterns typically associated with 'vinyasa flow' and 'yoga flow,' as seen in the tags and description. The channel name 'Breathe and Flow' also highlights a focus on fluidity and a mind-body connection, indicating a high confidence level of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is relevant given the video's purpose as a 'morning routine' aimed at easing individuals into their day with gentle yet engaging yoga practices. The user's comments about closing eyes and mental stillness reinforce a soothing quality, thus scoring 0.8.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the lack of high-intensity descriptors and athletic performance focus. The description's reference to \u2018all levels\u2019 and functional movement indicates accessibility and a relaxation focus, not high-intensity challenges. The structured nature of yoga and its foundational role in the channel's ethos further supports the first two spirits identified."
