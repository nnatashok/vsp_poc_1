  "vibesExplanation": "The video's focus on deep breathing exercises strongly aligns with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe, which is characterized by nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement. This is supported by phrases like 'reduce anxiety, stress, fatigue' and user comments noting its effectiveness for relaxation and managing anxiety, with one user mentioning its usefulness during panic attacks. The high viewership and positive feedback suggest it is a well-received resource for calming purposes, justifying a high score of 0.8.\n\nMeanwhile, 'The Reboot Workout' is also relevant since the video is used by viewers for relaxation after workouts, addressing stress and physical discomfort\u2014traits that fit the vibe's score of 0.7. However, the video's lack of physical movement limits its alignment with more physically demanding or skill-centric vibes. Overall, the evidence from the title, description, and comments provides a high confidence classification of these vibes."
