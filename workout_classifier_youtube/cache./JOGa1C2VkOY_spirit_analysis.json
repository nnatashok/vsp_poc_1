  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout spirit analysis suggests a strong presence of \"Structured & Disciplined,\" supported by phrases such as \"calisthenics workout for beginners\" and \"every exercise can be regressed,\" which imply a methodical approach catering to varying fitness levels. The inclusion of specific exercises like pull-ups, leg raises, and precise reps indicates a disciplined protocol. This spirit gets a score of 0.75, reflecting its well-defined structure and target audience.\n\n\"Sport & Agility\" is also relevant as calisthenics is often linked to improving athletic performance, coordination, and body control, all of which are hinted at through terms like \"street workout exercises\" and the channel's focus on creating \"athletes.\" This spirit scores 0.65, as the workout emphasizes basics suitable for building foundation agility.\n\n\"High-Energy & Intense\" is included with a score of 0.5; comments from users who mention the challenge and the phrase \"10 MIN Full Body\" suggest a potentially demanding session despite its beginner label, though it is not the primary focus.\n\nOther spirits such as \"Flow & Rhythm,\" \"Soothing & Restorative,\" and \"Outdoor & Adventure\" were not emphasized in the metadata, as the workout appears indoor-centric and result-focused without a restorative or purely rhythmic aim."
