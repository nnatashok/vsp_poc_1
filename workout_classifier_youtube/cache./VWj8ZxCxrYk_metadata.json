    "Guys, if you feel like giving up don\u2019t because after 5 days of doing this I can do it nonstop with no breaks and it feels so good. Also after doing this I felt more productive and happy.",
    "My whole body is burning, my legs are shaking, my asthma said no and I took breaks, BUT I DID IT AND I FEEL AMAZING, good things you can&#39;t hear us because I threw some hate in there but thank you so much for this, I loved it.",
    "i\u2019ve been doing this workout consistently for 1 week and in the beginning i was only able to do 5 mins. it was kind of discouraging, ngl but i kept in mind that i am just a beginner and it takes some time to get used to. today i was able to get through the whole 15 mins!! \ud83d\ude0a so to anyone in the comments thinking of giving up, DON\u2019T. keep going, u got this \ud83d\udc96",
    "Had 5 strokes 10 heart attacks and went into 2 cardiac arrests during this workout but I finished"
