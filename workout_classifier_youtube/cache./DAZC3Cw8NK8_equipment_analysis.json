  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video, titled '21-MIN FLUID WORKOUT FOR WEIGHT LOSS - NO JUMPING, NO REPEATS,' explicitly states that no equipment is necessary. The description and channel information emphasize that the workout can be done at home without equipment, focusing on bodyweight exercises. The description lists exercises such as body rotations, torso twists, and lunges, which are typically performed without equipment. Additionally, the channel is known for bodyweight workouts, and no comments or tags suggest the use of any specific equipment. Thus, it appears to be a bodyweight-only workout."
