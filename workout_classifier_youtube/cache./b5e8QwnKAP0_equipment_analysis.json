  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Guided 100 Push Up Workout!' by Jordan Yeoh Fitness focuses specifically on push-up exercises as detailed in the title and supported by comments focusing on push-up variations like standard, wide, and clapping push-ups. The description does not mention any specific equipment, suggesting the workout is bodyweight-focused. Furthermore, comments from viewers highlight the challenge of different push-up types without referring to any physical equipment used to complete the exercises. Thus, no equipment is needed for this workout, as it focuses entirely on bodyweight exercises."
