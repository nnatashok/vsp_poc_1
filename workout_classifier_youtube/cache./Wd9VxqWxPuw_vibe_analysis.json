  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified is 'The Endorphin Wave' with a strong score of 0.8. This is supported by phrases like 'fat burning,' 'heart rate pumping,' and 'boost your metabolism' from the description, indicating a steady-state cardio workout that gradually builds energy and endurance. The use of intervals also implies a structured intensity that aligns with sustained energetic outputs.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Meditative Grind' is also relevant here, with a score of 0.6. Indoor cycling often involves rhythmic, repetitive movement which allows users to 'zone in,' as supported by commenters who repeatedly use this workout, like Comment 1, indicating a habitual, almost meditative return to this workout routine. \n\nOther workout vibes such as 'The Firestarter' are less applicable due to the lack of extreme short-burst intensity and explosive elements described in the metadata. Similarly, while music is involved, it plays a background role, which does not strongly indicate 'The Nightclub Workout.' Therefore, these vibes were excluded."
