  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is centered around indoor cycling, as indicated by the title \"15 Minute Workout - Best Indoor Cycling Training Cardio Session\". The description explicitly mentions using a \"turbo trainer\" for the workout, which is a type of stationary cycling equipment. The tags such as \"indoor cycling\", \"home trainer\", and \"turbo-training\" further reinforce the requirement for an exercise bike or turbo trainer. The comments from users, particularly mentioning \"spin bike\" and the effective session using a home trainer, also suggest the necessity of an exercise bike to perform the workout. Given this evidence, there is very high confidence (0.9) that an exercise bike or equivalent indoor cycling equipment is required to perform this workout effectively."
