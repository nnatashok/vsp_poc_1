  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled \"5 min Yoga Break: Reset & Find Calm\" aligns most strongly with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as evidenced by the title, description, and tags focusing on stress relief, mental health, calming, and relaxation. The references to deep breathing, tension release, and gentle stretches such as hamstring and reclining twists depict a session intended for restoration and relaxation, earning it a very high match score of 0.9.\n\nFurthermore, there is a moderate presence of the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, with the video structure suggesting a progression through smooth and continuous motions, though it's primarily focused on relaxation rather than a music-driven pace, leading to a score of 0.4.\n\nThe metadata does not support other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' due to the absence of indicators of intense physical exertion or performance-based training."
