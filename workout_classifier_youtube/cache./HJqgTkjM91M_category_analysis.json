  "categoriesExplanation": "The video titled 'Guided Meditation with Mooji \u2014 Just Be!' and hosted on the channel 'Moojiji' strongly suggests that the primary focus is meditation. The title explicitly mentions 'Guided Meditation,' and the description discusses a 'guided exercise for abiding in the natural state of Beingness.' These phrases indicate a directed meditation session. The frequent use of terms like 'awareness,' 'self-realization,' and 'non-dual Awareness' positions this content as a meditative and introspective exercise. Additionally, the tags include 'meditation,' further confirming this category. The channel description and related content also emphasize themes of self-realization and awareness, aligning well with meditation practices. The confidence is very high at 0.9 because of these explicit indications of meditation as the primary focus."
