  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'A Powerful 20 Minute Guided Meditation' clearly embodies 'The Zen Flow' vibe, as it emphasizes grounding, intentional, and breath-centered meditation. The title, description, and frequent use of terms like 'guided meditation,' 'feel your presence,' and 'powerful way' suggest a focus on mindfulness and presence, aligning it with a Zen-like experience. This gives 'The Zen Flow' a strong score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the video captures elements of 'The Deep Recharge' vibe. The focus on meditation and a peaceful state aligns with a deep nervous system reset and gentle movement. The serene nature of guided meditation used to reach a calm and restorative state fits well under 'The Deep Recharge,' earning a score of 0.75.\n\nOther vibes such as 'The Reboot Workout' or 'The Sleep Prep' were considered but excluded due to the absence of specific stretching or bedtime elements.
