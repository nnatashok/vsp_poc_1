    "I love your style of workout instruction. You are calm, relaxed, and say just enough so we know what we are doing. This is the style I need! I get so overwhelmed by instructors who scream and shout. Thank you for what you do! You&#39;re a total pro!",
    "I&#39;m 61 years old.  I&#39;ve been doing your workouts for 6 months and I have lost 10 pounds and many inches.  This is the best workout series for me!!!",
    "I am almost 2 months post-op (pre-cancerous skin removal) and this took me 45 minutes to complete with some modifications but I did it!! Feels good to be back \ud83d\ude0a",
    "I\u2019m a mama of 3 who\u2019s cured all my chronic pain issues with home workouts. I so appreciate these workouts! \ud83d\udc4f",
    "The first half of this year was the hardest for my body. My eating disorder took over, and because of that, I lost all strength and ability to do most things. I powered as hard as i could through these workouts but neglected not only myself but my form, too. I finally got my weight back to a healthy point, I am stronger than ever and decided to revisit this with the body and mindset i have today as opposed to 5 months ago when this video dropped. TLDR: I finished this in tears, and it is officially my new favorite. It confirms my new mentality: strength, both mentally and physically, means far more than the way I look. Thanks so much for being part of my health journey, and thanks for bringing us along with you through yours, Maddie. 10 out 10 woman, trainer, and workouts."
