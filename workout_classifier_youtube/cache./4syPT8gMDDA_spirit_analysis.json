  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a very high confidence of 0.9. This is evidenced by the title, 'Guided Meditation for Pelvic Floor Relaxation,' and the repeated emphasis on 'relaxation,' 'unwind,' and 'release pelvic tension' in the description and tags. The video aims to reduce stress and promote healing, which aligns with this spirit. The channel's focus on 'pelvic wellness' and the instructor's approach to provide 'gentle and healing-focused' content further supports this classification. \n\nA secondary spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm' is moderately present with a score of 0.4. The guided meditation's structured delivery may involve rhythmic breathing or pacing that engages the mind-body connection, a characteristic of this spirit. User comments about the emotional release and feelings of 'warmth and expansion' suggest an element of rhythmic engagement, although the primary focus is soothing. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the lack of intensity and rigid structure inherent to meditative practices. There's no evidence of 'Sport & Agility' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' given the indoor, relaxation-focused nature of the workout."
