  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly labeled as a '15 Min Intense HIIT Workout', which aligns with both 'The Warrior Workout' and 'The Firestarter' vibes due to the high intensity and intense interval training format. The description emphasizes its high cardio intensity and variety, supporting 'The Warrior Workout' vibe with a score of 0.75 because it involves sweat-dripping effort and primal energy for an intensive full-body experience. The absence of repeats and the short duration of 15 minutes strongly indicate a 'Firestarter' vibe, known for fast, explosive workouts with a score of 0.7. The tags 'high intensity', 'burn fat fast', and 'no repeats' further reinforce these vibes. Comments discussing the transformative impact and heart rate challenge underscore the intense nature of the session. Therefore, the combination of intensity description, workout structure, and user testimonials supports a high confidence level of 0.9 in these classifications. Other vibes were excluded because there were no strong indications of rhythmic, meditative, or choreography-driven elements in the metadata."
