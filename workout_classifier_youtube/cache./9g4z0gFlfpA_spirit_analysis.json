  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit scores highly (0.8) due to the workout's emphasis on gentle, feel-good movements aimed at waking up the body without intense exertion, highlighted by phrases like 'not too intense,' 'wake up and stay in your pyjamas,' and 'no jumping or difficult exercises' from the description. This aligns with the workout's purpose of promoting a stress-free start to the day, as corroborated by comments noting the workout as 'gentle yet heart-pumping' and suitable for those new to exercise or needing a mood boost. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit also scores well (0.7), given the smooth transitions between exercises (e.g., 'Squat side reach,' 'Good mornings') and the structured but relaxed pacing designed to fit a morning routine, as indicated by tags like 'morning routine' and 'morning exercises.' The overall intent to boost mood and energy supports a flow-centric approach. While the workout has a physical activation element as noted by comments on elevated heart rate, it does not fit 'High-Energy & Intense' due to its beginner-friendly design and absence of intense movements."
