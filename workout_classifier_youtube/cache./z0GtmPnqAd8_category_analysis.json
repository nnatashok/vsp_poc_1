  "categoriesExplanation": "The metadata for the video titled \"15 Minute Guided Meditation | Strength & Grounding In Stressful Times\" strongly indicates its primary focus is on meditation. The title explicitly mentions 'Guided Meditation', which is reinforced by multiple tags such as 'guided meditation', 'meditation for stress', and 'mind meditation'. The description further details it as a '15 minute meditation for strength and grounding' designed to help alleviate anxiety and stress, suggesting a strong meditation component with a score of 1. \n\nThe secondary category of 'Breathing exercises' was considered with a score of 0.4 due to the nature of meditative practices often involving controlled breathing to achieve relaxation, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the title or tags. The emphasis is primarily on meditation, not breathing exercises specifically. Hence the higher confidence and score for Meditation and a lower score for Breathing exercises due to implicit associations."
