  "vibesExplanation": "The video's emphasis on a \"peaceful state\" through \"breathing meditation\" strongly aligns with 'The Zen Flow,' which is characterized by grounding, intentional, breath-centered, unhurried movement. The title and description use terms like \"guided meditation,\" \"peaceful state,\" and \"heighten mindfulness,\" all signifying a focus on calmness and breath, supporting the choice of this vibe. With a score of 0.9, there's high confidence due to the explicit focus on breath and mindfulness.\n\nAdditionally, elements of 'The Deep Recharge' are present as the practice involves a \"nervous system reset\" through \"mindfulness and clarity of the mind,\" indicating gentle mental restoration. Although less dominant, with a score of 0.7, this vibe is evident through user comments highlighting the calming, cooling, and refreshing effects of the meditation practice.\n\nThe content lacks the intensity or structured movement of vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Groove Session,' thus excluding those. The primary focus on calmness and breath alignment with the metadata makes these chosen vibes highly suitable."
