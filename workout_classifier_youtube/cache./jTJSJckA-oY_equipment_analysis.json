  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a guided meditation session focusing on breathing and deep relaxation. No explicit equipment is mentioned in the title, description, or tags that suggests the use of traditional exercise or fitness equipment. The description provides options for sitting or lying down positions which might involve using a cushion or pillow for comfort, but these are not classified as exercise equipment per the given schema. Therefore, it appears that the video is designed to be performed bodyweight only, with no additional equipment required for effective participation."
