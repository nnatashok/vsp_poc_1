  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Yoga' with a high score of 0.9, due to the explicit mention of 'yoga' in the title, tags, and description, such as '30 min Yoga for Weight Loss', 'yoga for weight loss', and 'yoga workout'. The video is part of a series of yoga videos by a channel specialized in yoga and pilates content, further substantiated by user comments indicating a focus on yoga practice. The secondary category 'Weight workout' is included with a score of 0.5 as the video is described as a 'Fat Burning Workout', suggesting an emphasis on weight loss and fat-burning, typically associated with physical exertion or calorie-burning exercises. While the video likely includes yoga postures aimed at increasing heart rate for weight management, the 'Weight workout' category is less emphasized compared to the strong presence of yoga, reflected in the moderate score. The focus is on yoga rather than traditional weightlifting or resistance equipment, excluding other categories such as 'HIIT' or 'Body weight'."
