  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized primarily as a 'Mat' workout due to the nature of exercises such as 'plank walk out to push up', 'plank lean to crouch', 'squat walk to squat', and the absence of jumping or equipment, supporting a score of 0.9. This category is indicated by the low-impact, body-weight exercises mentioned in the title and description, emphasizing the use of an exercise mat. Additionally, the 'Cardio' category received a 0.7 score because the exercises focus on maintaining a steady cardiovascular effort without high intensity, as highlighted by terms like 'low impact steady state cardio' and 'full body cardio workout'. The description also mentions benefits of low-intensity cardio like mood boosting and energy burning, which aligns with steady-state cardio routines. Despite the potential overlap with HIIT due to the fast-paced nature, the consistent emphasis on 'low impact' and 'steady state' firmly places the workout in a mat-based cardio domain more typical of LISS (low-intensity steady-state) exercises."
