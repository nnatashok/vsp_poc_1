  "title": "Treadmill Setting | Morning Fasted Cardio",
  "description": "Treadmill settings I use on a typical cardio session. How much walking will you need to lose body fat? The fat loss that occurs is due to creating a caloric deficit. Walking improves the body ability to lose body fat through movement and without having to lower calories to a place where health issues may happen. \n\nWhat speed and incline should the treadmill be set at? I start each session slowly especially when I am doing cardio first thing in the morning. I prefer not to eat prior to cardio but that makes no difference for fat loss over a 24 hour period if calories are equal, for me it's just a time when I don't like to eat. \n\nJoin our 90 Day Transformation Challenge\nhttps://www.prophysique.com/transformationchallenge\n\nTreadmill settings morning fasted cardio to lose body fat and get shredded!",

    "Yes!!  I find getting my cardio done before the sun rises sets me up for a better day.  Better mindset, mood, energy, and determination to stick to healthy eating.  Thanks Paul!  Another great video!  Seeing your full day of eating would be cool \ud83d\ude0e",
