    "Thank you so much for this! I do it every morning and it gets easier each time!",
    "Hey y\u2019all. I just wanted to say this in hopes that I can motivate somebody. I was close to giving up after 2 weeks cause I thought I didn\u2019t see any results, but today I looked in the mirror and I do see a difference. It really does creep up on ya! Do not give up! <br>Even if it doesn\u2019t show at first, your body is becoming healthier and stronger and that\u2019s all that matters. <br>You will see a physical difference soon so keep pushing! <br><br>Thank you Sydney for this workout !",
    "I love this workout! I am obese, old and out of shape, but with a few modifications I have been doing this 3x a week for about 8 weeks. I have been adjusting the walking speeds to work with my short legs and out of shape body. Instead of 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 for the interval speeds, I started out at 2.5, 2.8, and 3.0. As I get better I have upped the speeds. I am now at 2.8, 3.1, and 3.4. Any faster than that and I&#39;m jogging. I&#39;m definitely not ready for that yet! I have always walked at an incline of 3 but have worked my way up to 5.  I figure this makes up a little for not doing the higher speeds. Sydney is very encouraging through the whole video and keeps you motivated to make it to the finish!",
    "Walking on the treadmill is usually  tedious and boring, but not with you! You make it go quickly and keep things positive. Now that I found this video, I think I could do this regularly! Thanks for posting stuff for beginners and inspiring confidence in me!",
