  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this video is 'Soothing & Restorative'. Evidence for this classification includes the title \"Guided Meditation (Awakening The Mind)\", which aligns closely with activities designed to be gentle, healing-focused, and relaxing. The description emphasizes providing 'relief from perspective' and 'obtaining self-awareness', further reinforcing the focus on recovery and stress reduction. User comments, such as a therapist sharing the video with clients and mentions of relaxation, support this classification, leading to a very high confidence (score of 0.95) in this spirit.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm', which is suggested by the description mentioning pairing audio with a song that 'syncs nicely with his words', indicating a smooth, coherent movement of sound and thought, which contributes to a sense of rhythm and coordination. However, because the primary focus is meditation and relaxation, the confidence and score for 'Flow & Rhythm' are moderate (score of 0.55).\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to the lack of relevant indicators for intensity, structured exercise, athleticism, or outdoor elements in the video metadata."
