  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout appears to primarily include basic dumbbell exercises such as rows, squats, and tricep extensions. These movements are largely beginner-friendly, especially with options to use lighter weights, which aligns with the target audience of older adults. However, the use of dumbbells and multiple sets introduces a slight need for coordination and balance, placing the technique difficulty level also within the intermediate range.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout spans 29 minutes and uses a format of 45 seconds of work followed by 15 seconds of rest, which matches a moderate effort level, especially when using a lighter dumbbell weight. The mention of a full-body workout, targeting all major muscle groups, and the possibility of heavier weights can make it more challenging, especially for those new to such duration or intensity.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the technique and effort difficulty, the workout caters primarily to beginners and intermediates, given the option to adjust dumbbell weights and the straightforward nature of the exercises. The session length and strength focus mean beginners can find it accessible with lighter weights, while intermediates can opt for increased challenge. Advanced level users might also find some benefit, particularly if they increase the weights for added intensity."
