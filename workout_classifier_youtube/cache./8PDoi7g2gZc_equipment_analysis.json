  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly mentioned as a 'STANDING DUMBBELL WORKOUT' in the video title, description, and tags. The description states, 'All you need is a medium set of dumbbells,' with an emphasis on 8lb weights, but allows for a range of 5-12lb depending on the user's strength level. Additionally, tags like 'dumbbell workout,' 'medium dumbbells,' and '8lb dumbbells' further confirm that dumbbells are central to this workout. There is no mention of any other equipment being required or suggested, leading to a very high confidence score of 1.0 for the requirement of dumbbells."
