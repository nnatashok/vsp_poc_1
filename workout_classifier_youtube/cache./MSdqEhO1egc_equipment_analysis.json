  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a 15-minute Yoga Nidra meditation focused on peace and relaxation. The metadata, including the title, description, tags, and comments, emphasize the meditative and relaxing nature of the session rather than any physical exercise that requires equipment. Yoga Nidra is typically a guided meditation practice where participants lie down and follow verbal instructions, often in a comfortable position. There is no mention of any specific fitness equipment in the metadata. Therefore, it can be concluded with high confidence that this is a bodyweight-only session, primarily involving lying down in a comfortable position. While a mat could potentially enhance comfort, it is not explicitly mentioned or necessary based on the video content described."
