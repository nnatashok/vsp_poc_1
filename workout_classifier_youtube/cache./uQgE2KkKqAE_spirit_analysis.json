  "spiritsExplanation": "The dominant spirit of the video is 'Soothing & Restorative' as evidenced by the title mentioning 'Stress & Anxiety,' the focus on calm and relaxation in the description, and the tags like 'calming breathing exercises' and 'guided breathing meditation.' This classification is assigned a high confidence level (0.9) because of the clear intention to alleviate stress and promote healing. Additionally, user comments reinforce the restorative impact of the exercise on individuals experiencing various conditions.\n\nThe second spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' supported by the rhythmic nature of the breathing exercises and the music mentioned in the channel description. The creator emphasizes the integration of rhythmic music into each session, indicating some element of flow in the practice. This spirit receives a moderate score (0.6) as the video incorporates smooth, continuous, and music-driven breathing patterns despite lacking more explicit movement-based flow elements. Other potential spirits were excluded due to the indoor, calm, and non-intense nature of the workout, which aligns more with restorative practices than high-energy or disciplined ones."
