  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled \"5 min Yoga Break: Reset & Find Calm\" which suggests a yoga session. In the description, it mentions activities such as 'Lie down & settle in,' 'Lower back stretch in wind pose,' and 'Relaxing twist,' which typically require a stable surface for comfort and support, strongly implying the use of a yoga mat. Additionally, the channel is focused on yoga, and the resources at the end mention yoga mats. Given these factors, the use of a mat is crucial, leading to a very high confidence score of 0.9. No other equipment is suggested or implied in the metadata, indicating a bodyweight focus beyond the mat."
