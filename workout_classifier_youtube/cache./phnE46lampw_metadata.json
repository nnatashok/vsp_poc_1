  "description": "When you are sore, tired and just want to rest, its most likely the best idea for your body! Getting a stretch in can help you speed up your recovery process and help your muscles elongate so that when you are working out you are getting proper (and full) range of motion in your exercises\n\nStretching daily can also be a form of self care and can help increase mobility and decrease back, knee, and shoulder pain.\n\nIf you are experiencing intense pain, that is not normal, please consult your doctor or physiotherapist before proceeding with exercise or even stretches.\n\nDuring todays stretch, I want you to focus on breathing in confidence and breathing out doubt. Take nice deep breaths, and take your time with the stretches. This is a moment for you to recollect your thoughts, enjoy the music, and give your body the love it deserves.\n\nIf you have the extra time to do this before bed or first thing when you wake up in the morning, you will for see a noticeable difference in your energy levels, in your recovery time, and the effectiveness of your workouts!\n\nIf you read this description all the way through, let me know below in the comments how often you stretch, and what your stretching goal is for the coming week! \n\nThank-you for joining me today :) \n\nMake sure to follow my IG for my daily updates on what's happening in the growwithjo community, and how you can improve your life physically, mentally and spiritually https://www.instagram.com/growwithjo/?hl=en\n________________________________________________________________\n\nRESULTS\n\nSHARE YOUR WORKOUT VIDEOS on Tik Tok, YouTube or Instagram for a chance to be featured in my next video or on our community Youtube: @growwithjo unified\n\nRecord a video or take a picture of you doing the workout, tag me @growwithjo #growwithjo @growwithjo_unified\n\nTo get the BEST (AND QUICKER) RESULTS, follow a nutrition plan that supports your goals.

    "I faithfully do your workouts EVERYDAY and the changes I have seen in my body is literally everything!!!! So many different workouts and intensity levels I love it!!! I appreciate you for sharing and constantly posting new workouts!!\u2764\ufe0f",
    "I saved this video about a month ago when I had a bit of pain but didn\u2019t attempt it. I started the gym today and decided to do this stretch. I was slightly worried it wasn\u2019t beginner or fat person friendly but decided to do it and skip anyone that felt too difficult. <br><br>15mins later and I\u2019m happy to say I did it and only skipped two as I wasn\u2019t flexible enough for them. <br><br>If you\u2019re like me and worried it might be too much for you, just give it a go, do as much as you can and remember to smile and pace yourself. You\u2019ve got this!",
    "Today was my first day doing your videos. Can I just say <b>especially</b> as a woman it was so refreshing to watch someone REAL workout. I loved seeing that you had to adjust your clothes occasionally, got off rhythm once and weren&#39;t doing every single rep perfectly. Other fitness videos always say you don&#39;t have to be perfect and then the instructor has a rock hard jiggle free body and never misses a beat. Thank you and I hope I can keep up with your weekly routines \ud83d\ude0a",
    "36 yrs old, I do this daily along with your mobility stretches, for anti-aging, 25 min total daily, and now I&#39;m hooked on stretching and I&#39;m lucky to have met you on YouTube.  Life-changing.  We all use it (our bodies) or lose it (our health).  Thank you for being an inspiration. \ud83d\udc9c"
