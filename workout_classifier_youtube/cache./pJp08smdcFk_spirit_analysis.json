  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout has a clear focus on 'Structured & Disciplined' due to its methodical approach of performing 9 specific exercises in a precise interval format (30 seconds on, 5 seconds transition), as described in the metadata. The channel's emphasis on physical therapy and proper technique strongly supports this classification. The presence of a physical therapist guiding the exercises further aligns with a structured spirit. This spirit scored at 0.85 due to the explicit mention of protocol-driven sessions focusing on core strength improvement. 'Soothing & Restorative' also features due to the workout's emphasis on alleviating pain and enhancing overall well-being. The description mentions decreasing pain and improving resilience, suggesting a restorative component. This spirit scored 0.65, as the restorative element is implicit but aligns with the goal of reducing back pain and promoting muscular health. Other spirits were less relevant, given the indoor, form-focused nature with no high-energy or outdoor components evident."
