  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is strongly identified as 'Pilates' due to multiple references in the title, description, and tags such as '30 MIN PILATES WORKOUT' and 'intermediate pilates'. The channel, 'Move with Nicole', heavily focuses on Pilates and Yoga, reinforcing this classification. The score of 0.9 is given for its very high presence. 'Mat' is selected next due to phrases like 'Mat Pilates', highlighting the workout is conducted on a mat, given a score of 0.7 for its strong presence. Lastly, 'Weight workout' is included with a score of 0.6 since the description suggests optional small weights, making them a significant but not essential element of the workout. This is confirmed by comments appreciating weights. Other categories like 'Body weight' or 'Yoga' are less relevant here due to the specific focus on Pilates and weights."
