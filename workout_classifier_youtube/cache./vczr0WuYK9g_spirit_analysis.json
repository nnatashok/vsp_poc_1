  "spiritsExplanation": "The video 'Calisthenics for Beginners | In Depth Step-by-Step Guide to Building Strength and Muscle' primarily embodies the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (score: 0.9). This conclusion is supported by the detailed step-by-step approach indicated in the title, the chronological breakdown of exercise types (pushing, pulling, core, leg movements), and the focus on progression and templates. These elements indicate a methodical, progressive training style suitable for building foundational strength and muscle. The presence of structured time stamps further highlights the disciplined approach.\n\nAdditionally, there are elements of 'Flow & Rhythm' (score: 0.5) due to the emphasis on coordination and smooth movement transitions inherent in calisthenics. The video includes stretching and warm-up, which suggest a rhythm in the workout preparation. However, the video's primary focus on structure limits the strength of this secondary classification.\n\nOther spirits were excluded as there's no indication of high intensity, restorative elements, specific sports skills, or outdoor environmental engagement in the metadata."
