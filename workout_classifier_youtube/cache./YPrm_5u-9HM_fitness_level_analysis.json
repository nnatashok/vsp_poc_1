  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated as Beginner to Intermediate. The workout is an indoor cycling session, which generally involves simple pedaling movements without complex coordination demands. However, since the session involves different pedaling speeds and instructions, including a pyramid structure, it requires some level of concentration and control, thus making it suitable for Intermediate as well. The guidance provided by Dan Lloyd, as mentioned in the description, helps enhance the technique understanding, making it approachable for beginners with guidance.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.75,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated between Moderate and Challenging. The 15-minute duration suggests a moderate effort level, but the mention of a 'short but tough, effective training session' and the 'pyramid structure with different pedalling speeds' implies a higher intensity workout, which aligns with a Challenging effort level. User comments indicating increased heart rates and leg burning suggest significant cardiovascular effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.7,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is assessed as Beginner to Intermediate. The workout's relatively short duration (16:29) and the indoor cycling nature make it accessible for beginners, especially under guided instruction. However, given that it is an effective cardio session using pyramid structure, it may pose challenges for complete beginners but is well suited for those with some basic fitness levels. User comments suggest accessibility for older individuals and those with certain health conditions, reinforcing the suitability for these fitness levels."
