  "vibesExplanation": "The selected workout vibes were chosen based on the following evidence: \n\n1. **The Zen Flow (Score: 0.9):** This vibe is characterized by grounding, intentional, and breath-centered movements. The workout is described as a 'flexibility, mobility and relaxation' routine that can be done daily. The use of words like 'relaxation' and 'calming music' (as mentioned in comments) supports this, aligning well with a Zen Flow experience. \n\n2. **The Reboot Workout (Score: 0.8):** This vibe focuses on a total-body refresh through deep stretching with low stress. The workout's focus on flexibility and relaxation, especially being recommended for post-workout recovery, fits the Reboot Workout. It's intended to relieve muscle tension and improve well-being, as noted in the channel description and comments. \n\n3. **The Deep Recharge (Score: 0.7):** This vibe captures the essence of nervous system reset, highlighted by comments about feeling fresh and relieved from stress, suggesting an ultra-gentle movement experience. The video is also used at the end of the day, aligning it with this vibe.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Comfort Moves' were considered due to the routine's accessibility, but the focus on flexibility and mobility suggested a more dynamic experience than comfort-based workouts."
