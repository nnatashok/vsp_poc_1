  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"Rolling With The Hills | 45 Mins HIIT Indoor Cycling Workout\" strongly indicates the necessity of an exercise bike. The title itself specifies 'Indoor Cycling Workout', and tags such as 'spin class', 'spinning', 'indoor cycling', 'bike workout', and 'gym cycle' imply that an exercise bike or spin bike is essential for performing the workout. Additionally, comments from viewers mention using their spin bikes and indoor trainers to follow along with the session, reinforcing the high likelihood that an exercise bike is required. Therefore, the confidence level for requiring an exercise bike is very high at 0.9, as the entire workout revolves around cycling indoors."
