  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Pilates' with a score of 1.0, supported by several key indicators in the metadata: the video title explicitly states 'Pilates for Beginners' and 'Mat Pilates,' and the tags repeatedly mention 'pilates workout,' 'pilates for beginners,' and variations thereof, all confirming Pilates as the core focus. The channel 'Move With Nicole' also aligns with this category, as Nicole is a certified Pilates instructor, further substantiated by the channel's history of hosting Pilates-related content. The description and the channel's background reinforce this focus, mentioning Nicole's expertise in Pilates.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Mat,' with a score of 0.7, as the title and description highlight 'At-Home Mat Pilates' and the use of an exercise mat ('Mat from Liforme' in the description). This implies mat-based exercises are a significant component of the workout. \n\nNo other categories were selected as the focus is explicitly set on Pilates and mat-based exercises without equipment, with comments highlighting the relaxation and beginner-friendly nature of the workout rather than intense strength training or other forms of exercises."
