  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a guided meditation, which involves following verbal instructions for mindfulness and relaxation. There are no complex physical movements or coordination required, making it accessible to those new to meditation. The title and description emphasize inner peace and self-love, not technical yoga postures or exercises. The use of technique-related tags such as 'mindful movement' and 'guided meditation' indicate beginner-level technique difficulty due to the simplicity and passivity involved.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is extremely low, as meditation typically requires minimal physical exertion. The goal is relaxation and mental focus, with participants primarily seated or lying down, engaging mainly in controlled breathing. The session is designed for stress reduction and inner peace, without mentions of physical challenges, intensity, or exhaustion. This aligns closely with the 'Light' category, suitable for complete beginners or users seeking gentle activities.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the meditation focus and absence of physical exertion, this video predominantly suits 'Beginner' level participants who are new to mindfulness practices. However, meditation can also attract those at 'Intermediate' and 'Advanced' levels who seek mental clarity and emotional growth, as suggested by the wide appeal and deep emotional responses in top comments. Thus, while primarily beginner-friendly, the required fitness level generously includes all three levels due to diverse mental benefits and audience appeal, supported by emotional content in the comments."
