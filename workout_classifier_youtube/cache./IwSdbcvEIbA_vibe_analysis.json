  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is identified primarily as 'The Masterclass Workout' (score: 0.7) due to its focus on technique and skill-building as evidenced by user comments highlighting 'great technique' and 'exercise selection'. The length and comprehensive nature of a '50 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT' suggest a detailed instructional focus typical of a masterclass.\n\nThe 'Zen Flow' vibe (score: 0.6) is inferred from the calming nature of Pilates, the 'energised and more centred' feeling described in the video description, and the mention of relaxing elements like 'light background music'. These factors align with the grounding and breath-centered qualities of Zen Flow.\n\nFinally, 'The Progression Quest' (score: 0.5) is indicated by the potential for long-term improvement due to consistent practice, as highlighted by a commenter who has been doing these workouts regularly for 16 months. This vibe captures the incremental improvement aspect found in this routine.\n\nThe high overall confidence (0.8) in these vibes comes from clear indications in the comments and the structured approach to Pilates instruction."
