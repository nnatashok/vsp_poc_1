  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as \"Structured & Disciplined\" with a high confidence level (0.9) because the title and description emphasize a strength training regimen catered to beginners and seniors. Phrases like \"each exercise is explained to ensure you do the exercises properly with good form\" and \"use a heavier weight to always see improvements\" indicate a focus on methodical, progressive training. The tags also support this with terms such as \"strength training workout for seniors\" and \"beginner strength training.\" \n\n\"Soothing & Restorative\" is included with a moderate score (0.6) due to the gentle approach tailored for seniors and beginners, including chair exercises, which are often used for rehabilitation and gentle fitness. User comments praising the availability of both seated and standing options and the welcoming nature of the instructor further underscore this spirit. The channel's focus on low-impact, safe workouts also supports this categorization. Other spirits, such as \"High-Energy & Intense,\" are excluded due to the workout's gentle nature and audience."
