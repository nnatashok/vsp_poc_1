  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Stretching,' evident from the video title '20 min TOTAL BODY STRETCH ROUTINE' and reinforced throughout the description and tags like 'stretch routine,' 'flexibility,' and 'muscle recovery.' The routine's focus on muscle recovery, flexibility, and relaxation further confirms stretching as the central theme. This warrants a high score of 0.9 for 'Stretching.'\n\nThe secondary category is 'Yoga,' as suggested by the inclusion of yoga tags such as 'yoga,' 'yoga stretch,' and the mention of 'familiar YOGA postures within the routine' in the description. While the main workout is not explicitly a yoga class, the presence of yoga elements justifies a moderate score of 0.7 for 'Yoga.' Other categories like 'Mat' were considered due to the mention of 'grab your mat,' but were deemed less relevant compared to stretching and yoga activities detailed in the metadata. The confidence level is very high (0.9) due to clear and consistent references to stretching activities across various metadata elements."
