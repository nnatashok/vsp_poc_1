  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is labeled as a \"no equipment workout\" in the tags, strongly indicating that the workout is designed to be performed without any additional equipment. The tags 'no equipment workout', 'home workout with no equipment', and 'beginner friendly' further support this. The description reinforces that the workout is simple and doesn't involve jumping or difficult exercises, suggesting that it doesn't require any equipment. The listed exercises, such as 'Squat side reach', 'Over head twists', and 'Bird Dog', are typical bodyweight exercises that do not usually require equipment. The emphasis on the workout being beginner-friendly and accessible to perform at home, even in pyjamas, aligns with a bodyweight-only routine. There is no mention of optional equipment in the comments or description, confirming high confidence that no equipment is needed."
