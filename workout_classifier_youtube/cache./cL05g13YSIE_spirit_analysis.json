  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, with a score of 0.95 due to several explicit indicators in the metadata. The title itself includes 'EPIC HIGH INTENSITY' and 'HIIT', which are direct descriptors of high-energy, intense, fast-paced workouts. The description emphasizes raising heart rates, sweating, and challenging the body, again pointing to a very high-energy nature. Frequent use of burst-style exercises such as burpees, squat jumps, and mountain climbers further supports this classification.\n\nAdditionally, the workout fits the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.65. The description details a precise structure including timed intervals (30 seconds work, 15 seconds rest), repeated sequences (staple burpees), and clear instructions for switching sides during exercises. This shows a methodical approach to the workout session.\n\nThe lack of elements like music-driven movement or a focus on flow precludes categorizing it under 'Flow & Rhythm', while the intensity excludes 'Soothing & Restorative'."
