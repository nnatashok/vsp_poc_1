  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 'super sweaty' and designed to be done in a 'consistent' manner throughout, implying a steady pace with moderate cardiovascular demand. The comments suggest a moderate difficulty level, with a user achieving a good workout without feeling exhausted, and another appreciating the lack of noise, indicating a less intense style. However, the workout's ability to still generate a sweat suggests some might find it 'challenging' especially due to constant movement, thus a small challenging score is included.",
