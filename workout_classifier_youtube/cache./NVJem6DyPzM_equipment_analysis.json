  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is explicitly described as a '5 Minute Spin Class' and an 'Intense Tabata Cycling Workout,' which clearly indicates the need for an exercise bike. The tags such as 'spin class,' 'indoor cycling workout,' 'stationary bike workout,' and 'tabata cycling' further support this requirement. Additionally, the description emphasizes that the session is a 'spin class' and refers to cycling. Thus, there is very high confidence (1.0) that an exercise bike is essential for this workout."
