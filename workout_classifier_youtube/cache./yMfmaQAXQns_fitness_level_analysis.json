  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty of the Spin\u00ae class is primarily Beginner to Intermediate. Spinning isn't technically complex, as it involves basic cycling movements. However, the use of varied cycling techniques such as hills, sprints, and jumps does introduce a level of complexity that might require a bit of coordination and understanding of bike resistance settings. This aligns more with an Intermediate level, but beginners can still participate by modifying the intensity and resistance settings to their capability.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the moderate technique difficulty and the challenging effort level, the workout aligns well with Intermediate fitness levels. Advanced fitness level is also appropriate due to the high-intensity nature of the workout, which would be quite demanding for most users, especially when trying to maintain pace and resistance settings on a spin bike. The workout duration of over 30 minutes also suggests a level above complete beginner."
