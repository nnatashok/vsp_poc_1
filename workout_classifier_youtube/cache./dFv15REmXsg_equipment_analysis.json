  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title \"45' RIDE - Who Runs The World\" and the tag 'spin' strongly suggest that an exercise bike is required for this workout. The term 'ride' in workout contexts typically refers to cycling, further supported by tags like 'spin class.' Moreover, user comments refer to riding and the motivation from the video, implying an exercise bike is central to the workout. Given these references, the requirement of an exercise bike has very high confidence (0.8-1.0). No other equipment is indicated in the metadata."
