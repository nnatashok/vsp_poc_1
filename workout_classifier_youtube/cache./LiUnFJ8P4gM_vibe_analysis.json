  "vibesExplanation": "The video focuses on \"4-7-8 Calm Breathing Exercise,\" which is a method known for calming the sympathetic nervous system and promoting relaxation, as explained in the description. This aligns strongly with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe, with the video offering deep relaxation and potentially helping with sleep, thus earning a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe mention of mindful breathing, anxiety relief, and progressive techniques further supports a secondary association with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The methodical and breath-centered nature, typical of meditative practices, indicates a calm and grounding workout vibe, hence receiving a score of 0.75.\n\nTags and comments like \"anxiety relief,\" \"to relax or fall asleep,\" and user feedback describing calm post-use reinforce these vibes. Other vibes like 'The Reboot Workout' might seem relevant, but the primary focus of nervous system reset and deep relaxation was more fitting of 'The Deep Recharge.' Overall, the evidence strongly supports the assigned vibes with high confidence."
