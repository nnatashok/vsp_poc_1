    "it is profound to be told to accept negative emotions instead of dispelling them. I think this is a rare place where we are asked to accept them. makes me feel so relieved and stress free to not have to hide them or make excuses for them",
    "Thank you Dear Guruji:  One week of doing morning and evening the meditation with you on YouTube has completely reduced all my anxiousness and worries.  I recommend this mediation to every one who feels like me.  Before you think of doing anything in your life.  Please do this mediation and see how much joy you feel.  I listen to Guruji talk in English, HInid and in Tamil.  All day for about one week has changed my life.  Thank you so much for coming in my life through YouTube.  Gita Srinivasan",
