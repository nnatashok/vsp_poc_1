  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary focus of the video is a beginner calisthenics workout, as clearly indicated by the title 'TRUE Beginner Calisthenics Workout No Equipment.' The tags further reinforce this, repeatedly using phrases such as 'calisthenics,' 'bodyweight training,' and 'calisthenics beginner workout.' These align with the definition of calisthenics, which involves gymnastic exercises for strength and flexibility using bodyweight movements, which is the essence of this workout's content. A score of 0.9 is assigned to the 'Calisthenics' category due to the overwhelming emphasis on calisthenics in both the title and tags.\n\nThe 'Body weight' category is also relevant, supported by tags like 'bodyweight training' and 'body weight at home workout.' This indicates the workout involves exercises using only body weight as resistance, though this is less emphasized compared to calisthenics. Therefore, a score of 0.7 is assigned. The title and description emphasize no equipment usage aligning with bodyweight exercises, but the specific focus on calisthenics justifies its leading position in classification."
