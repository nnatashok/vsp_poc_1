  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily categorized as a \"Walking\" workout with high confidence (0.8). Evidence for this includes tags such as \"walking workouts\" and descriptions highlighting low-impact, all-standing exercises, and walking in place. This strongly suggests a focus on walking-based movements without equipment. \n\nA secondary categorization is \"Mat\" with notable confidence (0.6). Although there is no explicit mention of using a mat, the reference to an 'all standing workout' that can be performed in a small space implies exercises that involve body movement on the spot, which aligns with general floor exercises performed on an exercise mat. The low-impact, bodyweight nature of the workout also suggests a similarity to Mat-type workouts that use minimal to no equipment. \n\nOther categories like \"HIIT\" or \"Body weight\" are excluded due to a lack of high-intensity claims and minimal emphasis on strength through bodyweight resistance. The absence of any equipment-specific terms also rules out categories like \"Elliptical\" or \"Indoor biking.\""
