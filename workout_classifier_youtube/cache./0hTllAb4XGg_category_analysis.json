  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is \"Yoga,\" confidently scored at 0.9, due to explicit references in the title \"Runner's Yoga - Yoga With Adriene,\" description, and tags like \"yoga for runners,\" \"yoga with adriene,\" and \"post workout yoga.\" The video is from a channel focused entirely on yoga, enhancing confidence in this classification. The practice is described as a \"30 min practice using the principles of yoga to cultivate balance,\" affirming it as a yoga session.\n\nThe secondary category is \"Stretching,\" scored at 0.6, indicated by phrases like \"use the breath to stretch and soothe the muscles of the body\" and \"yoga stretching\" tag. Although it is primarily a yoga practice, stretching is a significant aspect as it aims to soothe muscles post-cardio, an essential component of yoga poses.\n\nOther categories like \"Running\" or \"Walking\" are not applicable despite the mentions because the physical activity is yoga-derived and not running or walking itself. \"Yoga With Adriene\" consistently provides yoga-focused content, ruling out non-yoga categories."
