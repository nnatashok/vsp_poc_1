  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Indoor biking' with a high score of 0.9 based on explicit mentions in the title ('SPIN CLASS: TABATA HIIT | INDOOR CYCLING WORKOUT'), tags (e.g., 'indoor cycling workout', 'spin class', 'stationary bike workout'), and description ('This 10 minute spin class is a high intensity Tabata HIIT'). The presence of 'Tabata HIIT' indicates a strong secondary classification under 'HIIT', with a score of 0.8. The workout includes high-intensity intervals, a characteristic of HIIT. The presence of a warm-up and cool-down structure in the description further supports the combination of cycling and interval training. Other categories are not relevant due to the clear focus on cycling and interval-based training."
