Terms like 'zen' in the tags also support this vibe.\n\n\"The Reboot Workout\" receives a score of 0.6, reflecting a moderate match. The video offers a short, calming session that can refresh the mind but doesn't emphasize physical stretching or movement typical of a full-body refresh, which is why it is not the primary classification.\n\nThe high confidence (0.9) in the analysis comes from consistent metadata and comments reflecting a calming and restorative experience from both a mental and emotional perspective."
