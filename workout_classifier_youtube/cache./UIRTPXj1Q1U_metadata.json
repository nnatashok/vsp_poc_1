  "title": "10 Minute Lower Body Stretch Routine (For Tight Hamstrings & Hip Flexors)",
  "description": "Since being under lockdown for COVID, many of us have transitioned to working and learning from home. With that, we tend to sit a lot more than usual and that is a recipe for tight muscles, joint tension, and lower back pain. So in this video, we guide you through a quick, 10 minute lower body stretch routine that specifically targets the muscle groups that tighten from sitting: the hamstrings and hip flexors. This routine is made up of 5 active stretches that will allow you to relieve pain/tension, and gain flexibility over time. Grab a yoga mat, try out the stretch, and drop a comment to let us know if this helped you in any way!\n\n(BTW: We apologize for the bad audio at times. We had some technical issues while filming but hopefully it doesn't ruin your experience with us.)\n\n\nHELP US GROW THIS CHANNEL TO 100,000 SUBS!\n\nFollow Us On Instagram For More Fitness Related Content:\n\nJuice: @JuicetonTx\nToya: @ToyaCherrelle\nPersonal Training Business Page: @OneBodyLA",
