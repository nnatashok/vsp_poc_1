  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Elliptical' with a score of 1.0. This is strongly supported by the video title '30 Minute Heart Pumping Elliptical HIIT Workout' and repeated mentions of 'elliptical' and 'cross trainer' in the tags and description. The workout is designed around the use of an elliptical machine, as explicitly stated in the title and description.\n\nThe secondary category is 'HIIT' with a score of 0.7. The workout incorporates High-Intensity Interval Training principles, indicated by the title and the detailed description of interval sets with varying resistance levels ('Interval 1: Jog \u2013 1 minute...Interval 1: Sprint \u2013 30 seconds'). The repeated use of 'HIIT' in the title and tags supports this classification.\n\nOverall, the metadata provides clear and strong evidence for these categories, thus the confidence level is set at 1.0, indicating very high confidence in these classifications."
