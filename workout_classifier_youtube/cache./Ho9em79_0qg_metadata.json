    "Dear Adrienne,  My daughter did your videos every day for many years. We often did some together. She died suddenly from an undetected heart condition last year before her 26th birthday.  This year on her birthday I did Yoga for Vulnerability, and felt her close to me.  Thank you for the beautiful effect you had in her life.  I miss her every day.   Until I see her again.   Bless you in your gift to this hurting world.",
    "My chiropractor sent me this video to help with my chronic lower back pain. Just wanted to let you know; five years later, and you&#39;re still helping people. \ud83d\udc95",
    "This video taught me that in my old age, I have to take better care of my old body.<br><br>Then I remember I\u2019m 26 and I shouldn\u2019t be this tense. Thank you for your work, I didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what a loose lower back feels like.",
    "Was a heroin and meth user for a decade. Clean for 8 years now. The only thing my mum asks me when she calls now isn&#39;t &quot;are you safe?&quot; it&#39;s &quot;did you do yoga with Adriene today love?&quot; Thank you for the help and inspiration during a really difficult time."
