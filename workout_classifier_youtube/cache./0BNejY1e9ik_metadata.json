  "title": "Wim Hof Method Guided Breathing for Beginners (3 Rounds Slow Pace)",
  "description": "!! Don't do the breathing exercises in a swimming pool, before going underwater, beneath the shower, or piloting any vehicle. Always practice sitting or lying down in a safe environment. Tinnitus symptoms may appear as a result of pushing too forcefully during the breathing exercise. If this happens, take a step back in your future practice, it\u2019s important to increase gradually, not forcefully !!\n\nThis is a slower paced Wim Hof Method breathing exercise that starts with a 30 seconds hold building up to 90 seconds breath hold. Very suitable for beginners or anyone who prefers a more gentle guidance. \n\nSafety: Read about Shallow Water Blackout:\nhttps://www.wimhofmethod.com/what-is-shallow-water-blackout\n\nThis Breathing Bubble is an audiovisual guide that helps you maintain rhythm and pace during your breathing sessions. Simply watch the bubble as it expands and contracts, and follow with your breath. You'll hear Wim breathe alongside you, and entrancing background sounds help tune out your surroundings, allowing you to focus on nothing but your breath.\n\nIf you prefer Wim Hof to explain this in person:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzCaZQqAs9I\n\nIf you want a faster paced guided breathing exercise:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ\n\nCheck out our INTERACTIVE guided breathing in our FREE mobile app:\nhttps://www.wimhofmethod.com/wim-hof-method-mobile-app\n\nGo deeper into the Wim Hof Method practice with our online video courses:\nhttps://www.wimhofmethod.com/elearning\n\nWanna help us TRANSLATE this video in your local language?

    "started doing the breathing exercises for a month and I don\u2019t get anxiety attacks like often before. I suffered from depression because I am a double leg amputee. I thought the world was done for <a href=\"http://me.now/\">me.now</a> I feel calm , ready and positive. I told myself this is not my destiny. I\u2019m getting my prosthetic legs next week and ready to explore this world. I love it. Wim Hof 4 life!!!",
