  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is \"Stretching\" with high confidence (score: 0.8). The video title explicitly mentions \"FULL BODY STRETCH ROUTINE,\" indicating a focus on exercises to improve flexibility and mobility. Further evidence from the description highlights goals such as increasing recovery quality and preventing injuries, common objectives of stretching routines. Tags like \"stretch,\" \"stretching exercises,\" and \"mobility routine\" reinforce this classification.\n\nA secondary category of \"Yoga\" is included with a lower score (0.2) due to the presence of the tag \"yoga,\" although the description and title emphasize traditional stretching rather than yoga's more holistic approach. Thus, yoga is likely a minor element, suggested possibly in relation to the use of yoga mats or as an overlap in general stretching benefits.\n\nOverall, the video aligns closely with stretching practices and mobility enhancement as a central theme, with minimal elements potentially linked to yoga."
