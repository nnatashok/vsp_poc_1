  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is clearly identified as a HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) workout, which is strongly supported by the title \"20 MIN CALORIE KILLER HIIT WORKOUT - Full body Cardio, No Equipment, No Repeat\" and reiterated throughout the description and tags, such as \"hiit workout\", \"fat burning hiit workout\", and \"high intensity cardio workout.\" The description outlines a 20-minute routine with intervals of 45 seconds of work followed by 15 seconds of rest, typical of HIIT structure, leading to a score of 1.0 for the HIIT category.\n\nAdditionally, the workout is performed without equipment as indicated in the description and tags (\"No Equipment\" and \"no equipment hiit\"), suggesting reliance on body weight exercises, such as calisthenics or general bodyweight intervals, justifying a score of 0.6 for the Body weight category. The absence of equipment solidifies the choice of these categories, dismissing other potential classifications like Weight workout or Indoor biking."
