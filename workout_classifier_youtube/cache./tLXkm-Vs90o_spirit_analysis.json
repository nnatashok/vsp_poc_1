  "spiritsExplanation": "The video titled 'Morning Breathwork Practice' suggests a focus on calming and soothing techniques right from the onset. The description emphasizes a 'gentle morning breath practice' aimed at starting the day with a 'clear, calm, and energized mind,' highlighting recovery and relaxation aspects typical of the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This is further reinforced by comments stating how the practice contributes to a calm and present energy, which aligns with restorative qualities. Therefore, the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is assigned a high score of 0.95 due to these strong explicit indicators.\n\nAdditionally, the practice is a 'routine,' which often implies a degree of rhythmic involvement, as participants repeatedly perform coordinated breathing. However, there is less explicit evidence for 'Flow & Rhythm' as the primary characteristic, since the video focuses more on the calming effects rather than coordination with music. Thus, it receives a moderate score of 0.5. High-energy, structured protocols, sports-specificity, or outdoor elements are not suggested by the metadata."
