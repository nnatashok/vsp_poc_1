  "description": "Burn lots of calories & tone your muscles with a BASIC HIIT workout. This might get you to your limits but\u2026 the music is amazing! \u2665\ufe0e / Werbung\n\nWoooop woooop, I already know our previous 10min HIIT by heart (including the songs). So I was desperate for a new version :D \n\nThis workout is:\n1. HIGHLY EFFECTIVE \nSuper intense full body movements, training almost every muscle in your body. Paired with a high heart rate non stop = burning calories, burning fat, increase your metabolism, tone your muscles\n2. FILLED WITH BASICS\nNothing too fancy, nothing too dancy. Ask your male partner to join! They won't need to shake their hips for this one.\n2. a mix out of \u201eHARD MOVEMENTS\" and \"ACTIVE BREAKS\".  \nYou will find Planks in between all the High Knees and Jumps. Almost feels like a break, but don't forget to keep the core strength!\n3. HIGH ENERGY. \nFor some reason it doesn't drag me down - but rather gives me MORE energy! \n\nAs usual: NO LUNGES. \n\n__\n\nIf you struggle or need a break: don't worry about it. Take a small rest, get something to drink & continue once you're ready :) most important is that you don't quit and push yourself. \n\n\u25b8 Depending on your fitness level, height and weight you will burn between 70-130 kcal. \n\n__\n\n\u25b8 you can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min, Beginner Friendly combinations & a DANCE plan.
