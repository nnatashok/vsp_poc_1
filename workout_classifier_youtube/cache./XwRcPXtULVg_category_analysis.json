  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Weight workout', with a score of 0.9. This is because the title and description both explicitly mention the use of dumbbells, and the detailed exercise list includes numerous exercises typically performed with weights, like bicep curls, chest flyes, and Romanian deadlifts. The repeated emphasis on dumbbells and full-body strength training justifies a high score and confidence in this category. \n\nThe secondary category, 'Body weight', is included with a score of 0.5. While the focus is on using dumbbells, some exercises like glute bridges and push-ups can be performed using body weight as well, suggesting a moderate presence of this category.\n\nThe video's high engagement and structured format strongly point to these categories. Other potential categories, such as 'HIIT', were considered due to the interval training structure but were excluded due to the focus on strength rather than high-intensity cardio."
