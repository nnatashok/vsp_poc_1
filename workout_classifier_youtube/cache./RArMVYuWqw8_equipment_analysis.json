  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"Physio Guided Lower Back Stretches for Beginners (15 Minute Routine)\" suggests that the exercises involve lying down on a firm surface, making a mat necessary for comfort and support. The video description specifically states that stretches are performed while lying down, which indicates the use of a mat. Additionally, exercises such as child's pose and bridging exercises typically involve some form of floor contact, further implying the need for a mat. Given these details and the context of a home workout aimed at stretching and flexibility, I assign a very high confidence score of 0.8 to the inclusion of a mat, as it is likely essential to execute this routine comfortably and safely."
