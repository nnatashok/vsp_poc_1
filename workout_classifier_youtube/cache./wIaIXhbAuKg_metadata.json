    "As I lay on the ground after this workout, sweating like a pig, I realize the 6 weeks are over. I&#39;ve lost 24 lbs, gotten much more defined and I&#39;m loving where my fitness journey is going. I can&#39;t recommend this 6 Week Shred enough. It has changed not only my body but also how I think about food, run my business, and even how I interact with my kids. I have so much more energy, confidence, and pride! I can not thank you enough for what these short/long 6 weeks have done for me.",
