  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The required equipment for this workout is an Elliptical, which has a very high confidence level of 1.0. The title explicitly mentions an 'Elliptical Workout,' and the description frequently discusses using an elliptical machine for this high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session. Key phrases such as 'HIIT workout using an elliptical,' and 'elliptical workout will push your to your MAXIMUM,' confirm that an elliptical is central and necessary for this workout. The tags and description both emphasize the workout being performed on an elliptical, making it unlikely that any other equipment is needed. Therefore, an elliptical is the sole piece of equipment required for this workout."
