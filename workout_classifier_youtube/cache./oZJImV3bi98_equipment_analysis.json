  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video focuses on 'Weighted Calisthenics,' as indicated in both the title and description. This strongly implies the use of a weight vest, which is explicitly mentioned in the description: 'Take your training to the next level with a Heria weight vest.' This suggests that the workout prominently involves weighted exercises, possibly including the use of ankle/wrist weights as an option within this context, meriting a high confidence score of 0.8 for including weighted equipment. The mention of weights in the comments further supports this, as viewers specifically note the handling of weights during the workouts, confirming their integral role. Although ankle/wrist weights are not directly cited, the concept of weighted exercises aligns with their use, justifying their inclusion. The 'Other' category is used to denote the weight vest as a specific equipment piece mentioned."
