    "I am in love with how I feel after a workout with you-NOT during \ud83e\udd23but after I feel freaking amazing!",
    "I&#39;m just so happy to start coming across channels that are doing strength training. Honestly, it is so important for women!",
    "Epic. I started following your rides in February, but didn&#39;t subscribe to the calendar until March.. I have type 1 diabetes, addison&#39;s disease (I don&#39;t make adrenaline), and have Hashimoto&#39;s..my weight has been hard to control, but GIRL... with your calendars, workouts, and motivation and modifications, I&#39;ve lost 20 lbs and feel better than I have in years. Thank you for doing this. I couldn&#39;t have done it without you rallying me on. \ud83d\udc95",
    "I love that you\u2019re not overly peppy while I\u2019m struggling with my weights. I feel like I\u2019m training with a good friend.",
    "I felt like I needed a full body workout tonight as we have been iced in for all week and I&#39;m starting to lose my mind! I don&#39;t remember doing this one and I hadn&#39;t liked it, so I must have missed it. I love this type of format! Here&#39;s to being stronger to weather the &quot;storms&quot; that come our way. As always thank you for being part of my journey."
