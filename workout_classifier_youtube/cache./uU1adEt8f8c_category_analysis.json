  "categoriesConfidence": 0.9,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as 'Breathing exercises' with a high score of 0.9 due to explicit references in the title and description to 'guided breathwork' and integration of specific breathwork methods such as the 'Wim Hof Method breathing' and 'physiological sigh'. This indicates a strong focus on controlled breathing techniques. The video also mentions that it serves as a guided session, suggesting structured breathing exercises. \n\n'Meditation' is assigned a score of 0.8, supported by the video including 'mindfulness meditation', as evidenced in both the description and timestamps ('Body Sensing / Mindfulness Meditation'). Comments also emphasize the mindfulness and meditation components, noting its calming effects and impact on focus. The combination of mindfulness and breathwork suggests a meditative focus. \n\nOther categories were not selected due to lack of evidence supporting physical exercises or movements, suggesting minimal relevance to those types of workouts."
