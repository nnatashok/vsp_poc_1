  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is best classified under 'Flow & Rhythm' with high confidence, indicated by terms such as 'Flow', 'Synchronize the breath with movement', and 'moving meditation' found in the title and description. These elements suggest a flowing, continuous sequence that is smooth and rhythm-based. The use of breath synchronization also aligns with mind-body connection, a key trait of the Flow & Rhythm spirit. This is further supported by user comments that highlight the relaxing, meditative experience of the session. The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also applicable, evidenced by phrases like 'giving every area of the body some love', 'fun and supportive', and 'feeling of vitality and balance'. It suggests a gentle approach to building strength and mobility without high intensity, targeted at recovery and wellbeing. However, elements like 'cultivating heat' might suggest a mild intensity, hence a moderate score for Soothing & Restorative. The lack of rigorous discipline or specific athletic training excludes spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Sport & Agility'."
