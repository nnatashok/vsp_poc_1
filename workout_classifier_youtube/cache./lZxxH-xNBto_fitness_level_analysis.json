  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is classified as Beginner to Intermediate because it is a 'Vinyasa Yoga Flow', indicating a series of linked yoga poses, which can range from simple to moderately complex. The metadata suggests it is suitable for everyday practice, which implies accessibility to a wide range of users, including beginners. User comments appreciate the instructor's minimal cues and describe the session as peaceful and slow, suggesting the technique does not require advanced skills. Despite this, the presence of intermediate level Vinyasa yoga patterns suggests a bit more complexity than absolute beginner routines, thus an Intermediate score is also appropriate. There is low evidence for advanced techniques as the flow is described as calm and not overly challenging.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is assessed as Light to Moderate due to several indicators: the workout is a 20-minute session, typical for light exertion, especially in context with yoga which is not typically high-intensity. The comments and description point to a slow and peaceful session with minimal cues, suggesting it does not demand high energy expenditure and is intended to be calming rather than physically demanding. Some poses in a Vinyasa flow could elevate the effort to a moderate level for less conditioned users, especially when linking multiple poses in a sequence without extended rest.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is classified as Beginner to Intermediate, with a minor inclusion for Advanced. The sessions' described characteristics and user comments highlight an accessible and peaceful practice, deeming it highly suitable for beginners. The Vinyasa flow nature introduces a slightly elevated technique complexity for complete beginners, aligning with the Intermediate level. Advanced scores are minimal and relate to users desiring a calm yet somewhat engaging practice without extremely taxing elements. The video length fits comfortably in a category often accessible to Beginners interested in regular practice; however, the flow can be scaled up slightly by session familiarity or tempo adjustment to reach Intermediate users."
