  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe assigned is 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.8 because the workout is described as a low intensity, low impact steady state cardio workout, which aligns with the repetitive and zone-in nature typical of this vibe. The emphasis on 'steady state,' 'low impact,' and 'no rest' indicates a focus on maintaining a consistent effort without high peaks and valleys, further supporting this classification.\n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Groove Session' with a score of 0.6. Although the primary focus is on steady and methodical movement, the description emphasizes fun and maintaining a pace for the duration, with an array of varied exercises like 'Curstey Drop' and 'Rotational Jab,' that suggest an element of fluid and expressive movement, which aligns with the 'Groove Session' vibe.\n\nThe metadata lacks indicators of high intensity or competitiveness, allowing us to confidently exclude vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.' The focus on 'fun' and 'absolutely no pressure' diminishes the likelihood of vibes associated with high stress or intensity."
