  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a full body stretch routine focused on flexibility and relaxation, as indicated by the title \"15 min Full Body Stretch | Daily Routine for Flexibility & Relaxation\" and the tags like \"stretches for flexibility,\" \"relaxation,\" and \"stretching routine.\" The description promotes a relaxing 15-minute stretching routine, which typically involves floor exercises frequently performed on a mat for comfort and grip. The mention of \"yoga mats\" in the description under the product section and the style of exercises being \"relaxing\" reinforce the use of a mat. Therefore, a mat is identified with high confidence (0.75) as likely needed for this workout, due to its crucial role in providing comfort for stretching exercises."
