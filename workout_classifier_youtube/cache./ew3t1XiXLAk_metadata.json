This routine starts in the sitting position with deep breathing and shoulder mobility exercises. The guided routine progresses through a series of safe stretching and mobility exercises for improving posture and relieving strain on the neck and shoulders. The posture exercises include chest stretches and postural awareness. A combination of static and dynamic neck and shoulder stretches are repeated throughout the routine in sitting and then lying down. This home workout concludes lying down with deep breathing exercises and a short relaxation.\n\nI hope these exercises help you exercise at home, relax and stay well.\n- - - - - - - - - - \nMusic by Aiden Kenway: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEeJ... \nLights by Sappheiros https://soundcloud.com/sappheirosmusic Creative Commons \u2014 Attribution 3.0 Unported \u2014 CC BY 3.0 Free Download / Stream: https://bit.ly/LightsSappheiros Music promoted by Audio Library https://youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg\n- - - - - - - - - - \nDisclaimer \nThe information provided in this video is intended as general information and not a substitute for individual medical advice regarding your medical condition.

    "Nice relaxing voice, ignorable but chill background music, clear instructions with explanations for what we&#39;re working on - this was great!",
    "I tend to get terrible stiffness in my neck and shoulders, and this is by far the best stretching routine I have found. Thank you!",
    "I want to cry. Doing this was the first time I actually had my migraine go away in two weeks, thank you so much.",
    "I do the first 10 minutes of this routine 3x a day every day now while sitting at my desk. This has been helping me SO MUCH to loosen up my neck and shoulders, a problem area for me. Your voice is so soothing too. Thank you for putting together such a lovely video.",
    "As a short bartender, we\u2019re prone to shoulder and neck stiffness because of the repetitive motion that is often above our shoulders (from pouring draft beer or pouring liquor on a bar that\u2019s often high and out in front) this is a life changer.  Thank you!"
