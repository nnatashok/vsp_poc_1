These imply a grounding, intentional and introspective practice, common in slow-flow yoga sessions. The use of phrases such as 'lower your shoulders' and 'soothing' in user comments further supports this vibe, emphasizing breath-centered and unhurried elements.\n\nThe 'Groove Session' vibe is scored at 0.6 as there is a mention of 'music drops' and user comments highlighting a sense of enjoyment and expression, which are traits of being in the moment and finding a sense of enjoyment through movement.\n\nLastly, 'The Meditative Grind' is considered with a score of 0.5, reflecting the repetitive practice of daily yoga, as illustrated by comments about commitment and finding space for practice. The phrase 'craving the yoga' suggests a methodical, repetitive process that helps participants zone in and lock down into a personal rhythm.
