  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected for this workout video is 'Breathing exercises' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is strongly supported by the title ('5 Minute Motivating Breathwork'), and numerous tags such as 'breathing exercises', 'guided breathwork', 'breathing exercise', 'guided breathing exercises', and 'wim hof method', which indicate that the focus of the video is on breath control techniques. The description also highlights the benefits of regular breathwork practice, such as boosting the immune system and enhancing energy and focus, further solidifying this category selection. \n\nThe secondary category 'Meditation' is identified with a moderate score of 0.5. The tags include terms like 'manifestation meditation' and 'meditation', and the description mentions achieving states of relaxation, which are indicative of meditation practices. Moreover, a user comment refers to meditations following the breathwork, suggesting a complementary role in mindfulness activities, hence its inclusion with a moderate score.\n\nOther categories were considered but excluded due to lack of explicit evidence. The video lacks physical movements or equipment use, precluding it from categories like 'Mat', 'Yoga', 'Body weight', or 'Weight workout'. The precise focus on breathing, as echoed in both the comments and tags, justifies the chosen categorization."
