  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "Based on the title, description, and tags, the workout explicitly involves the use of a treadmill. The title '15-Min Beginner Interval Treadmill Follow Along' and tags such as 'hiit treadmill workout for weight loss', 'beginner treadmill workout', and 'follow along treadmill walk' strongly indicate that a treadmill is central to performing this workout. Additionally, the description mentions interval workouts involving 'run and recovery' on a treadmill, further confirming its necessity. Therefore, the confidence score for the treadmill is very high, at 1.0."
