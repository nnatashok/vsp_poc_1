  "vibesExplanation": "The video was classified primarily as 'The Firestarter' due to its intense and short duration. The clear focus on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is evident from both the title and description, highlighting terms like 'short sharp workout', '15 minutes', and 'tough workout', all of which align with the explosive and time-efficient nature of Firestarter vibes. The description further details intense intervals, such as '1 Min Max!' and '30s Max!', emphasizing rapid bursts of effort that are characteristic of this vibe. Additionally, the scoring of 0.85 indicates a strong alignment with Firestarter due to these explicit cues.\n\nThe secondary vibe, 'The Speed & Power Sprint', scored 0.7 because the workout involves several maximal effort intervals (e.g., '1 Min Max!'). These segments focus on maximizing power output in a cycling context, which closely aligns with the 'Speed & Power Sprint' vibe. However, it's secondary because the overall structure centers more on the interval nature than solely on peak power output.\n\nThe comments reinforce the perceived difficulty and effectiveness of the workout, supporting the high-intensity classification. Other vibes were excluded as there are no elements of meditation, flow, or recreational cycling, which would suggest other categories like 'The Groove Session' or 'The Meditative Grind.'"
