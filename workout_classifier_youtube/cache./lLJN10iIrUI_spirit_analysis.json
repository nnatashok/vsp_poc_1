  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.65 because it involves high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which is a hallmark of high-energy workouts designed to elevate heart rate and burn calories. This is evidenced by the mention of HIIT in the title, description, and tags, along with words like 'heart rate up' and 'burn calories'. Additionally, user comments reflect the energetic nature by appreciating the workout's ability to engage them quickly.\n\nHowever, the presence of modifiers such as 'beginners' and 'seniors', and the option to perform exercises seated, introduce a 'Soothing & Restorative' element with a score of 0.55. The workout's context of being accessible to those with limited mobility and the supportive community feel is restorative. This is reinforced by user comments expressing gratitude for the gentle, achievable format.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to lack of explicit relevance to structured technical training, outdoor environments, or sport-specific skills."
