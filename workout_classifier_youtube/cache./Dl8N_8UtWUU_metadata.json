    "I\u2019ve been working out with Maddie for 2 years. Maddie was the first online instructor I found, and I never worked out with anyone else after that! My journey started because of negative body image, but now I workout to get stronger! I\u2019ve gotten to the point where i follow my own workout plans and lift heavy weights. And it\u2019s all because of maddie! She\u2019s taught me so many exercises and the correct form for it all. But most of all, she has changed my mindset! I\u2019ve grown so much in my fitness journey. Thank you Maddie for all that you are! You make me feel strong and confident!",
