  "description": "Standing Pilates Cardio & Abs Workout | 20 Min Dance Inspired Workout\n\nWelcome to class! This workout will boost your heart rate as you move through a series of standing Pilates and simple dance inspired exercises which will work the core, hips, legs, glutes, shoulders, arms and back. It's a full body session to give you a boost of endorphins without using any high impact exercises. Low impact on the joints with high intensity movements that require concentration and focus and may leave you a little sweaty! A great workout for mind and body, especially if you're feeling sluggish and need motivation. The class is based on my Pilates and Dance background and mixes very simple dance and pilates exercises for a fun and functional workout that will leave you feeling fully awake and ready for your day. \n\nPlease click the Like button and Subscribe to the channel to help me make more films just for you.  \n\nHave a wonderful day,\nMuch love,  Rachel  \u2764\ufe0f\n#girlwiththepilatesmat  #standingpilates #danceworkout #cardioworkout \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, feel free to buy me a coffee to show your support: \nhttps://ko-fi.com/thegirlwiththepilatesmat\n\nI am currently featured in the Stay in, Work out campaign with Sport England here:\nhttps://www.sportengland.org/jointhemovement#get_active_at_home\n\nIf you'd like to join my live online classes via Zoom, pop to my website for details;\nhttp://www.rachellawrencepilates.com\n\nWant to keep in touch?

    "Loving the Cardio classes, I do these in between your weekly Monday and Friday live sessions.  Thank you Rachel.  Good balance challenges too.  Not sure if it was my connection or your connection but a couple of times the video jumped on the second half of the class.  Kind regards B",
    "Love love love it!~ Had a bit of trouble at the end as Im waiting on knee replacement but still could do the stretches!  Thank you!",
    "Rachel, Wow this was a great one! I am 76 and recently had both knees replaced.  I can do so much more than before!  I mostly do senior workouts but sometimes I try more advanced ones and can do quite a bit!  Thanks so much!  My knee procedures were so much easier since I had been doing pilates with you for such a long time!"
