No props needed!\n\ud83d\udc8e PRODUCT LAUNCH \ud83d\udc8e AFFIRMATION CARDS + YOGA JOURNAL \ud83d\udc49 https://bit.ly/ywkshop\n\u2764\ufe0f NEW MOBILE APP \u2764\ufe0f FREE TO DOWNLOAD\ud83d\udcf2 \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/ytmobileapp\n\nHi friends, this week I'm offering you a 30 minute practice perfect for beginners! Now just because a class is for beginners, doesn't mean it isn't challenging! We are going to work on building foundational strength, balance and flexibility. The great thing about this practice is that there are no props necessary and it's great for all experience levels.\n\nIf you're new to yoga, remember that the most important thing is to stay focused on your breath. Don't worry if you don't get all the poses correctly or if you need to take a break. Be patient with yourself, do what you can and remember to relax. This is a wonderful class to alleviate stress and anxiety.\n\n\u2705 SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET  http://bit.ly/ywkassandra\n\ud83d\udd14 Don\u2019t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!\n\nThanks for watching,\nKassandra\nWEB \u27a1\ufe0f http://www.yogawithkassandra.com\nINSTAGRAM \u27a1\ufe0f https://instagram.com/yoga_with_kassandra\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 MY MOBILE APP \ud83d\udcf1 Stream or download more than 800+ classes, use the in-app calendar to track and schedule classes, new exclusive challenges, classes and programs added every month \u2764\ufe0f FREE TO DOWNLOAD \u2764\ufe0f http://bit.ly/ytmobileapp\n\n\nFREE YOGA CHALLENGES\n\ud83c\udf1e 30 day Morning Yoga Challenge http://bit.ly/morning30days\n\ud83c\udf1b 30 day Evening Yoga Challenge: http://bit.ly/bedtime30\n\ud83e\uddd8 7 day Yoga & Meditation Challenge: http://bit.ly/ywk7day\n\ud83e\udd38 30 day Flexible Body, Flexible Mind Challenge: https://bit.ly/flexbodymind\n\n\nMY PUBLISHED BOOKS & PRODUCTS\n\ud83c\udf3f \"Year of Yoga\" (NEW Book+ Online Program): https://geni.us/yearofyoga\n\ud83c\udfb4 \"I Radiate Joy\" Affirmation Card Deck: https://bit.ly/affirmationdeck\n\u270d\ufe0f \"My Yoga Journey\" Guided Yoga Journal: https://bit.ly/ywkyogajournal\n\ud83d\udcd5 \"Yin Yoga: Stretch the Mindful Way\" Book: http://geni.us/ywkbook\n\ud83c\udf81 \"My Yoga Journey\" GIFT SET journal, candle + book: https://geni.us/giftsetywk\n\n\n\ud83d\uded2 SHOP MY AMAZON FAVORITES \ud83d\udecd\ufe0f\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/yogawithkassandra\n\n\nSTUDY WITH ME\n\ud83c\udf93 30 hour Yin Yoga Teacher Training: https://bit.ly/yinyttkass\n\ud83c\udf93 10 hour Vinyasa Teaching Methodologies: https://bit.ly/yttvinyasa\n\ud83d\udd49\ufe0f 10 hour Yoga Philosophy Course: https://bit.ly/ywkyama\n\u26a1 10 hour Tantra Wisdom Goddesses Course: https://bit.ly/wisdomgoddess\n\n\nYoga with Kassandra - Disclaimer\nPlease consult with your physician before beginning any exercise program.

    "I\u2019ve been doing yoga for 30 years.  You are the most in tuned teacher I\u2019ve ever come across.  You have an absolute gift and emit the most gentle and accepting energy.  I\u2019m so grateful for your classes.  Absolutely wonderful.  Thank you xoxo",
    "Can I just say how awesome this is? My daughter has PE as a class and she\u2019s required to exercise for 30 minutes a day. I\u2019ve decided to do it with her so I can lose weight and gain some more confidence. We had SO much fun doing this together. We giggled as things we couldn\u2019t do and congratulated on things we could do. We are excited (well I am) to do it again tomorrow! After we get good at this, we will try another video!",
    "I\u2019m not a beginner. I did yoga almost everyday for 2.5 years after finding this channel. 2023 brought me a break up, a job shift, and a whole dark-night-of-the-soul experience. I stopped doing yoga all together. It feels strange to come back to a beginner class but this also feels like exactly the place I need to start. Your message at the end reaffirmed this! Thank you for this class \u2764",
    "I don&#39;t realize how much my body is tense and how much i hold my breath until you say, &quot;Relax your head and shoulders..take a deep breath in&quot; etc. Thanks! It really helps me when you tell us to relax and breathe!",
    "This video changed my life! I started 10 weeks ago\u2026I only made it 16 minutes the fist time trying. Ten weeks later I can do this plus a 10 min energize practice in the morning and do another 30 minute evening practice before bed. I\u2019m 52 years old and had rotator cuff and back surgery less than 2 years ago and never thought I gain any strength or flexibility back. You are patient and kind and an amazing instructor. You encouraged me to just keep trying. I\u2019m far from anything beyond a beginner but I\u2019m farther than I\u2019d ever thought I\u2019d be. Thank you so much! I encourage everyone to subscribe and follow. Work all the beginner practices until you find the style and routines you like. You won\u2019t be sorry :)"
