  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Weight workout,' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is based on clear indications in the title and description, such as 'Strength Training' and the emphasis on using 'dumbbells' ranging from 15lbs to 45lbs, which suggests a focus on lifting weights for full-body strength training. The phrase 'moderately heavy' also supports this categorization.\n\nAdditionally, a secondary category of 'Body weight' is included with a lower score of 0.4, due to exercises like 'Plank Walk,' 'Side Plank with Knee Pull,' and 'V-Sit Arnold Press' mentioned in the exercise list, which may partially rely on body weight. However, this aspect is less central to the workout, hence the lower score.\n\nOther categories like 'HIIT' or 'Mat' were not chosen as the workout is distinctly structured around functional strength using weights, without emphasis on high-intensity intervals or mat-based exercises alone. The no-repeat structure and specified rest periods further distance it from typical HIIT workouts."
