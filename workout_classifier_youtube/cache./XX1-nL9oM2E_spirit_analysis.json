  "spiritsExplanation": "The video '15 Min FULL BODY CALISTHENICS WORKOUT at Home | No Equipment' primarily embodies the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. This is evidenced by the description, which highlights a 'follow along' format and the systematic provision of beginner and advanced variations, indicating a structured method designed to build strength methodically. The moderate score of 0.75 reflects the strong yet slightly implicit indicators of a disciplined approach, particularly for beginners.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also present with a score of 0.6, as the mention of music specifically by Epidemic Sound suggests an incorporation of rhythmic components that add a dynamic element to the workout, enhancing the mind-body connection.\n\nFinally, 'High-Energy & Intense' is given a score of 0.5. Although the workout is only 15 minutes long, the focus on full body engagement, strength building, and muscle gain suggests a moderate level of intensity. The inclusion of advanced variations indicates that the workout is adaptable to more intense efforts, supporting this classification.\n\nOther spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to lack of emphasis on relaxation or an outdoor setting. Similarly, 'Sport & Agility' is not relevant since there is no specific focus on sports skills or agility training."
