  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as 'Meditation' with very high confidence (score 0.9) because the title explicitly mentions 'Mindfulness Meditation' and the description further reinforces this with phrases like 'mindfulness meditation to powerfully restore and re-connect with the present'. Additionally, the tags include 'meditation', 'mindfulness', 'mindful', and 'guided meditation', pointing towards a strong presence of meditation themes. \n\n'Breathing exercises' is included with moderate confidence (score 0.6) as the video likely incorporates breathing techniques, common in mindfulness practices. Several tags and comments refer to breathing and relaxation, suggesting its mild presence.\n\nThe 'Other' category is assigned a low score (0.2) to account for any general relaxation elements not strictly covered by Meditation or Breathing, although this is primarily a meditation session. The overall high views and likes also corroborate its classification as a meditative session, highlighting its intended purpose of enhancing calm and mindfulness."
