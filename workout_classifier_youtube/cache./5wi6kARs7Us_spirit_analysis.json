  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout prominently aligns with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as evidenced by the strong language in the title ('Lose 10 Pounds in a WEEK'), tags ('fast weight loss', 'hardcore', 'extreme'), and description (e.g., 'very intense', 'go all out'). This indicates a workout designed to maximize effort and push physical limits, justifying a high score (0.9). The emphasis on rapid weight loss and extreme intensity supports a classification with very high confidence.\n\nSecondly, this workout also exhibits elements of the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The description outlines a clear and specific interval pattern ('30-20-10 rest pyramid'), with specific goals for stride speed (SPM) and structured schedules (e.g., 'do at least 2 sets,' 'repeat 1-to-3 times'), all pointing to methodical and regimented training. This results in a moderate score (0.6) as these elements are secondary to the overall intense nature but still significant.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded due to the focus on high intensity and discipline without mention of music-driven pacing or relaxation aspects."
