  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is clearly centered around using an exercise bike, as indicated by the title ('Stationary Bike Workout'), description, and tags ('stationary bike', 'exercise bike workout'). The description explicitly states that the workout involves an 'exercise bike workout in VR' and highlights the use of the Tabata protocol on the bike. The repeated mention of 'stationary bike', 'indoor cycling', and similar terms throughout the metadata indicates very high confidence (0.95) that an exercise bike is required for this workout."
