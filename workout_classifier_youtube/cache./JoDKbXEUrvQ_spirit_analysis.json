  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this video is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is due to the focus on pranayama, which involves deep breathing exercises aimed at stress release, calming the mind, and recovery - all qualities that are restorative in nature. The video description and multiple user comments highlight calming and stress-relief benefits, suggesting a soothing practice.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a moderate score of 0.5. Although this is not a traditional flow like a vinyasa yoga class, the breathing exercises do require a rhythmic, coordinated breathing pattern, especially with practices like bhastrika and kapalbhati.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded. This video lacks high-energy activities and, while structured, it does not focus on technical precision but rather on the experiential aspect of breath control. The comments from older people and those recovering from health issues further reinforce the spirit's soothing nature."
