  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under 'Stretching' due to strong evidence in the title, description, and tags, such as 'full body stretch', 'stretch for flexibility', and 'calming stretch routine'. These elements clearly indicate that the focus is on a full-body stretching routine intended for flexibility and stress relief. This warrants a high score of 0.9 for the 'Stretching' category. \n\nThe 'Yoga' category is also applicable, albeit with slightly less emphasis. While tags like '20 min calming yoga' and 'minimal talking yoga' suggest elements of yoga, the lack of specific yoga postures or techniques in the description results in a moderate score of 0.6. The video's intention to provide a calming experience aligns with yoga practices, further justifying its inclusion.\n\nOther categories were considered but excluded due to the strong overarching theme of stretching and stress relief, and absence of typical indicators for mat exercises, meditation, or other workout categories."
