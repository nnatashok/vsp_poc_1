  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises in this workout video are described as low impact and simple, suggesting a Beginner technique difficulty. Movements like 'curtsey drop', 'silent burpee to toes', and 'step out jacks' are straightforward and require minimal coordination, aligning with Beginner classification. However, exercises like 'single leg down dog to hover' and 'side plank lift to arm sweep' suggest a slightly higher complexity, giving a moderate score to Intermediate as well.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video explicitly states 'low intensity' and 'steady state cardio', which strongly aligns with a Light effort difficulty classification. The absence of rest periods and the continuous 20-minute format adds a slight increase in effort, suggesting a possibility for Moderate classification for some individuals. However, the overall low intensity and impact of the exercises primarily support a Light classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is designed to be accessible, with 'low intensity' and 'low impact' highlighted, aligning well with a Beginner fitness level. The duration of just over 20 minutes and the presence of exercises with a bit more complexity like 'alternating side plank to push up' provide a basis for Intermediate classification as well. Channel audience feedback and the nature of exercises suggest minimal barriers for intrigued beginners, but a slight exposure to similar routines could enhance experience, hinting at lower Advanced applicability especially for improved endurance and technique challenge."
