  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is designed for post-meal activity, indicating a low-intensity, gentle approach suitable for aiding digestion, which strongly aligns with 'The Comfort Moves' vibe. The title, description, and tags emphasize ease, with phrases like 'simple, body-weight exercises' and 'not hard to do,' suggesting a focus on safe, feel-good movement and emphasizing avoiding discomfort with a full stomach. This justifies a strong score of 0.8 for this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, the focus on calorie burning without intense movement aligns it with 'The Reboot Workout.' The description mentions performing it after every meal, suggesting a refreshing regimen that suits the low-stress characteristic of this vibe. The combination of gentle exercises (like 'high knee twist', 'side bends', and 'arm circles' from the comments) supports this classification, though the score is 0.6 due to a slightly lesser emphasis on total body refreshment versus calorie burn.\n\nOther vibes were excluded due to the lack of indicators of high intensity, speed, or extreme focus on skill development."
