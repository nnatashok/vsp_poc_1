  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "This workout video, titled '20 Minute Full Body Strength Workout (No Equipment/No Repeat)', is explicitly designed to be performed without any equipment. The title, tags, and description consistently emphasize that no equipment is required. Phrases like 'strength workout without equipment', 'full body strength workout no equipment', and 'time under tension workout no equipment' in the tags reinforce the bodyweight nature of the session. The description further states, 'requires no equipment', confirming that the workout is intended to be completed using only body weight. Although the description mentions optional equipment like dumbbells, kettlebells, or a weight vest to increase difficulty for advanced users, these are not necessary for performing the workout as designed. Therefore, the classification confidently identifies this workout as bodyweight only."
