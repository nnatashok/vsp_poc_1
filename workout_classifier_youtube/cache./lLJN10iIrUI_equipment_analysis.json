  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is designed for seniors and beginners, with a focus on accessibility and ease of use. The title, tags, and description all emphasize this, with specific references to 'senior chair exercises' and 'chair exercises for seniors.' The description also explicitly states that the workout can be performed 'standing or in a chair,' which points to the chair being a central component of the workout for those who need or prefer a seated option. As such, a chair is likely the only equipment required, with a high confidence score of 0.75, because it's strongly implied to be an integral part of the exercise, even though it's not mandatory for every participant. No other specific equipment is mentioned or suggested elsewhere in the metadata."
