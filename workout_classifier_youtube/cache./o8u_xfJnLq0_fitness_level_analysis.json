  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The title suggests the workout is 'beginner friendly,' and it's a Pilates workout, which typically involves simple yet effective movements that are accessible to beginners. The channel owner is a certified Pilates instructor, indicating she likely provides clear instructions suitable for beginners. High engagement and positive comments from beginners corroborate that the technique required is straightforward. While Pilates can have its complexities, the beginner-friendly tag and 20-minute duration suggest movements are on the simpler side, justifying the 'Beginner' rating with a secondary 'Intermediate' score as Pilates also often includes elements that can challenge coordination and balance slightly beyond basic movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is under 20 minutes, which keeps the effort relatively low, consistent with a 'Moderate' level. User comments mention a 'burn' and the feeling that the workout is effective, which indicates some level of intensity, likely pushing it slightly toward 'Challenging' for very deconditioned individuals. However, the lack of equipment and Pilates' typically controlled movements generally suggest more moderate exertion, but with the potential to elevate to 'Challenging' based on individual fitness level or intensity adjustments made by the practitioner.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The video is described as 'beginner friendly,' which strongly supports a 'Beginner' fitness level. Despite being accessible to beginners, Pilates' inherent elements can also challenge those at an 'Intermediate' level. As reflected in user comments, even individuals with moderate experience find it beneficial and return to it as part of their routine, indicating its ongoing effectiveness at this level. The slight 'Advanced' score acknowledges that regular practice could enhance or maintain fitness without being overwhelming, as the workout can be intensified based on execution or repetition."
