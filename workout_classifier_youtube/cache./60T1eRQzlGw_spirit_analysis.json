  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is predominantly characterized by the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. This is inferred from the title 'Energising Mat Pilates' and the description's promise of leaving participants feeling 'strong and energised'. Additionally, the channel's background in dance and Pilates suggests a focus on coordinated and smooth movement, further indicated by words like \"feel good pilates\" in the tags. The music element mentioned in user comments also supports this choice. The moderate score of 0.75 reflects a strong but slightly implicit association.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also complemented by 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.60. The structured nature of Pilates, as implied by terms like \"intermediate pilates,\" and the reference to a \"well-thought and challenging class\" in comments supports this classification. The well-defined structure of Pilates sessions provides a methodical approach to training, hence the high confidence.\n\nAdditionally, there is a notable 'Soothing & Restorative' aspect, scoring 0.45. Although not the primary focus, Pilates inherently includes elements of relaxation and strength in a low-impact manner. The phrase \"feel good\" and the emphasis on progressive body awareness and control contribute to this classification. However, the focus on energy and strength limits its score to moderate."
