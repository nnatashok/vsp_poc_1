  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of calisthenics exercises that aim to build skills like the human flag and planche, which are advanced in nature. However, the actual exercises may vary in complexity. Keywords like 'calisthenics exercises for beginners' suggest some simpler movements are also included. Therefore, the technique difficulty is placed between Intermediate and Advanced, with a stronger emphasis on Intermediate due to the broad outreach to 'all levels'.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 20 minutes long with a structure of 40 seconds active work and 20 seconds rest. This tempo suggests moderate intensity by general standards, but considering the target audience, it can be quite challenging. The expressions 'full body workout', 'full energy', and user comments indicating significant effort imply a noticeable exertion level. The effort difficulty is classified as Moderate to Challenging.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "While the video is tagged as suitable for beginners, it also targets viewers interested in progressing toward advanced calisthenics skills. The 20-minute duration and interval structure suggest a more intermediate level is optimal, though less fit viewers might still attempt it with pauses. Some comments mention difficulty, reinforcing the need for some baseline fitness. Given the variability in exercises and self-scroll nature of calisthenics, it is suitable for multiple fitness levels, primarily Intermediate, but accessible to Beginners with some caution."
