  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is the primary classification for this workout video based on multiple indicators in the metadata. The title, 'Guided Meditation For Powerful Positivity,' and the description highlight themes of peace, focus, positivity, and healing, all aligning with restorative qualities. Tags such as 'guided meditation for stress,' 'meditation for anxiety,' and 'quick meditation for peace' further reinforce the emphasis on calming and restorative outcomes. Furthermore, the description specifically mentions letting go of stress, anxiety, and negativity, supporting a restorative intent. While the channel is broadly focused on yoga and fitness, the video itself is clearly centered on meditation and inner peace. High confidence is assigned due to the strong explicit foundational evidence in both the title and description. Other spirits were not considered relevant as the content does not emphasize movement, intensity, or athleticism typical of other categories."
