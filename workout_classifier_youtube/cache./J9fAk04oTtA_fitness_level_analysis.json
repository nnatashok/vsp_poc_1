  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of cycling with varying intensities, including seated and out-of-saddle portions, which require some technical skill, especially for maintaining proper form during high-intensity segments. Intermediate level is most appropriate due to the balance and coordination required during the 'out of the saddle' efforts. Advanced technique rating is also included as maintaining form under high effort, such as VO2 max intervals, typically demands more from participants in terms of body control and cycling efficiency.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is an intense 45-minute session focusing on VO2 max, which is stated to help improve maximum oxygen uptake, indicating high energy expenditure and cardiovascular demand. The duration, intensity, and inclusion of repeated high-effort intervals (such as 6 sets of 2-minute segments) suggest a Challenging to Extreme effort difficulty. The need for long recovery after high-intensity intervals further emphasizes the demanding nature of the workout.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The Intermediate level is appropriate because it indicates participants should have some basic fitness foundation due to the workout's cardiovascular demand and relatively complex coordination required. An Advanced level rating is necessary, given the high-intensity nature of the intervals and the overall workout duration exceeding 40 minutes, which suggests it may overwhelm those who are only modestly active. The combination of intermediate and advanced ratings ensures coverage for those improving their cycling fitness or experienced with indoor cycling."
