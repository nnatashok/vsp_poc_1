  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is strongly aligned with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, with extremely high confidence (0.95). The title \"Restorative Yoga For Stress Relief | 30 Minute Practice\" explicitly highlights the intention of the video to soothe and restore. The description reinforces this by stating it is a \"calming yoga routine\" designed to \"de-stress\" and includes \"gentle and simple full body stretches for relaxation.\" Each pose is held for around 2 minutes to aid in slowing down the mind and body, further supporting the restorative nature of the practice. The use of props like pillows or blocks also suggests a gentler, more supportive approach. Comments from users frequently mention stress relief, calming effects, and peace, underscoring the restorative qualities experienced by viewers. Other potential spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are less applicable here, as the focus is not on choreography, intensity, or technical progressions, but rather on achieving a peaceful state."
