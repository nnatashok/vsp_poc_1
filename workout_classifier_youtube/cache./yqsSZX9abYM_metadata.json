  "channelDescription": "Helping ladies lose weight with PCOS & reverse their symptoms, gluten & dairy free!\n\nHi! I\u2019m Tallene, and I was diagnosed with PCOS at age 18. I remember kickboxing twice a day and not losing a single pound; being miserable and moody from cutting calories and carbs with no results; and desperately asking my doctor for more information on how to manage my diagnosis\u2014just to hear that birth control was my only option. (Wrong!)\n\nFrustrated by the lack of information out there, I spent the next ten years learning everything I could about the disorder. I became a registered dietitian, went gluten and dairy free, and met and married a very cute PCOS personal trainer (hi Sirak!). \n\nTogether, we\u2019ve distilled my decade of learning the hard way into the largest community of women reversing PCOS, The Cysterhood App, so that we can help you and others skip the struggle and regain control of your health and happiness right now!\n\nWelcome to my channel Cyster!",

    "Started doing these exercises on January 18th at 110 kg. Today\u2019s January 26th, I\u2019m down 3.4 kg! There\u2019s a looong way to go as I would like to lose up to 60 kg, but the first step has been made!<br>I\u2019m tracking what I eat, trying to not overpass 1490 calories, and consume 131 g of protein, 66 g of fat, and 93 of carbs. I\u2019m not reaching these points most of the days, though. Eating more balanced meals, more berries, fruit, veggies. Exercising every other day. Still trying to implement walks in between those days. <br>Good luck to everyone trying to achieve their goals! We got this! \u2764\ufe0f"
