  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of stretching exercises aimed specifically at improving flexibility for splits, which are inherently beginner-friendly as they involve basic static stretches focusing on hamstrings and hips. While the stretches are simple and low-risk in nature, achieving splits requires gradual progression and might involve intermediate elements due to flexibility demands. The description emphasizes this being a 'BEGINNERS guide', supporting a beginner rating with some moderate coordination needed for precise hip and leg alignment, hence the minor inclusion of intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort required for this workout is low, typical of static stretches focusing on flexibility. Sessions are short and not designed to increase heart rate significantly or cause substantial energy expenditure, therefore classified primarily as 'Light'. However, for users not used to sustained stretching or who lack flexibility, maintaining positions might demand slightly more effort, hence an additional 'Moderate' consideration.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the beginner nature of the stretching routine and its focus on flexibility enhancement rather than high intensity or complex exercises, it is highly suitable for beginners who are new to exercise or very deconditioned. However, achieving splits requires persistence and flexibility, indicating a slight relevance for intermediates who need to maintain consistency over time. The emphasis in the description on beginners supports the primary beginner level with an additional mild intermediate consideration."
