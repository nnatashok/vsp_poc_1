  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is best described by the vibes 'The Zen Flow' and 'The Reboot Workout'. The title and description suggest a yoga session designed for beginners, emphasizing gentle stretches and foundational poses, which aligns well with 'The Zen Flow'. The focus on simple, effective poses for improving flexibility and strength suggests a grounding and intentional practice. The description highlights the inclusion of breathing techniques and mindful movements, further supporting the 'Zen Flow' vibe as the session seems unhurried and breath-centered. The frequent use of terms like 'gentle', 'peace and relaxation', and guidance through the basics of yoga also substantiate this classification.\n\n'\\n\\nAdditionally, the brief duration and emphasis on refreshing and revitalizing effect strongly resonate with 'The Reboot Workout', which is characterized by low-stress and total-body refresh routines. This vibe is scored slightly lower yet still significant as the 10-minute routine is meant to offer a quick reset and ease participants into yoga.\n\nTags like 'easy yoga', 'quick yoga', and comments mentioning its suitability for senior citizens suggest an approachable and comfortable experience for a wider range of participants, reinforcing the chosen vibes and excluding more intense styles like 'The Warrior Workout'. The confidence level is high given the explicit cues from the title, description, and comments sections."
