  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe, 'The Deep Recharge,' was chosen based on multiple explicit indicators of breathwork being used to alleviate stress and anxiety, as seen in the title and description noting 'Feel Calm and Focused,' 'reduce stress,' and 'enhance focus.' This aligns strongly with a deep-root nervous system reset, thus earning a high score of 0.9 for its perfect embodiment.\n\nThe 'Reboot Workout' vibe aligns due to the focus on gentle, deep breathing for relaxation and mental clarity, fitting the 'total-body refresh' concept. The term 'gateway to mindfulness' and the intention to 'improve your life in various ways' align with this vibe, scoring a 0.7.\n\n'Zen Flow' is relevant due to the grounding and intentional aspect of the guided breathwork session, aimed at mental clarity and calm, elements of which mirror a grounding vibe, thus receiving a score of 0.6.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' were considered but excluded given the shorter duration video and lack of repetitive endurance quality in the metadata. Likewise, 'The Sleep Prep' was not selected despite the calming aspect because the explicit goal wasn't sleep preparation."
