  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Guided Breathing: Awaken Your Nervous System' appears to focus solely on breathwork, as indicated in both the title and description. The video is described as a guided breathwork session, and the channel is dedicated to teaching breathwork and movement. There is no mention in the title, description, tags, or comments about any physical equipment being used or required. Breathwork typically does not require any physical equipment, relying solely on breathing techniques and sometimes a comfortable sitting or lying position. None of the listed equipment items are applicable here. Thus, the workout appears to be a bodyweight-only exercise session with no equipment needed."
