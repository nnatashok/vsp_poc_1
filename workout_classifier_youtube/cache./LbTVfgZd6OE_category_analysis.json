  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily focused on stretching and recovery, as explicitly mentioned multiple times in the title (\"Stretch, Relax & Recover Workout\"), description, and tags (e.g., \"stretch workout\", \"recovery workout\", \"stretch routine\"). The workout is designed as a 30-minute session for relaxation and recovery, aligning with the Stretching category. The use of yoga-related tags like \"yoga stretch full body\", \"yoga stretching exercises\", and \"yoga stretches for flexibility\" indicates a secondary focus on yoga-inspired stretches, supporting the Yoga category albeit with less emphasis than general stretching. The description confirms that the workout is about stretching and relaxing, making Stretching the primary category with a 0.9 score. Yoga is given a 0.6 score, recognizing its influence but not as the main focus. The use of terms such as \"mobility\" and \"yoga stretching exercises\" justifies the inclusion of these categories and explains the exclusion of more intense or equipment-based categories. The confidence in these classifications is very high due to clear and explicit metadata references."
