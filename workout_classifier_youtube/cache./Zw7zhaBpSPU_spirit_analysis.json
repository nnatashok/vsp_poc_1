  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.8 due to the nature of Pilates, which often emphasizes smooth, controlled movements and a mind-body connection. The description mentions low-impact movements focused on flexibility, strength, and mobility, all aligning with the fluidity characteristic of this spirit. The workout is also marked by elements of 'Structured & Disciplined', receiving a score of 0.6, as Pilates routines typically follow a structured format to ensure proper technique and progression in strength and flexibility. References to a '30-minute pilates class' and the use of a certified instructor reinforce this structure. Additionally, 'Soothing & Restorative' receives a score of 0.5 as the workout is described as energizing and suitable for recovery, with commenters mentioning its moderate challenge level. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the non-intense, low-impact nature of Pilates seen here."
