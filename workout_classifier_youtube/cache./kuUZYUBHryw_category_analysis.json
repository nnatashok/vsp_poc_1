  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized primarily under 'Calisthenics' due to explicit mentions throughout the metadata, including the title, tags, and description, affirming that it's a beginner calisthenics workout intended for home use without equipment. Terms such as 'beginner calisthenics', 'calisthenics workout', and 'full body calisthenics' repeat in the tags, emphasizing this category. Additionally, the exercise style matches the characteristics of calisthenics, focusing on strength and mobility using body weight.\n\nThe 'Body weight' category is also relevant. While calisthenics inherently involves body weight exercises, the description highlights \"bodyweight strength\" and \"full body bodyweight workout no equipment,\" justifying its inclusion with a moderate score. The focus is specifically on using one's own body resistance, aligning with traits distinct to body weight workouts.\n\nConfidence in this classification is very high due to coherent and consistent metadata across multiple fields supporting these two categories."
