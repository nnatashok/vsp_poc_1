  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout combines Pilates movements with cardio flows, which suggests a blend of low to moderate complexity. Pilates typically involves controlled movements and body awareness, which requires some coordination. The description and comments highlight that the workout is approachable and well-instructed, yet users report being challenged, indicating an intermediate level is suitable. Pilates itself can range from beginner to intermediate depending on execution, and the metadata does not suggest advanced techniques.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves cardio Pilates which inherently raises heart rate, indicating a moderate to challenging energy level. The 30-minute duration suggests a sustained effort above light intensity. User comments describe the workout as 'nice calm' yet 'butt kicked,' indicating a moderate to challenging effort. The mix of Pilates and athletic cardio could be challenging for deconditioned users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The combination of beginner to intermediate technique difficulty and moderate effort makes this workout suitable for beginners to intermediates, especially those familiar with basic Pilates. Some users may find it approachable yet challenging, warranting an intermediate level inclusion due to the cardio element. It's less appropriate for complete beginners without any exercise background but serves well for those with minimal exercise exposure. Advanced users may find it beneficial if seeking a lighter day workout or for Pilates practice, though it's likely not sufficiently intense for elite users."
