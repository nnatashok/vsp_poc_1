  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is predominantly classified as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to several factors: the title mentions 'Morning Yoga - Yoga at Home to FEEL GREAT,' which implies a flowing, seamless practice designed to uplift and enhance mood. The description further reinforces this with terms like 'vinyasa flow,' 'full body yoga class,' and 'flow with me,' which highlight the continuous and rhythmic nature of the session. Tags such as 'vinyasa flow yoga class,' 'yoga flow,' and 'feel good flow' confirm this focus, supporting a high confidence level of 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nThe workout also aligns with 'Soothing & Restorative,' indicated by comments saying the practice is 'relaxing and calming,' and is described as helping users feel 'calmer and grounded.' Such feedback suggests a restorative element, likely involving gentle stretches and relaxation. The class is said to 'help you set the tone for the rest of your day,' emphasizing its grounding and calming impact. Therefore, a score of 0.7 is assigned due to this mixed but clear intention.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the absence of any mentions of high intensity, athleticism, or performance-based training."
