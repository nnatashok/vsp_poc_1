  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "This workout is a 20-minute yoga practice, as explicitly stated in both the title ('Full Body Flow | 20-Minute Yoga Practice') and description ('Full Body Yoga Flow'), which typically requires a mat for floor exercises and to provide a stable, non-slip surface. The tags provided such as 'yoga at home', 'yoga for beginners', and 'full body yoga' further reinforce this requirement. Additionally, the channel 'Yoga With Adriene' is known for home yoga practices, suggesting a mat is essential for comfort and safety. Therefore, I assigned a very high confidence score of 1.0 for the need for a mat."
