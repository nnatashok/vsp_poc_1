  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.75. This is due to the nature of the workout, which uses clearly defined run intervals and recovery phases, as mentioned in the description and implied by the title '30 MIN BEGINNER RUN INTERVALS'. The use of specific time markers in the description for warm-up, workout, and cool down further reinforces this as a structured workout.\n\nFlow & Rhythm receives a score of 0.6 due to the use of music to accompany the workout, indicated by the listed songs in the description. This helps maintain a rhythmic flow, making the intervals more engaging and helping to connect mind and body during the session.\n\nHigh-Energy & Intense is given a score of 0.4, as the incorporation of running intervals naturally adds an element of intensity, though it is moderated for beginners. User comments also mention motivation and energy as key aspects of completing the full session.\n\nOther spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to the indoor, treadmill-based setup and the focus on structured running rather than recovery or exploration."
