  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The meditation workout video titled 'Daily Calm | 10 Minute Mindfulness Meditation | Forgetting Time' appears to be a guided mindfulness meditation session led by Tamara Levitt, focusing on the importance of forgetting time. There is no explicit mention of any physical equipment in the video title, description, or tags. Meditation practices generally do not require physical workout equipment, and based on the metadata provided, this video aligns with that purpose.\n\nComments from viewers mention meditation in a home environment, such as on a 'rug,' but this does not suggest specialized equipment beyond potentially a comfortable resting place, which could be as simple as a carpet or space on the floor. No exercise or movement is implied that would require typical gym or workout equipment. \n\nHence, the video is classified as requiring no additional equipment, suggesting a bodyweight-only practice focused on mental relaxation rather than physical exertion."
