  "spiritsExplanation": "The spirits for this workout video were primarily identified as 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined'. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is evidenced by the nature of Pilates, which often involves continuous, smooth movements that encourage a mind-body connection. This is further supported by the channel's history of incorporating dance and rhythm elements, as the creator is a former Latin Ballroom dancer and gymnast, which likely influences her workout style.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is indicated by the disciplined nature of Pilates itself, which emphasizes technical precision and methodical progression through various movements. The description mentions different variations, suggesting a structured approach catering to various skill levels. Additionally, user comments highlight the precision and guidance of the instructor, suggesting a structured and focused engagement in the practice.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were not chosen due to the emphasis on accessibility and core strengthening, rather than high intensity or calming relaxation."
