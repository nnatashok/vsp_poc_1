  "spiritsExplanation": "The video 'Rolling With The Hills | 45 Mins HIIT Indoor Cycling Workout' predominantly embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as indicated by the terms 'HIIT', 'push hard', 'high intensity', and the structured high exertion intervals (e.g., segments reaching 8/10 or 10/10 effort levels). These elements suggest a workout focused on maximum effort and heart-pumping intensity, meriting a strong score of 0.9 for this spirit. \n\nAdditionally, the workout embodies 'Structured & Disciplined' qualities, evident in the detailed breakdown of minute-by-minute intervals with specific resistance levels and RPMs. This methodical approach to cycling training merited a score of 0.7. \n\nThere is also an aspect of 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the continuous cycling motion and music used to guide the pace, giving it a moderate score of 0.5. Although the workout uses music and rhythmic movement, the more intense and structured elements predominate. Comments highlight the usage of structured effort and intensity, reinforcing these spirit choices."
