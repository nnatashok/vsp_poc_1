  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Comfort Moves' was chosen with a strong score of 0.9 due to the workout's focus on beginners and seniors, as mentioned in the title and description, emphasizing gentle strength building using light weights and an accommodating pace. The content is designed for safety and accessibility, which aligns with creating a safe and comfortable workout space for those who might be less experienced or have physical limitations, as reflected in user comments praising its suitability for sensitive joints.\n\n'Foundation Builder' was also selected, with a score of 0.8, as the session is described to be focused on building strength across major muscle groups using foundational exercises such as squats, shoulder presses, and bicep curls. The approach focuses on foundational fitness elements, essential for those starting or returning to exercise, which is evident in the guided variation of weights as described in the video description.\n\n'Progression Quest' and similar vibes were not chosen due to the workout's primary focus on entry-level strength building rather than long-term meticulous progression strategies, emphasizing immediate accessibility instead of structured progression plans."
