  "vibesExplanation": "The video strongly fits 'The Reboot Workout' vibe (0.85) as it is described as a stretching routine \"ideal post workout\" designed to help \"slow down after your training,\" facilitating a shift into the parasympathetic state for recovery and stress relief. The use of phrases like \"rest well and grow stronger\" emphasizes the restorative and refreshing nature, typical of a reboot session.\n\nIt also aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe (0.75) because the description and comments mention elements of calming and intentional practice, like activating a relaxed state and promoting mental stillness through yoga, which is consistent with grounding and breath-centered workouts.\n\nThe routine has elements of 'The Deep Recharge' vibe (0.7) due to its emphasis on engaging the parasympathetic nervous system and mindful movement, aiming to reset and decompress the body post intense activities.\n\nOther potential vibes, such as 'The Meditative Grind', were considered due to focus on mindfulness, but the lack of long-duration or endurance elements made them less fitting."
