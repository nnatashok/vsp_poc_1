  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title explicitly states that this is a '25 MIN FULL BODY PILATES WORKOUT FOR BEGINNERS (No Equipment)', indicating a bodyweight workout. However, the description specifies 'No equipment needed, just you and your mat', suggesting that a mat is used. This is common in Pilates workouts to provide comfort and support during floor exercises. The accompanying metadata, such as tags and the presence of a certified Pilates instructor, further supports this requirement, placing high confidence (0.9) on the need for a mat. No other equipment is mentioned or suggested, reinforcing the mat's presence as essential."
