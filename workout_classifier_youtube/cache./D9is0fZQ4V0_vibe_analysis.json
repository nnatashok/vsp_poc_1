  "vibesExplanation": "The video 'Extreme Fat Burning Workout - 50 Minute Indoor Cycling Class' strongly aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' due to the sustained 50-minute duration, the repetitive nature of cycling, and the focus on pedaling technique, suggesting a methodical and enduring experience (score: 0.75). The use of consistent, long efforts implies a grind-like quality.\n\nThe vibe 'The Endorphin Wave' is also relevant. The workout is described as challenging and designed for fat burning, implying an elevated energy and releasing endorphins as noted by comments such as 'killer spinning classes' and continuous improvement over time (score: 0.6).\n\nThere is a mild alignment with 'The Warrior Workout' due to mentions of the toughness and burning sensation which imply a physically demanding experience (score: 0.4). However, it lacks the primal or intensely aggressive energy typical of this classification, hence the lower score.\n\nThe workout's structured and rhythmic music also supports these vibe classifications. Overall, the data from the description, user comments, and channel focus support these selected vibes with high confidence."
