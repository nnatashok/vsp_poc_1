  "spiritsExplanation": "The assigned spirit 'High-Energy & Intense' is highly confident due to several indicators in the metadata. The title '10 Min Fat Burning Workout | No Equipment' and tags such as 'high intensity workouts', 'fatburning', and 'burn fat fast' emphasize a vigorous and challenging workout designed to maximize calorie burn and muscle endurance. Additionally, comments like 'This workout is so intensive' and 'you are getting stronger' highlight the workout's intense nature. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong match to this spirit.\n\nThe spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' is assigned with moderate confidence. The workout likely incorporates a sequence of exercises that may be fluid and rhythm-based, as indicated by the comment \"butt kicks,\" \"burpees,\" and \"jumping jacks.\" The tag 'routine' suggests continuity in the exercise flow, though it's not the primary focus, justifying a score of 0.5.\n\n'In addition, 'Structured & Disciplined' is included with moderate confidence. The description mentions systematic training to achieve 'real results,' indicating a structured approach. However, the primary emphasis is on intensity rather than strict technical progression, leading to a score of 0.4 for this spirit."
