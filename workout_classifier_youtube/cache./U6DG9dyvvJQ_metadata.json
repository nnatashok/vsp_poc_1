    "I started from just about 0, I couldn&#39;t even do a single push up. Now about a month later I can do a nice set of 10 regular push ups. Thank you for putting in all the work to put this workout plan together. Very much appreciated.",
    "Just got my first pull<br>Up in my entire life today after doing this program for 5 weeks!!!",
    "I just turned 60 but your passion for Callisthenics makes me feel 25. I am starting it baby! thank you",
    "I have an idea! Make a playlist for all the mobility/warm up exercise videos you have. Another one for one for skills and another one for strengthening. So it is easier to set up the format you mentioned in this video. This is an idea of course to make the channel a bit more user friendly. Thank you again! You rock!!!"
