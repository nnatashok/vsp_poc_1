  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Stretching,' with a high score of 0.9, due to the explicit mention of 'mobility stretches' and 'various upper and lower body stretching movements' in the title and description. The terms 'relieve muscle tension,' 'improve joint mobility,' and 'increase joints' range of motion' strongly suggest that the video focuses on flexibility and stretching exercises, which directly aligns with the 'Stretching' category. The metadata lacks any specific indicators of dynamic or strength-based exercises, dismissing categories such as 'Body weight' or 'Calisthenics.' Although there is a slight presence of general mobility exercises, the primary focus is clearly on stretching, hence the addition of 'Other' with a lower score of 0.3 to capture any elements of general mobility that do not strictly fit into the stretching category. Overall, the confidence in the 'Stretching' classification is very high, given the clear and focused content of improving flexibility and mobility."
