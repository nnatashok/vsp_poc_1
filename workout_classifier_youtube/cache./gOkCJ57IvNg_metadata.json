    "Fun fact: This is a high-quality remake of my VERY FIRST YouTube video on this channel!<br><br>Many of you already know this information, but I wanted an easy, thorough video that people could link their friends when talking about our fitness philosophy. I wanted this to be a good place for them to start! <br><br>Hope you&#39;re all well! <br><br>Fitness Routine:<br><a href=\"https://www.hybridcalisthenics.com/routine\">https://www.hybridcalisthenics.com/routine</a><br><br>NEW Book Version:<br><a href=\"https://www.hybridcalisthenics.com/book\">https://www.hybridcalisthenics.com/book</a>",

    "You&#39;re the only person I&#39;ve seen who doesn&#39;t make me feel like I should be ashamed for needing to start on &quot;easy&quot; things. Thank you.",
    "I feel like you&#39;re one of the only health and fitness people on youtube that ive seen who actually really cares about being generally healthy and fit instead of trying to convinve you to join their classes. I feel like you really care about living healthy, and your videos are way more approachable than other over the top fitness youtubers. I appreciate your dedication<a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/m8MfY4jbFsWJhL0PyouA2Ak\"></a>",
    "A year ago I started with your routine. Pushups on the kitchen counter.  Wall pullups using the door frame. Followed through the progressions. Building that fundamental strength and discipline was the most important step in keeping up with my fitness journey. Now I can do dips and pull ups. I attribute my start to your videos and routine. Thank you for putting this information out there."
