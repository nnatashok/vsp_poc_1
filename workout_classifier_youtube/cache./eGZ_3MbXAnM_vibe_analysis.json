  "vibesExplanation": "The chosen vibes are primarily based on the workout's high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format, which is designed to deliver quick and impactful fitness benefits. \n\n1. **The Firestarter**: Scored 0.8, this vibe fits exceptionally well due to the fast-paced, intense bursts of effort during the 30-second max effort sprints, typical of explosive and electrifying workouts like Tabata. The title and description emphasize the 'quick & effective' nature, suggesting a workout that is short but intense, aligned with the Firestarter vibe.\n\n2. **The Warrior Workout**: Scored 0.7, as the workout involves pushing limits and unleashing primal energy through vigorous 30-second sprints. The encouragement to push through fitness plateaus and achieve maximum effort resonates with the 'inner beast' energy typical of a Warrior Workout.\n\n3. **The Endorphin Wave**: Assigned a score of 0.4 due to the feel-good aspect of completing a comprehensive session of warm-up, workout, and cool down, designed to energize and elevate mood. This aligns with the steady build-up and feel-good movement aspects of the Endorphin Wave.\n\nOverall, the detailed description, and user comments praising the intensity and effectiveness, reinforce these vibes, with high confidence in the first two selections."
