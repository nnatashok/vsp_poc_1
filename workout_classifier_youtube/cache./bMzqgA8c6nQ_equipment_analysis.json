  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a 20-minute guided meditation focused on chakra balancing and cleansing. The title, description, and tags indicate that the content is entirely related to a meditation practice without any physical movements that would require equipment. The absence of any mention of physical exercises, movement-based activities, or any props in the metadata suggests that no equipment is needed. The content is centered around mental and spiritual well-being rather than physical workout routines. Therefore, no equipment is required for this meditation session, indicating it's a bodyweight or seated practice only."
