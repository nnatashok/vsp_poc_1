    "This was a great quick workout",
    "Hi!!! Just found this video several days ago. I bought a treadmill in September of this year. When I began I was 568 pounds. Currently I&#39;m 516 and been at a plateau for a month now. When I first started I could barely walk a minute and that was at 1 mph. Currently I can walk six minutes and the max speed I can handle is 1.5 mph -1.9 mph. I have to hold on while I walk cuz I do have some balance issues. When you say start incline at 3 I start it at 1 then 1.5 by the six minute mark my heart rate is up and I&#39;m sweating. I know the more I practice the better I&#39;ll get. I&#39;m enjoying this workout. Thanks a million \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude0a",
    "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffbfelt great! Good for a quick workout.",
    "Another great program with Veronica! Her form cues are spot on(whenever she says roll the shoulders back...yep..mine are hunched up &amp; tense. Whenever she reminds us of our core...yep...my core is in lala land!). Thank you!!",
    "This was great! Quick, efficient, and fun"
