    "My 8 year old son loves your meditation. He meditate every morning and before bed and when school starts getting to hard to handle.",
    "I started crying when you said &quot;Let go, it&#39;s okay&quot;...thank you Juliana and Mark for all these wonderful meditations \u2764\ufe0f",
    "The background music is truly a work of god. <b>_</b>",
    "I didn&#39;t expect the wave of emotions to hit me. Usually my monkey brain won&#39;t still long enough to last thru a full meditation so it was crazy when I was sitting there and I found tears rolling down my face thinking bout things I haven&#39;t thought of in years. I guess I have a lot to let go. Maybe that&#39;s why mediation intimidates me so much. Its hard letting go of things you&#39;ve held onto for years. Wow what a video \u2764"
