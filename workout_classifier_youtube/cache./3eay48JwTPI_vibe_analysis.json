  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'LAZY GIRL Full Body WORKOUT - 7 min. (NO JUMPING)' from Vicky Justiz strongly aligns with 'The Comfort Moves' vibe due to its focus on being a low-intensity, low-impact, and apartment-friendly workout, specifically designed for those looking for a gentle fitness routine. The title and tags such as 'lazy girl workout,' 'no jumping,' and 'apartment friendly' heavily imply a calm, cozy workout session, perfectly fitting for someone seeking safe and non-demanding exercises.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Reboot Workout' is relevant here, as the description mentions it as an 'easy workout,' and it's designed to be accessible even in a limited space, which suggests a gentle total-body refresh without stress. The emphasis on comfort and ease, as highlighted by phrases like 'do half this workout in bed,' supports this vibe.\n\nThe high confidence in vibe assignment (0.9) is due to the clear and direct language used to define the workout's ease and accessibility, confirmed by user comments that appreciate its straightforward and manageable approach, highlighting encouragement and simplicity."
