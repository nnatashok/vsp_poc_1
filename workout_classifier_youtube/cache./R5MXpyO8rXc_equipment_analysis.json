  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as a '20 minute Full Body NO REPEAT Workout | Tone and Define with Dumbbells' in the title, indicating that dumbbells are required. Additionally, the description clearly states 'requires only moderately heavy dumbbells' and specifies that the host used weights ranging from 10lbs to 20lbs. The structure and exercise list further support this by listing exercises that typically involve dumbbells, such as 'Arnold Press', 'Romanian Deadlift', 'Wide Row', and 'Tricep Kickbacks'. The consistent mention of dumbbells throughout all metadata confirms a very high confidence level (1.0) that dumbbells are needed for this workout."
