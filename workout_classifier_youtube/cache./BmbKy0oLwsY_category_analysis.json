  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Stretching' with very high confidence (score 1.0). The title explicitly states that it is a 'Beginner Full Body Stretching Routine,' which is reinforced in the description stating 'Jordan provides an easy-to-follow, head-to-toe, full-body stretching routine.' User comments further emphasize the stretching focus, with one comment appreciating the 'full body stretching' and another highlighting its importance similar to cardio. Additionally, the description mentions using a yoga mat for comfort, typical in stretching routines. The video is part of a series focused on workouts with Jordan, but the tags like 'physical exercise' and 'physical fitness' indicate a general fitness orientation without implying a different primary category. Therefore, no other categories closely apply to this workout."
