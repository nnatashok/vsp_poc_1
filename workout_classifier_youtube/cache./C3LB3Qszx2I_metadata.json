  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years.

    "To everyone who struggled with this workout: You don\u2019t have to be out of shape to have a hard time with this. I\u2019m in good shape for alot of things\u2026but this has some things that were very hard for me. Focus on having good posture, don\u2019t give up. It will get easier with practice! And if you aren\u2019t at your physical best, be proud of yourself for trying these moves, they are hard!!!",
    "So happy to have the weekly playlist back, thanks Nicole!",
    "I recommended you to all my close friends, I have been doing your videos 5X a week for the last 3 yrs.Thank you for making me feel great everyday\ud83d\ude0a",
    "I am 74. Been doing various types of yoga (Iyengar, Kundalini, Hatha, Yin) over the last 45 years. All the harder maybe to put up with sagging skin, dwindling muscles and aching knees.<br><br>My granddaughter introduced me to your videos.<br><br>I knew straightaway they were good for me. Guess what: after a 3-week daily practice, even though the change may not show from the outside, I feel an inner swing from the pelvic floor and balance is steadier. I\u2019ll certainly keep going. Merci Nicole!",
    "I can\u2019t believe I forgot how good this feels. I love having control over my body."
