  "vibesExplanation": "The main focus of the video is on box breathing, a calming and stress-reducing technique. The title, '5-Minute Stress Buster,' and the description, emphasize its role in maintaining calm and focus, which aligns closely with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe, earning a high score of 0.9. This vibe is characterized by nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement, fitting perfectly with the nature of box breathing. Additionally, the 'Zen Flow' vibe is applicable, as the exercise is breath-centered and intentional, embodying the grounding and unhurried qualities described for this vibe. While user comments highlight the simplicity and effectiveness of the technique in calming and focusing the mind, further supporting the classification, the absence of more overtly physical movement excludes other vibes like 'The Mindful Walk' or 'The Meditative Grind.' The high view count and engagement suggest the video successfully delivers on its calming promise, reinforcing the chosen vibes with an overall confidence of 0.85."
