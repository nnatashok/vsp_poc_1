  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves a variety of exercises typical of a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) routine. With the description emphasizing a 'full body workout,' the movements will likely include exercises such as burpees, jump squats, and other dynamic, compound exercises. These require some coordination and balance, especially given the 'extreme' nature indicated in the title, suggesting it may challenge even seasoned exercisers. However, as it is no equipment-based, the movements are unlikely to reach an 'Expert' difficulty but may demand more than basic coordination, positioning it between Intermediate and Advanced.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 60-minute duration and the 45 seconds on/15 seconds off intervals are indicators of a high-effort workout. The title's use of 'Extreme HIIT' along with 'Fat Burn & Cardio' keywords implies a high energy expenditure designed to significantly elevate heart rate and push physical limits, suitable for those accustomed to longer, intense sessions. User comments highlight the workout's demanding nature, mentioning outdoor execution 'took a bit more effort' and feelings of accomplishment, aligning with high perceived exertion.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering both the technique and effort difficulty, the required fitness level spans Intermediate to Elite. The extended duration and intensity are likely not suitable for beginners, confirming that a baseline fitness of at least 'Intermediate' is necessary, with 'Advanced' strongly applicable due to the workout's extreme nature and length. The 'Elite' level is also included to account for those who regularly engage in high-intensity, long-duration sessions. User comments echo significant exertion and positive outcomes, suggesting suitability for these fitness levels."
