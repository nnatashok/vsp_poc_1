  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout from 'Roberta's Gym' has distinct elements that fit multiple workout spirits. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is strongly evident (0.7) given the methodical setup of the workout, as indicated by the precise time codes and organized sequence of exercises in the description, which emphasizes routine and progression. The exercise list and the emphasis on daily or frequent practice align with disciplined approaches.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is marked at 0.65 because the workout is low-impact and designed specifically to avoid jumping, making it safe for those with joint issues, as highlighted by the title and description. The comments mention its gentle nature, supporting its calming and restorative intent.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is moderately present (0.5) as the workout includes continuous movements that involve coordination, like punches and step jacks, and it is designed to be completed in a single, uninterrupted session, highlighting a rhythmic flow. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' are less relevant given the focus on beginner level and no jumping, which lowers the intensity. The absence of sports-specific or outdoor references excludes 'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits."
