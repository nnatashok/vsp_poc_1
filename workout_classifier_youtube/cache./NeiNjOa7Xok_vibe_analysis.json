  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled '20 Minute Full Body Stretch Routine' on the Well+Good channel aligns primarily with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, scoring 0.9, due to its focus on a relaxing, total-body stretch aimed at loosening tight muscles, ideal for starting a day or ending a workout. The use of terms like 'full body stretch,' 'no equipment needed,' and instructor-led follow-along cues suggest an easeful, rejuvenative session. This classification is reinforced by comments indicating relief and well-being, fitting the deep stretch, low stress component. 'The Comfort Moves' vibe, scoring 0.7, is applicable here as well, given its accessibility (evidenced by a user with health conditions still participating) and gentle nature. Lastly, 'The Zen Flow' vibe is moderately relevant, scoring 0.6, as the routine encourages a breath-centered, intentional approach to stretching, according to the core Pilates-influenced methodology described, without a fast pace or complex movement pattern, aligning with a grounding, calm routine."
