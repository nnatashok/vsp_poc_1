  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the video is 'Soothing & Restorative,' supported by multiple explicit indicators in the video metadata. The title emphasizes relaxation ('Relax or Fall Asleep Fast'), which aligns strongly with a restorative focus. The description further supports this with phrases like 'calming Breathing Exercise,' 'help calm a busy mind,' and 'reduce anxiety and fall asleep.' The tags 'stress relief,' 'relieve anxiety,' and 'calm breathing' reinforce the restorative nature. User comments highlight the exercise's effectiveness in reducing stress and aiding sleep, typical outcomes of soothing and restorative practices. The high score of 0.95 reflects how closely the video embodies the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The absence of indicators for high intensity, structure, or outdoor elements makes other spirits less applicable."
