  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is focused on a \"10 Minute Morning Breathwork Routine\", which is primarily a guided breathing exercise meant to alleviate anxiety and promote calmness. The metadata, including the title, description, tags, and comments, emphasizes mental clarity, anxiety relief, and personal growth through breathwork rather than physical exercise requiring equipment. Commonly associated tags with equipment like 'yoga' or 'meditation' do not explicitly point to the need for a mat or other yoga-related equipment, and no mention of equipment is found in the description or commentary. The emphasis is on using breath alone, suggesting that the routine can be performed in any comfortable position without the need for additional supports or props. Thus, the workout is determined to be bodyweight only, requiring no equipment to perform."
