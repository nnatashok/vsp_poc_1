  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Meditation', assigned with a confidence score of 1. This decision is based on the explicit mention in the title ('5 Minute Stress Relief Guided Meditation') and recurrent references throughout the metadata including tags like 'guided meditation', 'meditate', 'guided visualisation', and 'relaxation meditation'. These strongly indicate a meditation-focused video. The description supports this by emphasizing relaxation and regaining control over stress, which aligns with meditation practices. Comments further attest to its calming and mindfulness qualities, typical of meditation sessions. Additionally, 'Breathing exercises' is a relevant secondary category with a score of 0.6, given the repeated mention of calming and focus, suggesting controlled breathing is a likely component of the guided meditation process. The use of calming music and references to breathing along with 'waves' in user comments also infer a breathing element. Other categories, like 'Yoga' or 'Stretching', are not applicable as they lack presence in the metadata and descriptions."
