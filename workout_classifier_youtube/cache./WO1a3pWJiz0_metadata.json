This simple, effective core workout routine will strengthen key muscles in your core to stabilize your back and decrease pain. Increase core strength in your abs, obliques, back, and hips to eliminate pain and feel better fast!\n\n======================================\nLINK TO JARED\u2019S THICK EXERCISE MAT: https://urlgeni.us/amzn/drjaredexercisemat\n======================================\n\nWHY DOES YOUR LOWER BACK HURT?\nOne of the main causes of lower back pain is weakness in your core.\n\nYour lumbar vertebrae (your lower back bones) should be a very stable column when it is supported correctly by your core muscles.\n\nWhen these muscles are weak the column becomes lax and unstable which often results in lower back pain.\n\nWHY IS CORE STRENGTH IMPORTANT?\nIf you can strengthen the right core muscles with the right exercises, it will improve the stability in your lower back. This will allow you to perform more activities (like sitting, standing, walking and moving) without pain. \n\nBasically having adequate core strength can alleviate (and even eliminate) lower back pain! That\u2019s exactly what I want to share with you in this video!\n\nBEST CORE EXERCISES FOR LOWER BACK PAIN\nAs a physical therapist, these are the exercises I regularly give to patients to strengthen their core and hips, improve stability in their lower back, and eliminate pain.\n\nIt only takes 10 minutes to perform and trains every major muscle that influences the lower back. This is a complete core strengthening routine and I hope you get some great benefit from performing it regularly.\n\n10-MINUTE CORE WORKOUT ROUTINE FOR LOWER BACK PAIN\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:24 10-Minute Workout Routine\n10:37 Don't Miss This!\n\nSingle Leg Bridge (Left)\nSingle Leg Bridge (Right)\nSide Plank Hip Lift (Left)\nSide Plank Hip Lift (Right)\nBird Dog\nPlank\nUpper Circle Crunch\nReverse Crunch\nTable Top Toe Tap\nSwimmer\nDon't Miss This\n\n\ud83d\udcac Did you try the back pain routine in this video?

    "I am 28 with degenerative disc disease, arthritis in my back, a herniated disc, and a pinched sciatic nerve. I was bedridden and in the ER five days ago, and now I\u2019m up moving and doing mostly normal activities. The only reason I\u2019m up is because I\u2019ve been doing these stretches and exercises multiple times a day. This video has been a lifesaver.",
    "I almost died of lower back pain last week. These exercises are helping me tremendously. I\u2019m truly amazed how something so simple can help crippling pain.",
    "I have avoided core exercises for years, primarily because they would hurt my lower back. However I&#39;ve been doing this one for a few weeks now and no lower back pain and I feel that my core is getting stronger. Great job, thank you for putting this together",
    "48 years old. Generally healthy, never had back problems, and then had my back \u201cgo out\u201d with such pain/spasm that I could barely walk for a week. After the pain subsided, the weakness felt constant. Doc recommended core strengthening exercises and this easy-to-follow video has been wonderful. Doing daily for 2 weeks and feeling stronger/less weak. Thanks!"
