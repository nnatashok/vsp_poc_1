  "spiritsExplanation": "The video title, description and tags emphasize '15 Min CALISTHENICS' and 'bodyweight strength,' suggesting a focus on structure and technical discipline typical of calisthenics, thus earning a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.7. Evidence of this includes the mention of 'no equipment,' 'strength routine,' and 'best bodyweight Calisthenics exercises,' indicating an organized method to gain muscle and strength without gym tools. \n\nAdditionally, phrases such as 'build muscle and strength' and a comment stating the workout caused a 'sweat,' suggest an energetic and somewhat intense nature which supports a minor 'High-Energy & Intense' classification with a score of 0.4, although the primary emphasis remains on structured training. The channel's emphasis on accessible home workouts and the incorporation of beginner to advanced variations suggest a controlled environment rather than an extreme intensity. \n\nOther spirits were excluded due to a lack of focus on rhythmic flow, soothing recovery, sports-specific agility, or outdoor elements in the metadata."
