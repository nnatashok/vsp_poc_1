  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata suggests that dumbbells and resistance bands are required for the PCOS Home Workout video. The user comments explicitly mentioned 'dumbbell flys,' indicating that dumbbells are used for this exercise, which justifies a very high confidence score (0.8) for dumbbells. Additionally, the description includes a link to purchase a 'Set of Resistance Cables,' implying their use in the workout, warranting a high confidence score (0.6) for resistance bands. The presence of these specific exercises in the video implies that resistance bands and dumbbells are necessary for full participation."
