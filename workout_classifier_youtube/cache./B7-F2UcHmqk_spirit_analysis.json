  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.8. This is evidenced by the 60-minute duration specified in the title, the emphasis on a full-body workout with strength training, specific audio cues for form, and modifications provided for exercises, all of which suggest a methodical, planned approach typical of structured training protocols. The inclusion of both beginner and advanced variations mentioned in the description and comments further supports this classification.\n\nThe secondary spirit, 'High-Energy & Intense,' is scored at 0.6 due to the focus on strength and conditioning, which implies a challenging workout designed to improve fitness and strength levels. The comments from users about feeling energized and noticing improvements in strength and body composition further suggest an intensive workout.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded due to the lack of emphasis on smooth, rhythmic movement, relaxation, or recovery aspects in the metadata."
