  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily categorized under 'Indoor biking' with a strong score of 0.9 due to the explicit references to 'indoor cycle training,' 'turbo trainer,' and 'static bike.' The channel name 'Global Cycling Network' further supports the focus on biking. Moreover, comments from viewers refer to the video as one of the best spinning classes, indicating the primary nature of the workout.\n\nThe secondary category is 'HIIT' with a score of 0.65, as the tags include 'high intensity training' and 'hiit,' and the description mentions improving 'sprinting ability,' which implies interval style training. However, since the main focus is on cycling, HIIT is considered a secondary element of the workout.\n\nConsidering the entire video context, other categories like 'Mat,' 'Running,' or 'Weight workout' were not considered due to the lack of relevant indicators."
