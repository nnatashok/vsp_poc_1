  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category of 'Meditation' was selected with a score of 1.0 due to clear and explicit indicators throughout the video metadata. The title '10-Minute Meditation For Anxiety' explicitly identifies the session as meditation-focused. Additionally, tags such as 'guided meditation,' 'anxiety meditation,' and 'meditation for anxiety' underscore the meditation theme. The description references a 'guided meditation' and highlights the involvement of John Davisi, a mindfulness life coach, reinforcing the meditative nature. Comments from viewers reflect experiences typical of meditation, such as feelings of calm and emotional management.\n\nThe secondary category of 'Breathing exercises' was considered with a lower score of 0.4. While not explicitly mentioned, meditation sessions often include breathing exercises as a part of mindfulness practice. The guided aspect and the focus on relieving anxiety suggest an implicit presence of breathing techniques to enhance relaxation. However, due to the lack of explicit reference to breathing practices, the confidence for this category is moderate. Other categories are excluded as the metadata clearly establishes a meditation focus without elements of physical exercise or other workout modalities."
