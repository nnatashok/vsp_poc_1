  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is \"Calisthenics,\" as indicated by the repeated references in the title, description, and tags, such as \"calisthenics workout,\" \"calisthenics glutes workout,\" and \"calisthenics program.\" The description also emphasizes the extensive use of bodyweight exercises, further supporting this classification. The score of 0.9 reflects very high confidence due to explicit mention and focus on calisthenics techniques that target specific muscle groups, such as glutes and hamstrings.\n\nThe secondary category is \"Body weight,\" scoring 0.75. This is primarily because the workout focuses on exercises like hip thrusts and sumo squats performed using one's body weight, without additional equipment, except optional ankle weights. The frequent mention of \"bodyweight workout,\" \"no equipment workout,\" and specific exercises that utilize body weight to target muscle groups justifies this score.\n\nOther categories such as \"Weight workout\" or \"Mat\" are excluded due to the lack of free weights or equipment emphasis (beyond optional ankle weights), and the workout's focus on glute isolation rather than general floor exercises."
