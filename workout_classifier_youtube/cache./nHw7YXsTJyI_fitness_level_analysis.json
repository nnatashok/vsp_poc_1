  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as using low impact and high intensity exercises, typical of standing Pilates and cardio movements, which generally require basic coordination and balance similar to dance routines. The workout is likely to include simple movements accessible to beginners, but the dance-inspired element may add some slight complexity, making it suitable for intermediates as well.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a 35-minute, low-impact, high-intensity standing workout, which would generally result in moderate effort expenditure for most. The inclusion of cardio and ab focus suggests a moderately challenging session. For users not accustomed to continuous activity of this kind, it may feel quite challenging, particularly given its 'high intensity' descriptor.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the moderate technique complexity and effort required, the workout is accessible to beginners, especially since modifications are likely implied by 'low impact' cues. Intermediate users benefit from the dance-inspired cardio and ab work, while advanced users might find a moderately challenging intensity if they maximize the effort. The length of the workout slightly favors more experienced exercisers, but the content remains inclusive of multiple fitness levels."
