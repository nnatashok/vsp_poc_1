    "I started out being the weakling of my class, now I&#39;m one of the strongest kids thanks to this workout! I&#39;m also a girl, so being able to win in arm wrestling against the boys in my class feels like I&#39;ve got some sorta superpower lol",
    "I love the fact that you guys use a sound to signify when you&#39;re switching sides during an exercise. You understand that we&#39;re not always looking at the screen. This is going to be my new go to workout for a while! Got my heart rate really up there and I feel like I really got a great workout in about 20 mins. AMAZING!!!",
    "I really like the \u201cno repeat\u201d routines and the warm up/cool downs!",
    "Thank you guys very much. I was in a motorcycle accident in 2018. Traumatic brain injury, lacerated my liver, fractured 3 ribs sternum and pelvis, broke my left collar bone, back, left  arm, right knee and leg and shattered both of my heels. Every one of those parts was repaired with perminant screws and rods. Suffered for years until my leg was amputated in April 2022. Wish I could post a Pic of the bag of titanium parts they gave me just from my knee down. Time for me to find myself. Hard to do when you cant stand in front of the mirror and not hate what your looking at or feel embarrassed in front of your wife after a shower and you have to take your leg off. So when I previously said thank you, I hope the phrase comes with a lot more meaning. Keep killing it guys. Imagine the help your putting out there. \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude05"
