  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout primarily involves spinning on a stationary bike, which does not require complex movement patterns, reducing the overall technique difficulty. The movements involved in cycling are generally repetitive and involve basic coordination. The use of 'beginner' in some tags (e.g., 'spin class for beginners') suggests the workout is accessible to those at a beginner level. However, the term 'intense tabata' implies there might be some variations or changes in pace requiring a slightly higher degree of control and coordination, which justifies a partial consideration of the intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This 5-minute Tabata workout consists of intense intervals (8 x 20s on, 10s off) characteristic of the Tabata protocol. The words 'intense' and 'finisher' suggest a high effort level within a short duration, which is typical of high-intensity interval training. Despite the short overall workout time, the high-intensity intervals with minimal rest qualify it as 'Challenging' for many users, especially those with lower fitness levels.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The internal structure of the workout, specifically the Tabata format, paired with its short duration, involves very high intensity that generally demands a higher fitness level, aligning with Intermediate and Advanced categories. However, the phrases 'spin class for beginners' and the general accessibility of cycling allow for inclusion of the Beginner level for those who may take it easier or use it as an introduction to high-intensity workouts. Due to its intensity, most deconditioned users would find it more fitting within Intermediate to Advanced scopes, with more fitness levels included as users can modulate effort by adjusting resistance and speed."
