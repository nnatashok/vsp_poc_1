    "Thank you so much... I&#39;m a 17 year old guy that goes to a school full of caring people but I still cannot help but feel judged all the time... I&#39;ve been really suffering and my mind has been on full throttle for too long, I always feel like everything is too much for me. I use youtube as a remedy. I watch my favorite youtubers and they make me laugh and smile more than I do with my friends in real life. No matter who i&#39;m with, i feel so... different, I feel so boring and it has destroyed my confidence in any thing I do. My family can&#39;t afford to get me a therapist or anything of the sort. These videos, though i just found them today, have helped me so much already. Thank you from the bottom, sides, middle, and top of my heart.",
    "the balloons are a really good method to distance yourself from your thoughts. I found it really helpful!",
    "I started reading the comments (which is usually a mistake on youtube videos) and just wanted to point out what lovely humans the people who have commented are :)",
    "\u201c they don\u2019t control you, you have control over them\u201d that\u2019s the source of my hope",
    "These videos are helping me over come my addiction to alcohol. Any time I get a craving I listen to one of these and by the time it&#39;s over the craving is gone and I am calm and relaxed. This is so helpful! Thank you!"
