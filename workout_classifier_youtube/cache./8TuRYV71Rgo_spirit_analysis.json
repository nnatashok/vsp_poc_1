  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout video is 'Soothing & Restorative,' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is supported by the video's focus on stress and anxiety relief, as described in both the video title and the description, which highlights 'gentle 10 minute yoga for stress and anxiety relief' and the calming, restorative nature of the session. The emphasis on hip-focused stretches and breathing techniques, such as the supine twist pose for optimal oxygen intake, aligns with a restorative practice intended for relaxation and emotional release, as noted by many viewer comments describing significant stress relief and emotional comfort. The secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a moderate confidence score of 0.5. This is suggested by the continuous yoga sequence that promotes mind-body connection, rhythmical movement, and a routine suitable for bedtime, indicative of elements where flow and coordination are appreciated. Other spirits are excluded due to the lack of high-energy, structured protocols, sport-specific training, or outdoor/adventurous elements in the metadata."
