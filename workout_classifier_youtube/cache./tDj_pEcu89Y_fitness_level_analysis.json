  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a guided meditation, which consists primarily of affirmations and visualization practices as stated in the description. These elements require minimal physical movement and no complex bodily coordination or advanced technique, making it suitable for the 'Beginner' level in terms of technique difficulty. The instruction to not use while driving or operating machinery suggests safety concerns typical with meditative states, not technique complexity, reinforcing the low difficulty judgment.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "As a guided meditation focusing on visualizations and affirmations, there is no physical exertion involved, implying very low energy expenditure. The disclaimer about not using it while operating machinery indicates mental involvement, not physical effort. Given the absence of physical activity, it's classified as 'Light' effort difficulty. The duration of 32 minutes primarily involves sitting or lying still, requiring minimal physical effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.95,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique difficulty is 'Beginner' due to the nature of guided meditation, which involves no physical movement complexity. The effort is also 'Light', as meditation imposes no physical effort but requires mental relaxation and focus. Therefore, the required fitness level is confidently rated as 'Beginner' since neither the physical nor the technique demands exceed basic sitting or lying down capabilities. Despite the video's length, the lack of physical activity maintains accessibility for complete beginners."
