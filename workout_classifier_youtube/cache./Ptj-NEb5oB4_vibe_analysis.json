  "vibesExplanation": "The video '5 Minute Morning Stretches - Quick Routine for Stretching and Energy' by Jessica Valant predominantly fits 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The emphasis on 'morning stretches' and a 'quick routine for stretching and energy' implies a grounding, intentional approach, aligning with 'The Zen Flow' (score 0.75). The mention of stretching tight muscles and improving energy supports this as a calming and centering morning practice. \n\nAdditionally, the workout suggests elements of 'The Reboot Workout' (score 0.65), as it provides a 'quick stretch' to 'feel grounded' and offers a 'total-body refresh' that aims to prepare for the day. Comments supporting the sequence's flow and energizing nature, as well as tags like 'morning yoga' and 'Pilates for energy,' also back this vibe. \n\nLastly, there is a slight resemblance to 'The Endorphin Wave' (score 0.45), since participants report feeling energized post routine, but the workout's short and gentle nature limits its intensity to fully match this vibe."
