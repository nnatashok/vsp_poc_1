  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title, description, tags, and comments all indicate that this is a yoga workout focused on strength and flexibility. Moreover, the description explicitly states 'No equipment' is required. The tags include 'no equipment', 'bodyweight workout', and 'at home workout', further emphasizing the absence of necessary equipment. Yoga typically requires minimal or no equipment, and the primary focus here is on mobility and flexibility, not using props. Although yoga sometimes involves mats, blocks, or straps, there is no indication in the metadata that these are needed for this workout. Therefore, the workout appears to be entirely bodyweight-based, requiring no additional equipment."
