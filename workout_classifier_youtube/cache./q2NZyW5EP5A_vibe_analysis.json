  "vibesExplanation": "The assigned vibes are based on the workout's structure and user experience indicators found in the metadata. The primary vibe, 'The Endorphin Wave' (score: 0.7), was chosen because the workout is designed for beginners to elevate heart rate and improve metabolism through steady cardio movements. The 5-minute duration of the workout promotes a quick yet satisfying engagement, consistent with the feel-good, continuous movement vibe of 'The Endorphin Wave'. The use of HIIT techniques and visible enjoyment in comments like users struggling but feeling accomplished supports this classification.\n\n'\"The Meditative Grind\" (score: 0.6) fits as a secondary vibe due to the repetitive nature of the exercise sequence (jogs, jumps, and knee lifts) and the interval training's methodical pace, which can lead to a zoned-in state. Despite its intensity (HIIT), the workout's beginner-friendly aspect indicates a somewhat meditative, controlled experience as participants focus on sustaining effort across intervals.\n\nHigh scores are not given for vibes like 'The Firestarter' or 'The Warrior Workout,' as the workout lacks extreme intensity and primal energy, focusing instead on a beginner-friendly approach."
