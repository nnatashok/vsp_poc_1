    "If you happen to read this, know that you are capable of creating your own happiness. Embrace your true self and focus on positivity. Spread love and kindness, and watch as the universe brings more of it back to you. You got this!\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b",
    "Thank you! I&#39;m from Ukraine and I started to follow your meditations when the war came into my life. It really helped me to find sense again and to feel alive, and it still helps. Thank you for your job and your support \u2764 \u0414\u044f\u043a\u0443\u044e",
    "This meditation is just wonderful. Especially when Juliana said &quot;I love you&quot; at the end, I was very overwhelmed. \ud83d\udc9c",
    "As someone who wasn\u2019t nurtured at all as a child and dealt with a lot of abuse. These past few months I have finally started working on loving myself and nurturing myself, being kind to myself. I broke down, this meditation was so beautiful. Thank you for this. Wishing everyone luck on their personal journeys \u2764",
    "Thank you so much for this meditation. Tears started rolling as I pronounced the words \u201cThrough love, I return home to my heart\u2026\u201d in the mantra. I am not a perfect human being. I have caused hurt to others as I was hurt in the inside. Now realizing that my pain inside is only the Universe letting me know that I deserve love. Thank you for this beautiful reminder."
