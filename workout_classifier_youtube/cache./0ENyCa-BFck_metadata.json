    "As a new calisthenics member who just unlocked his first pull up, ever just a few days, i highly appreciate this video.",
    "Tomorrow marks one year since I started calisthenics, and I&#39;ve only missed one day all year. It&#39;s changed me so much, both mentally and physically. I&#39;ve gone from 65 kg to 78 kg. I was born with a rare heart condition that caused chest pains and shortness of breath. Doctors advised me to avoid calisthenics because it was considered risky\u2014but I didn\u2019t listen. Ever since I started, I\u2019ve had zero symptoms.<br><br>Start now\u2014you won\u2019t regret it! For me, the first two months were the hardest. Also,<br> this channel has taught me everything. THANKS Daniel",
    "Oooh, amazing. Back to the roots of your channel, I see!",
    "thanks mate you&#39;ve helped me a lot, i haven&#39;t managed to look like you  but at 62 im looking and feeling better than  i have for decades.  happy new year"
