  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is primarily classified as 'The Zen Flow' due to its focus on mindful, breath-centered stretching routines. Phrases like 'stay flexy' and 'flexibility plan' in the description, as well as the casual setting and encouraging comments from viewers, support this vibe. The 'Reboot Workout' is also relevant due to the emphasis on low-stress, refreshing movements ideal for releasing tension from the body, as highlighted by comments noting improvement in personal well-being and recovery from stiffness. 'The Comfort Moves' is a fitting smaller vibe given the approachable and casual nature of the video, as shown by comments that appreciate its accessibility and the ability to perform it anywhere in the home. Despite these vibes, the intensity and structure are consistent with gentle stretching rather than high-energy or endurance-focused workouts, thus excluding vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Endorphin Wave.' The high viewership and positive feedback from consistent usage also suggest the video's widespread appeal and effectiveness, enhancing confidence in these classifications."
