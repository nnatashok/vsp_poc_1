  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category 'Breathing exercises' was chosen due to explicit references to breathing techniques aimed at calming the nervous system, as mentioned in the video's title and description. The focus on 'Equal Breathing Exercise for Sleep' aligns precisely with controlled breathing practices, justifying a high score of 1. The duration and comments reinforce that this video is used for calming or relaxing purposes, which is central to breathing exercises. The secondary category 'Meditation' was scored at 0.6 due to its meditative nature aimed at preparing the mind for sleep, indicated by comments about the exercise helping users fall asleep and providing mental relief during stressful situations. This context implies an overlapping meditative benefit in addition to breathing, but as the title and description don't explicitly state meditation, it receives a moderate score."
