    "I had brain surgery May 1 2013 after gaining 55 lbs in 3 yrs because I was unable to exercise.<br><br>I purchased a spin bike the same ones you use in some if your videos. I was unable to use it right away as my mom and brother both fell Ill with cancer . My mom passed away and I now have epilepsy as well so am unable to drive. <br><br>I started in my spin bike again close to a month ago . I watch what I eat . I follow your spin classes and have already lost 15 lbs. I am near 47 yrs old .<br><br>Continue to post your spin  classes please they are my motivation",
