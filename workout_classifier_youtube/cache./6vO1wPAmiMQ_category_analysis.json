  "categoriesExplanation": "The video was categorized primarily under \"Meditation\" with a score of 1 because the title explicitly states 'Guided Meditation For Anxiety & Stress' and the tags include numerous entries like 'Meditation (Idea)', 'guided meditation for stress', and 'relaxation meditation'. This aligns perfectly with the description, which promotes meditation content for peace and stress relief. The comments also reflect the impact of meditation on users seeking relaxation and anxiety relief. The channel is dedicated to meditation and relaxation, further reinforcing this categorization. \n\nAdditionally, \"Breathing exercises\" was given a secondary score of 0.7 due to the mention of guided mediation, which often includes breathing techniques to aid in relaxation and stress reduction. However, this is an implicit inference as the information does not explicitly detail specific breathing exercises. Furthermore, channel information and tags do not emphasize breathing exercises as separate components, which diminishes its score."
