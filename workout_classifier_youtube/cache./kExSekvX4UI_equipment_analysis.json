  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video content focuses on stretches for spasticity targeted at individuals with Multiple Sclerosis. It mentions two specific exercises: \"Hip Cross Over\" and \"Hip Rotation,\" which are typical bodyweight stretches. The title, description, and tags do not indicate any specific fitness equipment being required. Although the duration of user comments suggests that these are simple, effective stretches, there is no discussion in the comments about needing particular equipment, such as mats or props. The emphasis on stretches, especially in the context of accessibility for individuals with mobility limitations, further supports that no additional equipment is necessary. Thus, with high confidence, this workout appears to be bodyweight-only, requiring no equipment."
