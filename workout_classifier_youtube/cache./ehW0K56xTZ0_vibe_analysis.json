  "vibesExplanation": "The workout predominantly fits 'The Meditative Grind' due to the structured, repetitive nature of interval training described in the workout, specifically through fast walking or jogging intervals, which can induce a meditative focus on rhythm and pacing. This is supported by comments highlighting its challenge and rewarding persistence, suggesting a rhythmic, engaged experience (score: 0.6). 'The Endorphin Wave' is also applicable as the workout promises positive changes, improved health, and a steady challenge to one's capabilities, suggesting feel-good movement and a steady energy build-up (score: 0.5). Lastly, 'The Groove Session' is considered as the workout is rhythm-based and music-infused, as implied in comments showing enjoyment and expressive movement with interval variations (score: 0.4). The workout is less aligned with vibes focused on high intensity or adventure, given its low-impact and customizable nature for beginner to intermediate levels."
