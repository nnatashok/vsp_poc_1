  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is described as an 'all-purpose all levels natural and functional movement and yoga routine,' indicating simplicity suitable for those new to yoga. Yoga generally requires some coordination, especially in sequences like vinyasa or power yoga. Tags like 'vinyasa flow' and 'functional flow' suggest slightly complex patterns but not highly technical movements. These indicators suggest a range from beginner to intermediate technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is short, only 11.5 minutes long, indicating lower energy expenditure which suggests a 'Light' effort level. The tags include 'power yoga' and 'full body yoga,' which might imply a moderate effort level for beginners. Given the routine's duration and yoga style, effort difficulty leans more towards 'Light,' with some potential 'Moderate' effort due to the intensity of movements in power yoga and functional flow.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the technique and effort difficulty, the required fitness level is mainly 'Beginner,' as indicated by the 'all-levels' descriptor in the video description. The routine's short duration makes it suitable for beginners, but inclusion of intermediate flow styles suggests that even those with some yoga experience can benefit. Technique difficulty supports beginner to intermediate levels, given the coordination needed in vinyasa or power yoga flows. This matches the target audience who can easily modify intensity and complexity."
