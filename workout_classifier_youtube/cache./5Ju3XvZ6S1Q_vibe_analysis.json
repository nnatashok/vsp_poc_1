  "vibesExplanation": "The choice of vibes primarily stems from the video's focus on deep relaxation and full-body stretching. The video is clearly designed to be a calming and restorative experience, which closely aligns with 'The Zen Flow.' It emphasizes intentional, breath-centered movement with a focus on releasing tension and promoting relaxation, as evident from both the description and viewer comments noting the emotional connection and peacefulness. This is consistent with 'The Zen Flow' and is assigned a high score of 0.9 due to the strong descriptors like 'deep relaxation,' 'yin inspired,' and 'bedtime routine.'\n\nThe 'Reboot Workout' vibe is a strong fit with a score of 0.8, as the emphasis on stretching and low stress aligns with this vibe's characteristics. The video seems to offer a total-body refresh, with increased flexibility over time, making it suitable as a 'reboot.'\n\nFinally, with a score of 0.7, 'The Deep Recharge' is recognized due to the instructive mention of meditation and promoting a feeling of refreshment reminiscent of a nervous system reset. The comments also reflect an experience of profound relaxation and emotional release, which underscores this classification. Other vibes such as 'The Comfort Moves' and 'The Sleep Prep' were considered but not selected, as the focus here is more on gentle stretching and relaxation rather than movement safety or sleep preparation specifically."
