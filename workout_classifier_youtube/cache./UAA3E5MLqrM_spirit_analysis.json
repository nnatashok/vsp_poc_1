  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as \"Soothing & Restorative\" with high confidence due to its focus on relaxation and stress relief. The title and description emphasize \"Relief from Stress & Anxiety,\" \"Relaxing Stretch,\" and \"Gentle Stretching,\" all indicating a restorative spirit. Comments from viewers also suggest the session is widely appreciated for its calming and accessible seated format, enhancing its restorative nature. The score of 0.9 signifies an extremely strong match with this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the workout is moderately matched with the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit, receiving a score of 0.5. The description mentions a \"gentle warm-up\" and the routine is \"performed in real time,\" which implies a continuous flow and easy follow-along pattern. However, the primary focus on relaxation rather than coordination or music-driven pace limits the degree of this match.\n\nOther spirits, like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Sport & Agility,\" are excluded due to the lack of intensity and sports-specific elements in the metadata."
