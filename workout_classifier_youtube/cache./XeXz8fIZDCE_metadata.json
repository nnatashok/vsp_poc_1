    "Adriene I was in great low back pain. My lower back hurt when I sat, laid down, or walked. I was seriously thinking I may need surgery. A friend of my suggested yoga, I found your video on lower back pain. After 4 days of repeating this video I felt like a different person. I now practice with this video twice a week. This old man who thought the practice of yoga was a bunch of nonsense is now a believer. Thank you for saving me.",
    "I&#39;ve created a YouTube account just to leave this message. <br>In July 2019 i was climbing  a loft ladder that turned out wasn&#39;t fixed properly, it broke from under me and I fell about 8 feet straight onto my back, fracturing my spine. <br>I&#39;ve come across your videos and I cannot begin to put into words what they&#39;ve done for me. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll ever read this but I feel like I needed you to know what a huge positive impact  you&#39;ve had on my every day life. I trawled through yoga videos, and always found them to be very impersonal and stand offish. When I stumbled across yours I felt so relieved and relaxed, like i was doing yoga with an old friend. My pain is better every day and often i can feel it working literally as I&#39;m doing it. No other youtuber has had that impact on me. It&#39;s become my new lockdown routine to have Adriene in the morning and before bed. Your humour and wit has me laughing during the poses sometimes! Thank you from the bottom of my heart for changing and improving my world. X",
    "Such a small thing to be proud of myself for, but when you said \u201conce you feel satisfied\u201d I realized I was NOT satisfied, paused the video, and did the whole cycle a couple more times. I have struggled for a long time to feel connected with my body, and I\u2019m a little proud of myself for listening to it, even in this one little way.",
    "I love this digital age where Adrian did this once (or however, long it took) 10 years ago and the effect is still ripping through healing power across the world today."
