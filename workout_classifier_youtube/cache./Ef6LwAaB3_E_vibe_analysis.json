  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Reboot Workout' as indicated by the video's purpose of providing a deep stretch and total-body refresh. The description emphasizes its use as a quick cool down, or even to start or end your day, highlighting its suitability for 'low stress' and 'total-body refresh' which aligns with the Reboot Workout vibe. The high number of views and likes suggests a well-loved routine that provides a gentle refresh, deserving of a score of 0.9 for this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Zen Flow' vibe is relevant given the calming nature of stretching and its mention as a morning or pre-bed routine. The comments also denote a sense of satisfaction and relaxation, with one user mentioning how their body felt amazing and motivated after the stretch. This justifies a score of 0.75. The video is not quite a full 'Zen Flow' due to its brevity (5-minute duration) which is shorter than most meditative practices, thus not achieving an unhurried pace, hence the moderate score.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Comfort Moves' or 'The Deep Recharge' were considered but not selected due to the interactive and slightly dynamic nature of the stretches, which target effectiveness over comfort or complete relaxation."
