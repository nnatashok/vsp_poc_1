  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as 'Mat' because it features a prenatal cardio workout that is performed without equipment, which suggests exercises conducted on the floor or a mat. The title explicitly mentions 'No Equipment,' and the description reaffirms this, indicating the workout is done at home. The tags also support this classification, emphasizing 'prenatal cardio' and 'pregnancy safe.' There are no mentions or indications of machines such as treadmills or bikes, which confirms the absence of those specific workout methods. The focus is on cardio exercises suitable for pregnant women, conducted at home without additional equipment, commonly aligned with mat-based workout styles. Given the clear information on the exercise style, duration, and equipment necessary, confidence in this classification is high."
