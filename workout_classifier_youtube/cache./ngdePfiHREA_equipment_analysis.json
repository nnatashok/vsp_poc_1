  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a stretching workout, typically performed on the floor. While the title and description focus on flexibility and stretching exercises for beginners and intermediates, there is no explicit mention of a mat. However, the nature of stretching routines, especially those performed on the floor, strongly implies that a mat would be beneficial for comfort and support. This is further supported by the tags like 'full body stretch' and 'stretching after workout', which often involve exercises that are done lying down or seated. Therefore, the confidence level for a mat is high at 0.7 as it's strongly implied but not explicitly mentioned in the metadata. Other equipment is not mentioned or relevant based on the provided information."
