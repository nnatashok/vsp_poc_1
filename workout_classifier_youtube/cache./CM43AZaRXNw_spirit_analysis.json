  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout video is 'Flow & Rhythm', characterized by the use of terms like 'yoga flow', 'vinyasa', and 'full body yoga flow' in the title, description, and tags. These elements suggest a continuous and synchronized approach to movement, common in vinyasa and flow-based yoga practices. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong alignment of the video's title and content description with this spirit.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Soothing & Restorative'. Although the workout focuses on strength and energy, the practice's inclusion of 'stretchy poses' and user comments, such as references to how the class was 'needed for peace' during chaotic times, indicate a restorative aspect. The video is also designed for morning practice, which often emphasizes gentle awakening, aligning it partially with this spirit. Therefore, this is given a 0.7 score. \n\nOther spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'High-Energy & Intense' are less relevant, as the flow nature of the workout and focus on energy balancing does not fit structured progression or high intensity."
