    "So - how flexible are you?! Where are you the tightest and what do you need the most help with? COMMENT below and let me know if you liked this video and how I can help you in the future! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc (Also - not a bad idea to supplement your stretching with some consistent core strengthening. Here&#39;s a 6-minute core routine I recommend: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJp08smdcFk\">https://youtu.be/pJp08smdcFk</a> )",
    "I&#39;m 23 years old and can&#39;t touch my toes. I am definitely active and my lack of flexibility is a running joke between my friends and I. I don&#39;t want to grow up past the point of no return so thank you for a genuinely beginner-flexibility routine",
    "I finally did it. I am 19 years old and after stretching every day for 3 months straight I have no more neck pain, back cramps and I can reach my toes! To everyone that thinks they can&#39;t do it, just be patient and stay disciplined!<br><br>-Edit: For the people asking how I do it.<br>I do this stretching routine every morning after showering cold, sometimes a second time before bed if I am feeling stiff.<br>I do change it up sometimes and don&#39;t exactly follow the instructions, its good to keep variations, for example:<br>- The hamstring stretch i replaced with a sitting hamstring stretch and using a resistance band to pull myself to my toes.<br>- The neck stretch i replaced with a butterfly stretch.<br>- I added a straddle stretch.<br>- For the shoulders, back and chest, I hang with one arm with my feet on the ground and try to relax myself and get as stretched as possible; its important to have your feet on the ground for a relaxed and controlled stretch.<br><br>I am a calisthenics athlete and stretching is very important, to avoid pain and muscle cramps",
    "83 yo grandma here, generally fit but lazy last couple years+. Getting back into step aerobics, core and stretching. Thank you for this video. Also, I\u2019m very encouraged reading the comments. I plan to stick with your core &amp; stretching routine and advance as my strength and balance improve.",
    "I did this video for the first time like 2 months ago. I was NEVER flexible and my chiropractor insisted I incorporate stretching into my routine. Since doing this every morning I&#39;ve noticed SUCH a huge difference not only in my flexibility, but also just how I feel in general. It&#39;s also made me more interested in improving other stretches and looking into yoga more too! Thank you!"
