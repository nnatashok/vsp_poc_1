  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled '45 MINUTE FAT MELTING HIIT CARDIO WORKOUT(1000 CALORIES)' is strongly indicative of a 'The Warrior Workout' vibe. This is evident from the use of terms like 'HIIT', 'cardio', and 'burn 1000 calories', highlighting a high-intensity, sweat-inducing session. The metadata emphasizes a challenging, primal energy workout for weight loss and calorie burn, supported by comments that reference the workout's intensity and demand (e.g., 'one of the best workouts', 'absolutely knocked me around'). Hence, a score of 0.95 is given for 'The Warrior Workout'.\n\nThe length of the workout (45 minutes) and mentions of 'calories' and 'weight loss' also suggest a sustained, energetic session, which aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe. Comments showing commitment over multiple days and user satisfaction with transformation (e.g., 'lost about 6 kgs', 'best workouts') indicate a sustained effort leading to a sense of accomplishment and positive feelings, justifying a 'The Endorphin Wave' with a score of 0.65. Though other vibes like 'The Firestarter' could be considered due to intensity, they lack the prolonged endurance element seen here."
