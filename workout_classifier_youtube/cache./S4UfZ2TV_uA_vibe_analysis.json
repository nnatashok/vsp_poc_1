  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified mostly as 'The Reboot Workout,' with a strong score of 0.9, thanks to its focus on relieving tension and providing a low-stress experience, as evidenced by terms like 'relieve tension,' 'slow workout,' 'low intensity,' and 'low impact' found in the title, tags, and description. The elements of stretching and absence of equipment further support this classification. The score of 0.9 indicates a very strong alignment with this vibe, owing to explicit indicators of relaxation and refreshment for the body during menstruation. The 'Deep Recharge' vibe also fits, scoring 0.7, as the workout offers a gentle, caring approach focused on tension relief, akin to a nervous system reset. This is supported by user comments like 'relief that hit my body' and 'cramps are gone,' reflecting the calming and restorative intent typical of 'Deep Recharge.' Other vibes such as 'The Zen Flow' or 'Comfort Moves' were considered, but the emphasis on period-specific tension relief aligns more closely with a recharge or reboot rather than simply grounding or comfortable movement."
