  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The routine described in the video appears to involve basic stretching and mobility exercises, which typically do not require complex movements or high coordination. The repeated mention of terms like 'beginner workout', 'beginner stretch', and simplicity in execution suggests the movements are beginner-friendly. However, some exercises might require minimal coordination or body awareness typically found in intermediate routines, especially for tight muscles or higher flexibility needs.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The metadata indicates that this is a 15-minute mobility and stretching routine, which is typically low in energy expenditure and primarily aimed at improving flexibility and relaxation rather than providing a cardiovascular or muscular endurance challenge. The relaxation and recovery focus, indicated by terms like 'calming', 'grounding', and 'recovery workout', suggests a light effort. However, maintaining poses for 50-60 seconds could introduce a moderate effort element for those less accustomed to such routines, warranting a small consideration for moderate effort difficulty.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulties, the workout is highly suitable for beginners, as indicated by the tags and comments mentioning its accessibility and use as an active recovery or relaxing session. The added mention of a 52-year-old just returning to exercise suggests it's very accessible. An intermediate fitness level is included due to the possibility of tight muscles providing a moderate challenge during some stretches over extended holds and for those looking to enhance flexibility further. The overall simplicity and target for flexibility allow this workout to cater well to both beginner and some intermediate practitioners."
