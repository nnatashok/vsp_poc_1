  "categoriesConfidence": 0.9,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category is \"Yoga\" with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is strongly supported by the video's title '5 min Morning Yoga Stretches in Bed', the description specifying 'a quick morning yoga flow', and tags such as 'morning yoga for beginners' and 'yoga in bed.' Additionally, the channel 'Yoga with Kassandra' is dedicated primarily to yoga content, further reinforcing this categorization. \"Stretching\" is selected as a secondary category with a score of 0.7 due to multiple mentions in the tags and description, such as 'morning stretches for beginners' and 'stretching routines for flexibility,' and the focus on waking up and target areas like the neck and shoulders. Other potential categories do not apply, as the video content and style do not align with non-yoga exercises or equipment-based workouts. The strong alignment of the metadata to yoga practice establishes a very high confidence in these categorizations."
