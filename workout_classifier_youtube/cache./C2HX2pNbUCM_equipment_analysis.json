  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title explicitly mentions 'At-Home Pilates (No Equipment)', suggesting no traditional workout equipment is necessary. However, the description contains a promotional link to a mat from Liforme, and since it's a pilates workout, this implies a mat is recommended for comfort and safety during floor exercises, despite not being classified as 'equipment'. The use of the mat is reinforced by the tag 'mat pilates'. This strong suggestion of a mat raises the confidence level to 0.95, indicating it's very likely necessary for performing the workout effectively. Other equipment, such as dumbbells or resistance bands, is unlikely needed since the video emphasizes a no equipment approach."
