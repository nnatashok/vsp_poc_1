    "I&#39;m obese and I&#39;ve just started my weight loss journey. Took me an hour to complete the whole session. But I did it. I&#39;m proud of myself \u263a\ufe0f thank you so much!",
    "This is my go-to workout channel, you guys motivate me more than any other channel has. I don\u2019t need to work out to lose weight but I suffer with depression and just having this makes me want to get after it every day. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",
    "I like that it\u2019s got visual previews, little talking and more music. Perfect workout combo thank you. Def gonna watch more vids",
    "I have had these for several weeks <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxP26Tir6n60vUkdtn4mbwhRO8cwuJQNy2\">https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxP26Tir6n60vUkdtn4mbwhRO8cwuJQNy2</a> and I have been really happy with them so far. I love being able to do a variety of workouts at home when I don&#39;t have time to make it to the gym. When paired with a basic bench, there are tons of different exercises and you can hit pretty much all major muscle groups. It is easy to adjust to your desired weight with the dials on each side. They slide in and out of the cradle smoothly. The only downside to this design vs the newer version, is that these are pretty wide. This does limit your range of motion with certain hand positions on certain exercises. Straight dumbbell press would be an example of this. I have to turn my hands slightly in order to bring them close enough together. Not a huge deal to me though. Really happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend."
