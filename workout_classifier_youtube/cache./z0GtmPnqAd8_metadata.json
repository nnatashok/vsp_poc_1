    "To anybody reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace confusion. may peace and calmness fill your life \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc93",
    "If you are reading comments to decide if you should do this meditation, just hit play. I have listened to thousands... This is by far my favorite \u2764\ufe0f! She is in another realm of consciousness with this one. Your are safe... you are sacred... don&#39;t be afraid...",
    "I\u2019m not sure why, but good meditations make you cry. They release emotions you had stored away out of fear, or feeling like you needed to protect yourself. But you are safe, it is true. And you are loved. Sitting and remembering that you are your own sacred being, capable of producing beauty and wonder and kindness is such a healing thing.<br><br>I needed this, I\u2019m feeling lost right now, and I know the only person who can truly help me is myself. I may be scared, but i won\u2019t let it guide me. This meditation helped me to let my inner fire burn brighter, and envision myself a warrior. Thank you.",
    "&quot;everything I need is within me&quot; thank you ever so much! \ud83d\ude4f"
