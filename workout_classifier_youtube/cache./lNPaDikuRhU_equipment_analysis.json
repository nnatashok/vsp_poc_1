  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"15 Minute Gentle Full Body Stretch\" does not explicitly mention any equipment requirements in the title, description, or tags. The focus is on gentle stretch routines typically associated with Pilates, which suggests bodyweight-only exercises. The description indicates that the routine targets flexibility and relaxation, which usually involves basic stretches that do not necessitate equipment. Though 'gentle Pilates workout' is mentioned in the tags, and Pilates can sometimes use mats, the metadata lacks any direct reference to a mat or any other equipment. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude with high confidence that this video is designed to be completed without any specific equipment, relying solely on bodyweight exercises to achieve its stretch and relaxation goals."
