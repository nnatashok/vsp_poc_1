  "vibesExplanation": "The workout, titled \"Morning Energy Yoga | 20 Minutes | All levels,\" strongly resonates with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, scoring 0.7. The description highlights a \"flow through a sequence of postures,\" focusing on breath-centered practices that are unhurried, grounding, and aim to increase mental clarity and overall vitality. Keywords like \"energizing yoga practice,\" \"awaken your muscles,\" and \"stimulate your energy centers\" suggest this relaxing yet invigorating flow, making 'The Zen Flow' highly appropriate. \n\nThe secondary vibe, 'The Reboot Workout,' scores 0.6 as the practice serves as a \"substitute for your coffee or tea,\" and promises to \"leave you feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day.\" This aligns with the concept of a total-body refresh seen in 'The Reboot Workout.' \n\nNo high-intensity indicators are present, ruling out vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter.' The instructional approach and integration of self-care and modification for all levels exclude 'The Disciplined Grind' and make these chosen vibes fitting with moderate to high confidence."
