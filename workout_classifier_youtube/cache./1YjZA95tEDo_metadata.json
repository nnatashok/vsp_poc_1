  "description": "Enjoy the deepest relaxation and increase lung capacity with this 20 minute version of the 4-7-8 breathing technique. The breaths gradually slow and extend to an ideal calming pace.\n\n4-7-8 rhythmic breathing is a core part of many meditation and yoga practices as it promotes relaxation and can also be used to help you fall asleep in a shorter period of time. The goal is to calm your sympathetic nervous system, which controls the fight-or-flight response. \n\nNOTE: In this video, the 4-7-8 counting does not follow seconds (the pace is purposefully slower). There are other versions of the 4-7-8 exercise on this channel that have a faster breathing pace and versions that have a slower breathing pace. You should try them all to learn what works best for you.\n\nIf you tend to be a shallow breather, it\u2019s common to feel a little lightheaded when you start taking deeper breaths. This sensation will pass as your body becomes accustomed to a greater flow of oxygen. You can always take a short break and resume the exercise once you feel normal. It is not necessary that your timing perfectly matches the video example. You can take shorter or longer breaths as long as you maintain the ratio - Inhale 4, Hold 7, Exhale 8. Also, try to keep your expectations realistic. Some days will be easier than others, but the more often you practice, the more effective the exercise becomes.\n\n\n\n//  STRUGGLING TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH?\n\nIf you are having difficulty taking a deep enough breath to complete the 4-7-8 exercise, you may wish to begin with a simple video that teaches proper abdominal breathing.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ApAsKd4hYiw\n\n\n\n//  GUIDED HANDS-ON MEDITATIONS\n\nIf you would like to try meditation, I encourage you to try the Hands-On Meditation technique. It's easier than traditional meditation.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzK1U3HzIGbgtuKVCRmXgOV8U1RzC_xcC\n\n\n\n// SOCIAL\n\n\u2022 Instagram https://www.instagram.com/HandsOnMeditation\n\n\u2022 Pinterest https://www.pinterest.com/HandsOnMeditate\n\n\u2022 Twitter https://twitter.com/HandsOnMeditate\n\n\u2022 Facebook https://www.facebook.com/HandsOnMeditation\n\n#HandsOnMeditation\n\nWANT TO HELP SUPPORT THE CHANNEL?\n\u2615 Please, buy me a coffee  https://www.buymeacoffee.com/HandsOnMeditate\n\n________________________\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this approach to anxiety and stress relief.

    "Feel like I\u2019ve had a glass of wine when I\u2019ve finished this. Just what I needed and no hangover. This has really helped. Thx !",
    "The 4-7-8 count is so soothing. Thank you for this incredible gift!",
    "This technique really works. My blood pressure has been running high as long as I can remember. I began doing 10 or 20 minutes of low impact cardio. The following month I did my usual cardio and added 10 minutes of the 4-7-8 breathing exercise and my blood pressure dropped to safe levels. If I continue this regimen, hopefully I can get off my blood pressure medication, which is my goal. Thank you so much\ud83d\ude0a",
    "I am so glad that I found this. I like that you don&#39;t have any strong background music.",
    "Thank you so very much. I am 26 yrs old and was having high bp issues and after practicing it my bp literally went down everytime...It calmed my mind. I had started with your 10 minutes video and now able to do 20 mins as well. Lots of blessings. More power to you. \u2764"
