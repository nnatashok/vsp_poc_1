  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video from Yoga With Adriene titled 'Day 5 - Deepen | MOVE - A 30 Day Yoga Journey' appears to primarily embody the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The use of phrases like 'How you move matters' and comments about being enveloped in the practice indicate a focus on continuous, mindful movement patterns. The term 'beautiful flow' and 'no time had passed at all' further support this, giving it a strong score of 0.75.\n\nThe spirit of 'Soothing & Restorative' is also apparent, as the workout emphasizes developing a relationship with the 'subtle body and breath', promoting a sense of 'wholeness' and self-love, which are indicative of relaxation and healing goals. This is reinforced by comments reflecting personal growth and emotional wellness, warranting a score of 0.7.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are complemented by 'Structured & Disciplined' aspects, as it's part of a 30-day challenge, implying a planned progression and regular commitment, but since the emphasis is less on structured progression protocols, it scores moderately at 0.4."
