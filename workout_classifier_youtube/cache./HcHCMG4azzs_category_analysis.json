  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as 'Pilates' with a high score of 0.8 due to explicit mentions in both the title and description, such as 'standing pilates workout' and 'full body pilates workout.' The channel's focus on Pilates and the instructor's expertise also support this category, indicating strong alignment with Pilates principles. \n\nThe 'Mat' category is scored at 0.7, as the workout involves a variety of standing exercises often performed on a mat as indicated by descriptors like 'standing cardio' and 'full body workout at home.' These suggest mat-based movements primarily, though non-traditional in nature without lying down.\n\nFinally, 'Body weight' receives a moderate score of 0.5 since the workout's nature as a 'full body workout' and focus on 'muscle tone' indicate body-weight resistance. Additionally, the absence of equipment ('no jumping' and 'safe for the joints') implies that body weight is the primary load used.\n\nOther categories like 'HIIT' and 'Weight workout' were excluded due to lack of intensity indicators or equipment use descriptions."
