  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this video is 'The Zen Flow,' with a full score of 1.0. This is supported by the title and description focusing on mindfulness, being present, and stress reduction, which are all indicative of a slow, grounding, and intentional meditation session. The channel, 'The Mindful Movement,' further reinforces this by emphasizing meditation and mindful practices.\n\nA secondary vibe is 'The Deep Recharge' with a score of 0.7. The description and comments highlight elements of relaxation and mental reset, with users reporting peace and stress relief, both hallmarks of a session aiming for nervous system reset and relaxation. The music choice described as 'Meditative State' also supports this categorization.\n\nOther potential vibes such as 'The Sleep Prep' were considered but excluded as the session's goal isn't primarily to prepare for sleep, despite the gentle and relaxing nature. 'The Meditative Grind' was also excluded as the practice isn't about endurance or repetitive movement."
