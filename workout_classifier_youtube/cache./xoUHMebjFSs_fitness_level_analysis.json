  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves compound movements like 'DB Clean & Press' and 'Single DB Snatch' which require coordination and good form, indicating a moderate to high technique difficulty. These exercises typically fall within intermediate to advanced technique levels due to their requirement for proper execution to avoid injury. However, the comprehensive nature of a dumbbell workout allows for some adaptation based on user experience, supporting an intermediate classification as well.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of just over 20 minutes and the involvement of full-body exercises using dumbbells, the workout is likely to be physically demanding, particularly for deconditioned users. The continuous nature of a follow-along workout suggests limited rest, adding to the effort difficulty. This aligns well with moderate and challenging levels, acknowledging the possible intensity from using variations of weights. An extreme level could apply for those using heavy weights or at a very high pace.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.75,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The combination of advanced technical movements like a 'DB Clean & Press' and the challenging effort of a 20-minute non-stop workout suggests this session is best suited for those with some exercise experience, hence an intermediate to advanced fitness level. The variability of dumbbell weights allows personalization, permitting users to modulate intensity, which justifies the inclusion of these fitness levels. Given the possibility to adapt, beginners with guidance or prior exposure might attempt the workout, though it primarily aligns with intermediate to advanced users."
