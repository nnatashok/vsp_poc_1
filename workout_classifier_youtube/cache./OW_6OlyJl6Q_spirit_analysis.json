  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the '30 MIN KILLER STRENGTH Workout' video is 'High-Energy & Intense,' with a score of 0.9. The use of words like 'killer,' 'HIIT,' 'super sweaty,' and 'intense workout' in the title and metadata indicate a high-intensity session designed to push physical limits. The descriptions of 'calorie killer' and 'burn calories' support this, and viewer comments emphasize the workout's challenging nature, specifically noting terms like 'killer challenge' and 'worked every muscle.'\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Structured & Disciplined,' with a score of 0.7. The workout is methodically structured with specific intervals, such as '45 sec on, no rest' and '60 sec on, no rest,' indicating a disciplined approach. Viewer comments like 'slow and steady building up pace' point to the thought-out progression in intensity typical of structured workouts.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the focus on high-intensity and strength rather than flow or relaxation."
