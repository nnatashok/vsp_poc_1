  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'A Message from Your Successful Future Self (Guided Meditation)' is best classified under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a high confidence score of 0.95. This classification is based on several strong indicators found in the metadata. The title and description emphasize guidance ('Guided Meditation'), connection with the 'future self,' and positive transformation through gentle visualization, which are key elements of relaxation and healing. The description mentions releasing weight, letting go of fear and regret, and stepping into limitless possibilities, all indicative of a restorative experience focused on mental and emotional healing.\n\nFurther evidence comes from the user comments, which describe the meditation as healing, transformative, and emotionally moving (e.g., \"I cried tears from this, very healing\"). The channel's focus on meditation and the inclusion of calming background music also support this classification as Soothing & Restorative. There is no indication of high energy, structured discipline, or outdoor elements, effectively excluding other spirits. Overall, the metadata overwhelmingly supports a Soothing & Restorative spirit with nearly maximum confidence."
