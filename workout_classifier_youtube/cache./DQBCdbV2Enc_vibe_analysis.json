  "vibesExplanation": "The video 'Virtual Running Videos For Treadmill With Music | Virtual Run Mountain' primarily embodies the 'The Meditative Grind' vibe with a score of 0.7. This is due to its focus on a sustained virtual run which involves repetition and scenic visuals, promoting a 'zone in, lock down' experience as participants engage in treadmill running or running in place. The repeated visual of Mount Cook National Park creates a meditative aspect that captivates viewers in a continuous, focused activity. The choice of music also supports this experience, offering a background rhythm that aids in maintaining a consistent exercise pace.\n\nThe 'The Mindful Walk' vibe, scoring 0.6, is also relevant because the video offers an immersive scenic experience that allows viewers to enjoy the journey through visuals without requiring intensive effort. Comments from viewers like \"I just walked in place\" and \"enjoying the music & scenery\" highlight the meditative and immersive quality, making it similar to a guided, mindful walk.\n\nFinally, 'The Nature Flow', also scoring 0.6, applies as the workout simulates an outdoor adventure with beautiful scenery of a mountain trail, allowing users to connect with nature while being indoors. This vibe is supported by the scenic descriptions in the tags and viewer comments expressing gratitude for the opportunity to 'experience' the New Zealand landscape from home."
