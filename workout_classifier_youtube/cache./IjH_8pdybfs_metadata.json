    "When the workout is tough but then you do the stretch and realize just how broken your poor body is. Definitely coming back to this one every day to improve that mobility. Thank you!",
    "Love how she congratulates us after our workout and talks us through the whole video. Her voice sounds so pleasing too! Definitely coming back to this video",
    "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjH_8pdybfs&amp;t=697\">11:37</a> It&#39;s really nice to hear someone saying &quot;you are awesome and I love you&quot; in every morning. Thank you \u2764",
    "that felt like 2 minutes. I LOVE HER. I\u2019m a dancer and I just worked for about an hour and a half on a difficult hip-hop choreo that is very demanding stamina and strength-wise. Felt terrible but the stretch was very calming. I feel better already, we\u2019ll see how sore I am tomorrow \ud83d\udc93",
