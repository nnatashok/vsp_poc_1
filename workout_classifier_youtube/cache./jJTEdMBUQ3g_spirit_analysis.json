  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video '10 Minute First Trimester Prenatal Cardio Workout' primarily embodies the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, which is evident from the focus on smooth, pregnancy-safe cardio, as mentioned in the title and supported by comments noting participants felt good and warm after the session. The title also indicates a 'big calorie burn', hinting at a continuous and rhythmic cardio session, justifying a score of 0.7.\n\nAdditionally, 'High-Energy & Intense' elements are present. Despite being a prenatal workout, the comments describe the workout as quick, effective, and challenging, suggesting some level of intensity, although within a safe range for expectant mothers. This is reflected in the moderate score of 0.5.\n\nLastly, 'Soothing & Restorative' aspects are considered due to the prenatal focus and contentment expressed in user comments, implying a degree of rejuvenation. However, the workout's emphasis on cardio limits the strength of this spirit, resulting in a score of 0.4.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'Structured & Disciplined', were excluded due to the lack of emphasis on methodological training and technical precision in the metadata."
