  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Calisthenics' with a very high confidence (score 1.0). This is explicitly indicated by the title 'Best Bicep Workout (Calisthenics)', and reiterated multiple times in the tags and description with phrases such as 'Calisthenics Workout', and 'The BEST Calisthenics App'. The video is clearly centered around calisthenics movements designed for bicep growth. \n\nThe secondary category is 'Body weight' (score 0.7), given that the exercise routine primarily involves bodyweight resistance, an integral aspect of calisthenics. The user comments also refer to bodyweight exercises jargon such as \"Commando One Arm Negatives\", \"Ring Curls\", and \"One Arm Chin Up Hold,\" which confirm the use of body weight in the routine. Additionally, while there is mention of a weight vest, which could imply the use of additional weight, it mainly serves to enhance bodyweight exercises rather than imply a traditional weight workout. \n\nOther categories like 'Weight workout' were considered but excluded due to the core focus on calisthenics and body weight, as the weight vest is an optional enhancement rather than the primary method."
