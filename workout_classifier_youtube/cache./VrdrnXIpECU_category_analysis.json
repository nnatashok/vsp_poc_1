  "categoriesExplanation": "The video '15 Minute HIIT CARDIO INDOOR CYCLING WORKOUT' is primarily classified under the 'Indoor biking' category with a score of 1.0. This is due to explicit references to 'indoor cycling', 'cycling workout', 'spin class', and 'bike' in the title, description, and tags. The channel's focus is predominantly on cycling, as indicated by the channel name 'Kaleigh Cohen Cycling'. \n\nThe video is also classified under 'HIIT' with a score of 0.9, supported by the terms 'HIIT CARDIO' and 'burn fat' in the title and tags. The description mentions 'minimal recovery and maximum effort', which aligns with HIIT protocols. The structured interval format with segments like 'SPRINTS', 'INVERTED SPRINTS', and 'JUMPS/ FREEZES' also conforms to HIIT training characteristics. \n\nThere is high confidence in these classifications due to the strong presence of these elements throughout the metadata, leaving no ambiguity for other potential categories such as 'Mat', 'Running', or 'Body weight', which do not fit the context of an indoor cycling HIIT workout."
