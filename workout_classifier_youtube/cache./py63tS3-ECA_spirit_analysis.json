  "spiritsExplanation": "The video clearly embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as indicated by words such as \"relaxing full body stretches\" and \"gentle yoga,\" as well as emphasizing flexibility, mobility, and relaxation in the description. The high number of views and likes also highlights its effectiveness as a comforting routine. The presence of 'gentle' and 'easy' further supports a soothing approach rather than an intense one. Given these strong indicators for relaxation, a score of 0.9 was assigned.\n\nAdditionally, there is an element of 'Flow & Rhythm,' evidenced by the structure of a 20-minute continuous routine, promoting smooth and coordinated movement. Tags like \"stretching routine\" and \"yoga\" also suggest a rhythmic flow of exercises, warranting a score of 0.6. However, this flow aspect is secondary to its primary focus on relaxation and restoration. Other potential spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the lack of intensity and athletic focus in the metadata."
