    "I\u2019m loving the GCN spins, especially cause cause it\u2019s not a \u201cboot camp\u201d workout and I\u2019m loving that you aren\u2019t yelling at me! \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6",
    "This 35 minutes does me far more good than my relaxed hour sessions. Thank you from Somerset UK \ud83d\udc4d",
    "I am always going back to these training videos. Simon is superb just so professional generally  and has a relaxed quirky personality and great all round knowledge that keeps you returning to G.C.N on many fronts."
