  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily focused on 'Breathing exercises,' as evident from the title '10 Minute Morning Breathwork Routine To Start Your Day Anxiety Free' and repeated emphasis on 'breathwork' in the description and tags such as 'breathwork,' 'breathe,' 'anxietyrelief,' and 'mentalhealth.' The channel name 'Breathe With Sandy' and its focus on breathing techniques further reinforce this category. Therefore, this category is scored at 0.9 indicating strong presence.\n\n'Meditation' is also a relevant category due to references to 'mindfulness,' 'calm,' 'self-discovery,' and 'mental clarity' in the description and tags, suggesting a meditative aspect to the session. Comments and channel content further hint at a meditative practice, warranting a score of 0.7 for its presence. \n\nOther categories like 'Yoga' were mentioned in the tags but aren't strongly supported by the content, leading to their exclusion. Overall, the metadata strongly supports these two categories, leading to a high confidence level of 0.95 in this classification."
