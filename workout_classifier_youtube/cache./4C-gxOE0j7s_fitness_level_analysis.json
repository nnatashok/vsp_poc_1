  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The metadata suggests the technique difficulty is primarily 'Beginner'. The video is titled '5-Minute Morning Yoga', with specific phrases like 'yoga for beginners' and 'morning yoga for beginners' in the tags, indicating simplicity. Yoga movements usually involve basic postures in short routines aimed at newcomers. Intermediate technique difficulty is also considered due to yoga's inherent need for some coordination and balance, even in basic routines, as noted in comments appreciating the practice's mindfulness and balance benefits.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is mainly 'Beginner' due to the clearly stated targeting of all levels and use of basic yoga movements accessible for those new to the practice. However, comments from users incorporating it into daily routines suggest a moderate engagement that might appeal to 'Intermediate' users who are still developing their practice. The inclusion of 'Intermediate' recognizes slight complexity in technique and duration but acknowledges that most users without significant fitness barriers can partake comfortably."
