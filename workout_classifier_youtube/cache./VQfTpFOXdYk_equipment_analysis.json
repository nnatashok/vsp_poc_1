  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '5 Minute HIIT at Home - No Equipment Cardio HIIT Workouts - Full Body Workout without Equipment' explicitly states that it is a workout designed to be performed without any equipment. The tags reinforce this, repeatedly mentioning 'no equipment' and 'workout without equipment'. The description does not mention any necessary equipment for this specific workout, and the channel's focus on home and bodyweight workouts supports this classification. Despite other videos on the channel potentially using equipment like dumbbells, this specific video is clearly marketed as a no-equipment workout, aligning with a bodyweight-only routine. Therefore, no equipment is required for this workout."
