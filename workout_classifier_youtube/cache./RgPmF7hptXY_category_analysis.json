  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category, 'Breathing exercises,' was chosen based on explicit metadata indicators. The video title \"Guided Breathing: Escape The Monkey Mind\" suggests a focus on controlled breathing techniques. The description reinforces this by mentioning \"breathwork,\" and the explicit warning against performing it in certain conditions (e.g., not while driving) implies a focus on strategic breathing. Additionally, Kitaro Waga's channel and description establish his expertise as a 'breathwork coach,' and comments praise the video's effectiveness in guiding breath control and improving focus, indicating a central role of breathing exercises.\n\n'Meditation' is a secondary category with moderate to high confidence (0.6 score) due to the mention of \"Escape The Monkey Mind\" in the title, which aligns with meditative practices aimed at calming and clearing the mind. The channel's general focus on mindfulness further supports this classification. However, the primary emphasis on breath control justifies its secondary position."
