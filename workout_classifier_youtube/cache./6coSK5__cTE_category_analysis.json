  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is primarily a cardio session focused on burning belly fat, with specific emphasis on exercises that raise heart rate, as indicated by the title and tags such as 'cardio workout for abs' and 'burn belly fat at home'. These imply a cardiovascular workout done on a mat without equipment, leading to the classification under 'Mat' with a score of 0.75. Additionally, the channel description emphasizes body weight workouts, suggesting exercises that utilize the body as resistance rather than weights or machines, supporting a 'Body weight' classification with a score of 0.7. The absence of equipment or machine-related tags and an expressed focus on at-home workouts further rules out categories like 'HIIT', 'Treadmill', or 'Weight workout'. Although the video emphasizes cardio, its execution seems similar to aerobic mat exercises on the floor, justifying the selected categories."
