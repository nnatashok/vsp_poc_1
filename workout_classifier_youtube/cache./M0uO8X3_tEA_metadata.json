    "Loved this work out! And loved how no one talked during it, there was no &quot;come on, you can do it&quot;. Noup. They let me suffer in silence. No joke. Loved that.",
    "I started on january 2. 2025. <br>I do this workout 3-4 times a week, with the part where I do the workout I repeat 2x, or add some of my own exercises. With a calorie deficit and a starting weight of 120 kg (264 lbs) I now have 100 kg or (220 lbs)! Stay motivated!"
