  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves basic treadmill or stationary machine exercises, which are inherently simple and require minimal technique. This aligns closely with a 'Beginner' level because movements are straightforward and involve basic locomotion, such as walking or cycling. The classification is supported by metadata showing widespread use by older individuals and beginners. The potential for some coordination on machines slightly suggests potential intermediate involvement for those unfamiliar with equipment, hence a modest score at 'Intermediate'.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout provides a guided virtual tour designed to entertain and distract users during a 30-minute session. While extended in duration, it is meant to be a light cardio session given the context of users watching scenery on a screen while walking or cycling. The lack of explicit indications of high exertion or speed variations suggests that it could be classified as 'Light', possibly 'Moderate' due to its 30-minute duration which may require consistent, low-level physical effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the technique and effort difficulty, this workout is primarily suitable for beginners and can extend to intermediate fitness levels due to the alluded workout duration. The virtual scenery provides encouragement for prolonged exercise, which can accommodate the older audience or those less physically active, as recognized by the comments from older users. An advanced fitness level is moderately relevant since the duration could encourage a light jog for more fit users, explaining the additional scores for 'Intermediate' and 'Advanced' levels."
