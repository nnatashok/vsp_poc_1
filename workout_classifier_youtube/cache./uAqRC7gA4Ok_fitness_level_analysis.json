  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is clearly targeted at beginners, as indicated in both the title and description. The exercises mentioned in the tags, such as push-ups, squats, and crunches, are basic bodyweight movements that do not require high levels of coordination or advanced technique, making them beginner-friendly. Furthermore, the comments suggest that users find it accessible, reinforcing its alignment with beginner techniques. The mention of tabata and bodyweight resistance might slightly increase the complexity for complete novices, hence a small acknowledgment of intermediate-level potential is considered.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 10 minutes long and described as a 'light workout session' for beginners. Estimated calorie burn is low, and it's stated to be suitable even for warming up, suggesting minimal physical exertion. Comments from users who are severely untrained further suggest that the workout is not overly demanding. The tags indicate elements like 'fat burning' and 'tabata,' which are slightly more intense, earning it a mild moderate score, but largely it remains light in effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the combination of beginner-level technique and light effort, the workout is highly suitable for beginners, as emphasized in the content description and comments. The inclusion of tabata could imply a slightly faster pace, and experienced users might use it as a warm-up, justifying a low intermediate level alignment. Feedback indicates it is manageable for users new to exercise, which aligns with a high beginner score. Ultimately, the simplicity of movements and short duration strongly favor beginners, with some potential appeal to intermediates using it at a higher intensity or doubled-up."
