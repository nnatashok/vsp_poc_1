    "Thank you Shelly, I been following you since COVID but, not consistently... My female docter said I needed strength training with weights 3/week so, I have returned! (I&#39;m 70 years young!) THANK YOU",
    "Hi there from Adelaide Australia.  Im 73 year old woman who now fully understands the importance of weight bearing exercise. I\u2019ve been meeting up with you every two days for the last couple of weeks. I use 2 x 4 kg weights (about 9lb). I\u2019m enjoying every moment.  I love the way you present the show and I love love love your little dog.  I also love that I can do this in my own home with only my dog, Trevor to judge me.  Thank you so much.",
    "I&#39;m a huge fan of these 30 minute full body weighted workouts. Keep &#39;em coming! The squats with the upper body weights, phew, felt those! I used 8lb and 10lb weights but I&#39;m thinking I can go up a bit on a couple of exercises!  Thanks Schellea,  you are such a star and inspiration! \u2764",
    "I loved it! I used 3, 5 and 8 lbs. I plan to do a 15min walk video after lunch. I know I need to do strength training,  so more 30min dumbbell workouts pls. Thank you!"
