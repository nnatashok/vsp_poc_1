    "I just made a decision to do this instead of attempting suicide. I was desperate to escape my pain. <br><br>Someone sent me this as I\u2019m a huge fan of Wim Hof. Fortunately I chose to try this first. Got to round 8 and couldn\u2019t stop crying and shaking. <br><br>I think I\u2019ll get through these next few hours now. <br><br>Thank you for saving my life today. Whoever you are. God bless you\u2026\ud83d\ude4c\u2764\ufe0f",
    "I&#39;ve been doing your 10 rounds of breathing for about 2 months now followed by an ice bath. Some of the things I noticed  is, I&#39;m mentally sharper and faster than people around me. I&#39;m aware of breathing deeply through out the day. I don&#39;t procrastinate as much. I&#39;m sticking to my workouts more. I don&#39;t need the acceptance of others. My intuition is spot on. I look better,  feel better,  and  I&#39;m more optimistic about my life. I seem to attract more younger pretty women. Even men are more attracted to me, in a none sexual way. Some guys seem to be jealous of me especially when there women are around me. That let&#39;s me know I&#39;m doing it right. I did 3 rounds of breathing for about a year, then I did 6 rounds of breathing for about 2 years.  I can feel a major difference between 6 rounds and 10 rounds. 3 rounds of breathing and a cold shower per day made me feel really good for a long time, 10 rounds of breathing and a daily ice bath put me on a superhuman level,  spiritually, physically,  and mentally. Thanks for your videos.  You are doing the lords work."
