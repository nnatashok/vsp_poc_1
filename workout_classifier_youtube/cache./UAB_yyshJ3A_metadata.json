    "Thank you for joining me today! \ud83d\udca8 Get my NEW free 15-day breathwork course here: <a href=\"https://kitarowaga.kit.com/15-day-breathwork-course\">https://kitarowaga.kit.com/15-day-breathwork-course</a>",
    "I do this breathing session every morning on waking. It&#39;s helped me get through morning anxiety left over from Covid lockdowns and heal my lungs from asthma.  I start my day feeling revitalized, smiling and ready to take my goodness out into the world! \ud83d\udc9b\ud83c\udf1f \ud83e\udd17 Sending love. Light and gratitude from Australia. <br>Peaceful blessings to all <br>\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f \ud83d\ude4f",
    "i was coming down with something real bad and started doing the practice. did about 100 rounds &quot;no joke^^&quot; and said to myself i am not getting sick, fell asleep, and when i woke up i almost completely got rid of the sickness. the whm is some of the most legit info i recieved in my life.",
    "Thank you for bringing your goodness to the world!",
    "Thank you, your emphasis on mindfully focusing on the form and less on just the function of sucking in air made it feel less like a \u201cmethod\u201d or exercise and more like a meditative practice."
