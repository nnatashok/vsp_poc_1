    "Love reading the comments. Hearing about people getting sleep makes me feel so happy \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 hope everyone sleeps well tonight xx",
    "You two probably have no idea how big of an impact you are making on peoples lives. I do not think I would have survived graduate school without these videos, and I certainly won&#39;t make it through medical school without them. Thank you both so very much for taking the time to make these, and then putting them in this medium so everyone can use them. If they had not been free I never would have tried them, and they have helped me so damn much over the last three years. Thank you, thank you, thank you, and god bless you both.",
    "I suffered a brain injury in an auto accident in 2019, and I&#39;ve often had  difficulty with sleep. I found this video in the fall of 2019 and have listened to it countless times since. I&#39;ve also recommended it to friends. I can&#39;t thank you enough!",
    "I was having an anxiety attack last night from so much stress and I put this video on. I started the breathing technique and it helped me relax and fall asleep. I woke up this morning a little anxious and I played this video again. I feel completely relaxed now and ready to start the day. Thank you so much for these awesome videos and for changing people&#39;s lives. \u2764 \ud83d\ude4f"
