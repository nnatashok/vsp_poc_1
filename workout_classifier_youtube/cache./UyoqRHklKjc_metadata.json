  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "Oh boy - this workout embodies &quot;tiny but MIGHTY!&quot; Don&#39;t let the &quot;15 mins express&quot; title fool you. This will give you a burning but totally rewarding sweat!!",
    "I don\u2019t know how you can kill me in 18 minutes-but THANK YOU. You have changed my life Nicole\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25",
    "Love your classes. Please add more 10 min stretch and 15-20 min Pilates and yoga flow videos. I don\u2019t have enough time for the longer ones and don\u2019t like to stop mid stream and not finish out the workout without a wind down and final zen moment. Thank you for your time and efforts. You are greatly appreciated.\u2764",
    "Some of these moves can be really challenging, so I tell myself: If Mick Jagger can do yoga and pilates at 80, so can I at 46. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udcaa Thank you Nicole for keeping us motivated and for always reminding us on a correct breathing technique.\ud83d\ude0a",
    "Thank you, Nicole, for all of your amazing classes! I started doing them in the beginning of the year, and now I do them as part of my daily routine and I feel better both physically and mentally because of them. It&#39;s one of the things in my day that I truly look forward to!  Thank you! \ud83d\ude00"
