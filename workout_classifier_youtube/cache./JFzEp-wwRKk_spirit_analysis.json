  "spiritsExplanation": "The title 'PERFECT 15 MINUTE FAT MELTING HIIT CARDIO WORKOUT' immediately signals a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, emphasizing rapid fat burning and high-intensity interval training. The descriptor 'fat melting' alongside 'HIIT' and 'cardio' underscores this classification, as these terms are associated with vigorous and high-intensity workouts designed to push limits (score: 0.95). The tag 'high-intensity interval training' and related comments about the workout being challenging and heart-pumping reinforce this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the workout's mention of a systematic full-body routine and the suggestion to perform it 2-3 times a week highlights a 'Structured & Disciplined' aspect. The inclusion of a specific routine targeting all major muscle groups with prescribed frequencies indicates a methodical approach to training (score: 0.7).\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm,' 'Soothing & Restorative,' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the lack of indicators related to smooth movement, relaxation, or environmental elements respectively. The consistency in the metadata focusing on intensity and structured routine facilitates a high-confidence assignment."
