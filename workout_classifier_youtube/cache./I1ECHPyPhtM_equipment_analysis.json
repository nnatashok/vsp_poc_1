  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"Guided Meditation with Mooji \u2014 The Call From Within\" does not mention any physical workout or fitness activities that typically require equipment. The description, tags, and content focus on meditation, spirituality, and self-realization, which suggest a mental and meditative practice rather than a physical one. Meditation typically does not require physical equipment beyond perhaps a comfortable seating arrangement. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the metadata, so we classify this as a workout that requires no equipment, thus appearing to be bodyweight only (or more accurately, no equipment required for meditation)."
