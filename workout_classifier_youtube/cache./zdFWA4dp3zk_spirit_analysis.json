  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a very high confidence score of 0.95. The video's title, '15 Minute Energy Cleanse (Guided Meditation)', and the description emphasize a focus on 'rejuvenating', 'release', 'balance', 'gentle visualization', and 'intentional breathing'. These elements are strongly indicative of a restorative approach aimed at reducing stress and tension, which aligns perfectly with the Soothing & Restorative spirit.\n\nIn addition, 'Flow & Rhythm' is applicable to a degree (0.65) as the meditation likely uses a smooth, continuous, and rhythmic structure typical of guided meditations, which often involves flowing narration and music to maintain focus and coherence. The user comments highlight the peaceful and flowing nature of the session, further supporting this classification.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', or 'Sport & Agility' are not applicable due to the lack of indicators related to high intensity, strict structure, or sports-specificity. The meditation's indoor and introspective nature also excludes the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit."
