  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled '10 min Yoga for Beginners - Gentle & Simple Yoga Stretch' specifies in its description and tags that no props are required for the practice. Phrases like 'no props required' and tags such as 'yoga without props' and 'no props yoga' indicate that this session is specifically designed to be equipment-free, relying solely on bodyweight exercises. The focus on foundational yoga poses such as low lunge, downward dog, cobra, and bridge pose further supports the bodyweight-only approach commonly found in basic yoga sessions. Thus, no additional equipment is identified as necessary, affirming that the workout is intended to be performed without any aids."
