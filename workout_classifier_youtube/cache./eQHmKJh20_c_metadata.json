    "I love that you\u2019re doing this in such a casual setting to show that anyone can do this anywhere in their home! I\u2019m def gonna try and do this at least weekly :)",
    "Man, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQHmKJh20_c&amp;t=750\">12:30</a> and I\u2019m having a really bad time with staying consistent with studies and I wasted my whole day today. I sat down and did this routine and I feel sm better abt myself now. Ur casualness is so inviting.",
    "I officially completed 1 year of doing this continuously, and I just wanna say THANK YOU SO MUCH, my body is never the same and I\u2019m never quitting this video \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25",
    "If anyone is here reading this, DO NOT GIVE UP ON THIS! <br>I used to do this daily and never saw the true effect of it until i stopped. After a damaged back and super tight muscles due to the contact sports i play, i&#39;m having to put so much effort into an injury which was avoidable by keeping my muscles active.<br>I never realised how much more flexible i got and how much doing this on a day-to-day basis helped me out keeping my muscles in better shape. <br>I have come back to this and ill post an update in a couple weeks to let you know my process (again)<br>Edit- Its been two weeks and although i still have pain, it is helping. i am able to stretch much further than i was two weeks ago and stretching is less uncomfortable too."
