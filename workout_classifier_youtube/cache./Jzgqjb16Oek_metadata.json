  "title": "The PERFECT 10 Minute HIIT Cardio Workout To Lose Fat (Gym or Home)",
  "description": "Unfortunately, HIIT has been abused by the fitness industry and used totally out of context. Most HIIT workouts you\u2019ll find on the internet and probably experimented with are not true HIIT and won\u2019t deliver the unique benefits that HIIT has to offer. In today\u2019s video though, I\u2019ll show you how to design a true HIIT workout for you to use. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have access to equipment or not; my example HIIT workout is suitable for use at home with no equipment or at the gym. Plus, I\u2019ll also go through how to properly implement a HIIT workout to maximize your results (e.g. if you\u2019re looking for fat loss) with the routine. \n\nMaintaining a high enough intensity and an elevated heart rate is by far the single most important factor there is when performing HIIT. To ensure you\u2019re working hard enough, first, get your heart rate to around at least 85% of your max heart rate. Second, during your rest intervals, keep moving at a moderate intensity. This will not only help increase your overall oxygen consumption which ultimately leads to more calories burned and greater physiological improvements, but will also ensure that your average heart rate remains high enough throughout the whole HIIT session.\n\nThere\u2019s no set protocol for a HIIT workout, nor is there a perfect ratio for your work:rest intervals. That said, the research indicates that a 2:1 work:rest ratio may be the most time efficient. But, keep in mind that your current level of fitness will govern what work:rest ratio is most appropriate for you. But intensity is what\u2019s most important. Something like a 1:2 work:rest ratio (e.g. 30 second sprint with 1 minute brisk walk in between) would be a good starting point, which can eventually be progressed to a 1:1 work:rest ratio (e.g. 30 second sprint with 30 second brisk walk in between),  and then even a 2:1 work:rest ratio if appropriate (e.g. 30 second sprint intervals with a 15 second brisk walk in between). \n\nIf you\u2019re at the gym, a simple yet effective option are sprints on an exercise bike. But you can essentially use any modality you have available (rowing machine, assault bike, treadmill) and perform your HIIT workout on that. For rest intervals, you would simply perform that exercise at a slower pace. Now if you\u2019re performing your HIIT workout at home with no equipment, then all you need is your bodyweight. In addition to burpees, other effective bodyweight exercises include squat jumps, jump lunges, running in place, mountain climbers, jump rope, star jumps, and shadow boxing. Avoid using strength training exercises as they make it tough to reach your target heart rate safely. \n\nThe duration of your workout and how many rounds you want to commit to ultimately depends on your goals and why you\u2019re doing HIIT. If you\u2019re trying to improve or maintain your cardiovascular fitness: a HIIT workout as short as 8-minutes with a 1:1 work:rest ratio is adequate. But if you\u2019re performing a HIIT workout for fat loss, then you\u2019re going to need to work a little longer since HIIT was primarily designed to increase performance rather than shed belly fat by burning a ton of calories. \n\nHere are 2 examples of how to structure your HIIT workout - both using a 1:1 work to rest ratio. Feel free to tweak the work:rest ratio and durations to better suit your fitness levels.\n\n10-Minute Home HIIT Workout \n\nWORK - Burpees: 1 Minute\nACTIVE REST* \u2013 1 Minute\nWORK - Mountain climbers: 1 Minute\nACTIVE REST \u2013 1 Minute \nWORK - Squat Jumps: 1 Minute\nACTIVE REST \u2013 1 Minute \nWORK \u2013 Running in place: 1 Minute\nACTIVE REST \u2013 1 Minute \nWORK \u2013 Jump Rope: 1 Minute\nACTIVE REST \u2013 1 Minute\n\n*Can jog in place or perform light jumping jacks\n\n10-Minute Cycling Workout\n\nWORK \u2013 High Intensity Cycling: 1 Minute\nACTIVE REST \u2013 Light Cycling: 1 Minute\nRepeat x5\n\nAs for how often to do these HIIT workouts, generally, I\u2019d recommend between 1-3 times per week, as they are quite intense and will require adequate recovery. But all in all, I hope you were able to see what a true HIIT workout really entails and how to structure one based on your needs. Just keep in mind though that when it comes to transforming your body, HIIT is just one tool in the toolbox and has its place. But knowing how to also properly incorporate steady state cardio, weight training sessions, and your nutrition into your overall plan is what\u2019s key to transforming your body as efficiently as possible.

    "My favourite form of HIIT is doing sprinting. I sprint from 1 end of a football pitch to the other and walk back, and then repeat. Around 10 minutes is all it takes. I also like doing high knees with a 20 on, 10 off approach. \ud83d\ude0a"
