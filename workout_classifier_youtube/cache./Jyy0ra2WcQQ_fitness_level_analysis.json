  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video's guided meditation requires very low physical effort as it is designed to induce relaxation rather than physical exertion. The content revolves around mental relaxation and possibly stress reduction as seen in tags like \"deep relaxation\" and \"ocean waves.\" The duration of 18 minutes is relatively short for a meditation session, supporting a Light effort classification. Comments highlight the calming and comforting effect, further confirming the light nature of the effort required.",
