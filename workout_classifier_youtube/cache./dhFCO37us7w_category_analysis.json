  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Stretching' with a high confidence score of 0.9 due to the clear emphasis on stretching throughout the metadata. The title 'Post Workout Stretch | Full Body | 15 Minutes of Stress Relief & Recovery' explicitly indicates that the video is focused on stretching exercises. Additionally, multiple tags such as 'post workout stretch', 'stretching exercises', and 'stretching after workout' reinforce this classification. Comments also support the stretching focus, with viewers referring to it as a 'cool down stretch' and 'favorite Mr. And Mrs. Muscle video' for its peaceful nature.\n\nA secondary category of 'Yoga' is assigned with a score of 0.4. This is due to some overlap in the tags, including 'yoga', 'yoga for beginners', and 'stretch yoga', suggesting that elements of yoga, particularly those related to relaxation and flexibility, may be a part of the workout. However, the primary emphasis remains on stretching rather than traditional yoga poses or practice.\n\nOther categories like HIIT or Body weight were considered irrelevant due to lack of any related terms in the metadata."
