  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video focuses on full body stretches described as effective post-workout or for active recovery, suggesting simple movements typical of Beginner levels. The description includes broad cues like breathing and core engagement which are not complex. User comments praise the video's simplicity, and the channel offers easy-to-follow workouts suggesting a Beginner technique difficulty. However, since it's intended as a recovery tool potentially after intense workouts, there's a light Intermediate score for those with some existing flexibility and body awareness.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The stretch routine focuses on muscle recovery and stress relief from intense workouts. Technique and effort difficulties suggest suitability primarily for Beginners, as a low-impact recovery session. However, due to its potential as a complement to strenuous activity post-intense workouts, it also garners an Intermediate score, providing utility for users with some flexibility experience or active recovery needs. The video\u2019s simple approach and user comments about its utility during stress or post-workout further support multi-level accessibility."
