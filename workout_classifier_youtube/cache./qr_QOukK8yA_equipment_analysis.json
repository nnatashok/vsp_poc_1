  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video's title, \"60 Minute Indoor Cycling Workout | Endurance Ride,\" and the tags such as \"Indoor Cycling,\" \"Indoor Bike,\" and \"Spin\" indicate that an exercise bike is required for the workout. The description involves phrases like \"this journey will incorporate two focussed blocks of intensity,\" clearly implying that the workout involves cycling on a stationary bike. The high confidence score of 1.0 is assigned because an exercise bike is central to completing the workout, as reinforced by the explicit focus on indoor cycling throughout the metadata."
