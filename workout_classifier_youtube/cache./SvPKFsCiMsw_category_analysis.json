  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily identified as a 'Yoga' session due to the repeated use of 'yoga' in the title, description, and tags such as '10 minute yoga full body stretch,' 'yoga for stiff bodies,' and 'yoga stretch.' The channel, 'Yoga With Bird,' also focuses on yoga practices, further strengthening this categorization. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong emphasis on yoga.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Stretching,' as indicated by the mentions of 'full body stretch' and 'stretches for stiff body' in the tags and description. The video is designed to release tension and stiffness, which aligns with typical goals of stretching routines. The score of 0.8 acknowledges that stretching is a significant component of the workout, though secondary to yoga.\n\nWhile the video is described as a 'yoga class,' the focus on 'full body stretch' and addressing 'stiff bodies' might have slight overlap with stretching exercises beyond standard yoga postures, justifying the dual categorization."
