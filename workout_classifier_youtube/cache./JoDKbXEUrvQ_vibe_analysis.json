  "vibesExplanation": "The video strongly embodies 'The Deep Recharge' vibe due to its focus on pranayama and breathwork, targeting stress release and mental calm, which aligns with the description's emphasis on calming the mind and releasing stress. The title and description explicitly mention deep breathing exercises with a calming, grounding purpose, justifying a high score of 0.9. \n\n'Zen Flow' is also a fitting vibe, indicated by the breath-centered, mindful approach to the exercises. Keywords like 'Yogic breathing,' 'calm the mind,' and 'comfortable spot' suggest a practice that is unhurried and intentional, earning a score of 0.8. \n\nThe 'Reboot Workout' vibe aligns moderately due to its total-body refresh focus. The practices outlined are gentle and restorative, offering a refreshing restart to one's day, particularly following the comments that mention a notable increase in comfort and improvement in breathing post-COVID. This warrants a score of 0.7.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Comfort Moves' were considered but excluded due to the more intention-driven nature of the exercises rather than their accessibility or focus on physical comfort alone."
