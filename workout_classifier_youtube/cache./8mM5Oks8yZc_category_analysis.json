  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Meditation', supported by multiple explicit references in the title, tags, description, and user comments. The keywords 'Yoga Nidra', 'guided meditation', 'relaxation', and 'calms the nervous system' all indicate a focus on meditation practices. Yoga Nidra is a form of guided meditation specifically designed for relaxation and mental rest, which aligns closely with the outlined characteristics of the 'Meditation' category. The second category is 'Yoga', as 'Yoga Nidra' is described as a yogic sleep technique, and the channel focuses on yoga practices. The description mentions 'yogic sleep', and the channel's themes revolve around yoga education and teacher training, reinforcing this connection. The scoring reflects a strong presence of meditation elements (0.9) and a significant, though secondary involvement of yoga (0.8). Other categories were excluded as there were no elements of physical postures or exercises typically associated with other yoga forms or workout types."
