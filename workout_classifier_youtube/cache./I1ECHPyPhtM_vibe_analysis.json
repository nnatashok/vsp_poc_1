  "vibesExplanation": "The workout vibe that best fits this video is 'The Zen Flow' due to multiple indicators of a grounding, intentional, and breath-centered experience. The title 'Guided Meditation with Mooji \u2014 The Call From Within' suggests a focus on internal awareness and calmness, aligning with a zen-like experience. The description emphasizes 'stillness' and 'presence,' which are key components of a 'Zen Flow' exercise. The tags such as 'meditation,' 'truth,' 'self-realization,' and 'awareness' reinforce the idea of a calm, introspective practice designed for a tranquil state of mind. I assigned a score of 0.95, reflecting the strong match of the content with the 'Zen Flow' vibe.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Deep Recharge' is applicable with a score of 0.8, as the meditation offers a deep relaxation and nervous system reset. Phrases like 'be fully here, in the presence of God' and 'let go and experience emptiness' suggest an opportunity for deep rest and rejuvenation typically associated with such a vibe.\n\nThe absence of physical or dynamic exercises excludes other potential vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Groove Session.' The confidence level for these assignments is high (0.9) based on explicit and implicit cues within the metadata."
