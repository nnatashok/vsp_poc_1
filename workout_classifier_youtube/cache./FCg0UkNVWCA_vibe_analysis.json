  "vibesExplanation": "The chosen vibes are well-supported by the metadata and workout nature. 'The Reboot Workout' (0.75) is a strong match because the title and description focus on improving mobility, flexibility, and recovery, with a specific emphasis on a deep, full-body stretch. The routine also offers a quick 15-minute routine aimed at refreshing the body. This indicates a restorative and refreshing quality.\n\n'The Comfort Moves' (0.7) is applicable because of the gentle and accessible nature of the exercise, as indicated by keywords like \"gentle reminder\", and the comments highlighting the relaxing and wake-up boost the routine provides. The description also encourages making the workout one's own, suggesting a custom, comfortable pace.\n\n'The Zen Flow' (0.55) is included due to the breath-centered and unhurried stretch session described. The video being filmed in a scenic location in Greece further adds a calming and serene aspect to the routine similar to 'Zen Flow'.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded due to the lack of high-intensity or explosive elements, fitting more into restorative and calming categories."
