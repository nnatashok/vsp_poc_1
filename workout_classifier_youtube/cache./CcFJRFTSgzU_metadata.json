If this happens, reduce the number of practice rounds and soften your breaths. It\u2019s important to increase gradually, not forcefully.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:32 - Round One\n3:52 - Round Two\n7:26 - Round Three\n11:14 - Round Four\n15:33 - Round Five",

    "Today I found this for the first time, it is the most intense breathing exercise I have done in many years!<br>Thank you so much!<br>It was a bit scary during the long pause without air, but the voice telling to feel safe comforted me and made feel secure,,, this is at another level!<br>even tears are coming out of my eyes on their own without any feeling , I think it is just TOTAL RELAXATION IN MY BODY.<br>Absolutely amazing exercise!<br>Can\u2019t thank you enough!",
    "Just cracked 60+ days of doing this every day, sometimes 2 to 3 times a day. I am calmer, happier and more productive. If you&#39;re reading this - highly recommend you do the same and see what happens. Much love to all.",
    "Yes, you\u2019re back. My wife and I had been using the former YouTube video daily for over a year. When we couldn\u2019t access the video on YouTube, we used the website version. Thank you.",
    "After struggling to reach 1 min 30 seconds, I am now able to reach 2 min 30 sec to 3 minutes almost every single time. Thank you!!",
    "Wow\u2026. I did this for the first time and kept up well. My whole nervous system has slowed down. Even typing this message feels slow. During the breath holds, I felt immense pulses of energy traveling through me, and now all that\u2019s left is pure relaxation and warmth."
