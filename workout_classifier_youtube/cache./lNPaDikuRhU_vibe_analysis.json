  "vibesExplanation": "The workout titled '15 Minute Gentle Full Body Stretch' by Jessica Valant is classified primarily as 'The Reboot Workout' due to multiple indicators of a gentle and relaxing experience. The description highlights keywords such as 'gentle full body stretch,' 'relaxed,' 'rejuvenated,' and 'safe,' which strongly connect with the 'Reboot Workout' vibe focused on a total-body refresh. This vibe was assigned a score of 0.9 due to repeated emphasis on relaxation and rejuvenation.\n\n'Comfort Moves' was selected as a secondary vibe with a score of 0.75. The metadata and comments refer to 'gentle stretch routine' and users appreciating the non-stressful, comfortable approach. This aligns with the channel's focus on making movement accessible and enjoyable without pressure.\n\nThe 'Zen Flow' vibe was also considered but assigned a lower score of 0.6. The video description and user feedback suggest a calming routine, which can relate to 'Zen Flow,' but less emphasis is placed on breath-centered or grounding practices typical of this vibe. Thus, it is a mild influence rather than a dominant aspect in this workout."
