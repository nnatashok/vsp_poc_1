  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Yoga' and 'Stretching' based on the title, description, and tags. The title '20 min Full Body STRETCH/YOGA for STRESS & ANXIETY Relief' explicitly mentions both yoga and stretching, suggesting a combination of these practices. The tags such as 'stress relief yoga,' 'de-stress yoga,' 'yoga for anxiety,' and 'light stretch' reinforce this classification, particularly for a routine intended to relieve stress and anxiety. The description further clarifies this as a 'calming yoga routine' that includes 'light and easy full body stretches,' supporting the dual classification. The mention of stress and anxiety suggests a focus on relaxation and gentle movement, common in both yoga and stretching.\n\nA secondary classification as 'Breathing exercises' was considered due to user comments mentioning improved breathing, particularly 'this has helped me breathe better by expanding and working my lungs,' suggesting some breathing focus. However, since neither the title nor the description explicitly mention dedicated breathing exercises, it is given a lower score. The consistent emphasis on yoga and stretching activities solidify them as the primary categories."
