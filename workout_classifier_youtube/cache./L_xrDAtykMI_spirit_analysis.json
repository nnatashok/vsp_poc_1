  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily categorized as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.9 due to its focus on gentle stretching and flexibility improvement. This is evidenced by the title '15 Minute Beginner Stretch Flexibility Routine!' and tags such as 'beginner flexibility routine', 'stretching exercises for beginners', and 'stretching for flexibility'. The workout aims to be accessible with a follow-along format, ideal for stress reduction and relaxation, as supported by the comments highlighting relief from stiffness and back pain.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is secondary, scored at 0.65, because the routine involves a sequence of movements like 'child pose', 'hip swivels', and 'lunge with twist', which are often performed smoothly and rhythmically, as alluded to by the structured timestamp breakdown. Comments mentioning the routine as 'slow paced' also suggest a rhythmic aspect that contributes to a mind-body connection. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the overall gentle nature of the routine."
