  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves spinning, which is primarily a cardio-focused exercise with basic cycling movements. However, spin classes can also involve some moderately complex techniques depending on the instructor's choreography or additional movements beyond basic pedaling (such as standing sprints). The description and comments suggest accessibility for beginners post-pregnancy, indicating basic movements, but also mention endurance and pushing limits, which aligns with some intermediate technical requirements. Therefore, both Beginner and Intermediate levels are relevant, with a mild mention of Advanced due to potential standing or high-intensity choreography.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.72,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 45-minute spin session, which typically involves sustained effort and moderate to high heart rates. Viewer comments mention pushing heart rates to limits and the workout's intensity being a significant part of the mindset for endurance sports. This suggests a Challenging effort level, especially given the duration. There's also an indication that the workout could verge on Extreme for those less conditioned, as it mimics high-intensity endurance sessions, though this is less likely as main focus.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.74,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the technique and effort difficulties, the required fitness level leans toward Intermediate, especially as it's accessible post-pregnancy. However, given the 45-minute duration and potential for intense effort, it's also likely that various parts of the workout could align more with Advanced users who have greater aerobic fitness. The workout\u2019s accessibility points to Intermediate; however, the endurance mentioned and the full duration could prove demanding, justifying Advanced as another applicable level."
