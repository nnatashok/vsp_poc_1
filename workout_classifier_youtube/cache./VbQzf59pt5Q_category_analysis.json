  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Weight workout' with a score of 0.9. The video explicitly focuses on building muscle using dumbbells, as indicated by repeated mentions such as 'dumbbell workout over 50' in both the title and description. The description further elaborates on using exercises like presses, squats, and rows, which are typically part of weight training routines. This focus on resistance training aligns with the 'Weight workout' category.\n\nWhile there is some implicit presence of bodyweight exercises in the broader sense of a full-body routine, the emphasis remains heavily on dumbbell exercises, which is why 'Body weight' was given a minor score of 0.1.\n\nThe choice of categories excludes options like 'HIIT', 'Calisthenics', or 'Mat', as there is no indication of high-intensity intervals, gymnastic movements, or pure floor exercises. The content is clearly aimed at older adults looking to use weight-based exercises for muscle development, which aligns with the weight training focus of the video."
