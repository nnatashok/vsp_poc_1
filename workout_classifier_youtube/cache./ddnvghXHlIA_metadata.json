    "It feels so good when it says &#39; You have successfully completed the workout&#39; and &#39; good job&#39;",
    "I lost almost 10 kg with this exercise,  walking 1hour 30 minutes a day and proper diet within 93 days ... Today is 93rd day ..thank you  Robertaa\u2764",
    "I love these &#39;no jumping&#39; exercises because I live in an apartment and my neighbors would probably hate me if I had to jump. Also, great workouts for heavier people like myself.",
    "Is it just me or does anyone get embarrassed when you exercise and your parents or siblings walk in",
    "The counting during the plank is the longest 15 in my life omg\ud83d\ude23<br>But I enjoyed the work out! I\u2019m doing it before bed because the exercise helps me to sleep better. Really loved it! Also, after following this channel for a few years tonight was the first time I actually attempted the super mans! It was a bit tricky to get it at first but now I can do it! Thanks!\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc9c"
