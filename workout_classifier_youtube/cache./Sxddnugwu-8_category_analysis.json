  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Yoga,' which is evident from both the title 'Yoga For Depression - Yoga With Adriene' and the tags that include 'yoga for depression,' 'yoga for stress relief,' 'yoga for anxiety,' and 'yoga practice.' These suggest a strong focus on yoga as a form of physical and emotional therapy. The description further supports this by mentioning 'mindful yoga,' which connects physical and emotional healing, and a focus on breath work. The channel 'Yoga With Adriene' is dedicated to yoga content, enhancing confidence in this classification. 'Breathing exercises' is a secondary category due to references in the description to focusing on breath, which is a key component of yoga practices aimed at balancing the nervous system. The overall confidence level for these categories is high (0.9) based on the data provided, despite the lack of explicit mention of breathing techniques throughout the metadata."
