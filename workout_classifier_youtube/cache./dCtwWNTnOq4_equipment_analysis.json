  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is explicitly titled \"10 min Upper Body Workout With Dumbbells,\" indicating that dumbbells are necessary for performing the exercises. The title specifies \"Arms, Back, Chest\" which typically requires weights for effective workout routines. Furthermore, the tags such as \"dumbbell workout,\" \"upper body dumbbell workout,\" and \"upper body workout with dumbbells\" reinforce that dumbbells are a central part of this workout. The description further clarifies that the workout includes exercises for back, chest toning, and arms, which are often performed using dumbbells. Based on this evidence, I have assigned a very high confidence score of 0.9 to the requirement of dumbbells for this workout."
