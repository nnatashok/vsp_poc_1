  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The breathing exercise video titled \"Powerful Nose Breathing Exercises | 3x 60 Breaths\" is focused on guided breathing techniques without the need for physical workout equipment. The description specifies that participants can perform the exercises lying down or sitting in a comfortable chair, indicating that a mat or chair might be used, but these are not explicitly required for the breathing techniques themselves. The emphasis is on breathing patterns and meditation, with no mention of traditional fitness equipment like dumbbells or mats being necessary. Therefore, this workout appears to be bodyweight only, requiring no specific equipment for execution."
