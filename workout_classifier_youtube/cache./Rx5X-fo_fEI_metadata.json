  "title": "Guided Mindfulness Meditation - Go Easy on Yourself - Self-care and Self-Love (15 Minutes)",
  "description": "This is a new guided mindfulness meditation focused on caring for yourself and showing love for yourself - GO EASY on yourself! I'll bet you are the kind of person who takes on big challenges and puts a lot of pressure on yourself. As the saying goes, we are often our own worst critics. Meditating and being mindful of what pressures cause us stress and anxiety can lead to a healthier mental state. Although it can be healthy to hold ourselves to a high standard, we don't want to work ourselves into a loss of personal well-being.\n\nLet the dialogue and ambient music soundtrack guide you. The calm and peaceful guided meditation dialogue lasts for about 12 minutes, followed by a few minutes of ambient music to bring you back out of meditation - 15 minutes total. You really can take it EASY on yourself!\n\n----\n\nI strive to create some of the most calming and relaxing online guided meditations on YouTube - I hope you find them to be some of the best out there! Some of the most popular topics are better sleep, morning sessions, and healing anxiety. The ambient music sessions can be great for either non-verbal meditation or yoga.
