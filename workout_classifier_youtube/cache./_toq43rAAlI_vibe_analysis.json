  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified is 'The Zen Flow' due to the strong emphasis on grounding, breath-centered practices, and intentional tranquility, as indicated by the title 'A Powerful 30 Minute Grounding Energy Guided Meditation' and the description focusing on anchoring oneself in the present moment, fostering inner peace, and achieving mental clarity. The terms 'grounding,' 'calm and centered mind,' and 'mental clarity' strongly align with the Zen Flow vibe, warranting a high confidence score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Reboot Workout' is a suitable vibe as the meditation is described as a method to release stress, balance thoughts, and serve as a 'passport to anchoring yourself,' which suggests a complete refresh and total-body mental reset. This aligns with the Reboot Workout vibe of deep stretching or low-stress refreshment, assigned a score of 0.7.\n\nNo intense or physically demanding workout vibes (e.g., Warrior or Firestarter) are appropriate here, given the focus on meditation and relaxation rather than physical exertion."
