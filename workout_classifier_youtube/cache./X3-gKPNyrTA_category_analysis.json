  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Yoga' with a high score of 1.0, as both the title ('Yoga For Neck, Shoulders, Upper Back') and the description emphasize yoga practice. Tags such as 'yoga for neck pain,' 'yoga for shoulder pain,' and the channel's focus on yoga further support this category. The secondary category is 'Stretching,' with a score of 0.7 because the description and tags highlight relieving tension and increasing range of motion, typical aims of stretching routines. Although the channel is yoga-focused, the therapeutic nature and the mention of combating stiffness align with stretching. The high confidence level of 0.95 reflects the abundant clear indicators pointing to yoga, corroborated by tags, description, target audience feedback in comments, and the creator's expertise in yoga practice."
