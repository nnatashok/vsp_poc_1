  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (0.75) due to its continuous 45-minute routine that is designed to be completed without equipment or repetition, suggesting a smooth and fluid approach. The use of music from Epidemic Sound also indicates an emphasis on rhythm and pacing, enhancing the flow aspect. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also highly relevant (0.7) as the workout is structured into a 45-minute session with no repeat exercises, implying a methodical progression. The detailed warm-up routine shared in the comments further confirms an organized approach. Lastly, the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is considered (0.6) since the workout covers the full body, is designed to be super effective, and includes cardio components. Although described as not super intense, the breadth of muscle group coverage and the frequent user reports of soreness suggest a high level of exertion, supporting the inclusion of this spirit."
