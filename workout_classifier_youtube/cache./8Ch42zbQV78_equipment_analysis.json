  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title '15 Minute Stationary Bike Workout' explicitly indicates the use of a stationary bike. Additionally, the tags 'cycling workout' and 'cardio' further support the need for an exercise bike as cycling is a central component. The description that references a cardio workout also points towards the stationary bike as the primary equipment necessary. A top comment mentioning a warm-up and intervals strengthens the conclusion that the activity involves cycling, likely on a stationary bike. Given these clues from the title, tags, and user comments, there's a very high confidence (0.9) that an exercise bike is required for this workout."
