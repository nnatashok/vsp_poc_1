  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is designed to lower blood pressure through a low-impact, sustainable routine, aligning with 'The Comfort Moves' vibe (score: 0.75). This is supported by the focus on safe, repeatable exercises, as indicated by the phrases 'low impact' and 'safe to do multiple times throughout your day' in the description. The emphasis on gentle, consistent movement and positive health outcomes contributes to this classification.\n\n'\"The Reboot Workout' is also relevant (score: 0.65) as the workout offers a practical way to refresh one's body without stress. The description repeatedly links the exercise to positive health impacts and stress reduction, suggesting a rejuvenating and refreshing experience akin to a reboot or reset.\n\nLastly, 'The Meditative Grind' receives a moderate score (0.4) due to the repetitive, structured nature of this 10-minute exercise routine, which involves performing the same exercises in a sequence without programmed breaks. The goal of lowering blood pressure naturally hints at a calming, meditative aspect.\n\nOther vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded due to the absence of high intensity or explosive elements. The channel's focus on health and safety further supports these selected vibes. Overall, the confidence level is fairly high based on the provided metadata."
