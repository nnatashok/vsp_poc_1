    "Some people might not realize but this is not just a workout, it is also helping to get the right mindset for doing endurance sport. You can&#39;t push your heartrate to the limit for 60min if your mind doesn&#39;t embrace to get over your own limits.",
    "Finally got cleared after my C-section 8 weeks ago and I&#39;m so excited to be back doing your classes\ud83d\udc97 you&#39;re amazing, thank you for doing this and sharing these amazing workouts on YouTube for us at home\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97",
    "I play this various times every week. I don\u2019t do the movements but just the music and the motivation makes this enjoyable every time I play it \ud83d\ude0d",
    "This class &amp; instructor fill me with positive vibes &amp; chills! Love her energy!",
    "Bf just came asking \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just ride why do you gotta listen to a video\u201d cuz it helps I can\u2019t push myself and it feels good to see and hear a woman motivating us to get fit and healthy"
