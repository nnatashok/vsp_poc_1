    "I love your yoga flows and pilates classes (especially the longer ones), they make me feel so connected to my body and I feel the best at the end of every workout! Thank you so much Nicole \ud83e\udd0d",
    "Hello! Thank you so much for this. I have been training for a marathon, and use three of your sessions a week. They really change my routine for the better, and I can see a massive difference in my overall strength! Lots of love from Paris!",
    "This class should be mandatory in schools from childhood, so that children grow up elongated, with a flexible spine and develop into adults and the elderly with fewer back problems, stretched, with ease in their routine and happy, without pain. For me, the best classes are yours on the internet and I thank you for the delicacy and dedication in your videos. In addition to the kitten that always shows up to say hello, so cute. Congratulations and thank you!!",
    "I was struggling with depression for years and i can&#39;t explain how much your videos helped me fight with it and kept my mind at peace.It&#39;s been 2 years that im doing your exercises and i wanted to say  now i am mentally in a better place thanks to you \ud83d\udc9c"
