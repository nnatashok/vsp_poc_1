  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"Yoga To Feel Your Best | 22-Minute Home Yoga\" explicitly suggests the use of a mat. This inference is drawn from several sources within the metadata. The description directly invites viewers to \"hop on the mat,\" which is a strong indication that a mat is central to performing this yoga session effectively. Additionally, the comments, particularly the top one, emphasize stepping onto a mat as part of the practice. Given the context of yoga and the commonality of using mats for such exercises to ensure comfort, support, and safety, the confidence level is set at 0.9, indicating very high confidence in the necessity of a mat for this workout session."
