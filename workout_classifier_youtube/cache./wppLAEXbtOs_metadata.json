    "Never been happier to watch a mid-video advertisement all the way through.",
    "Thanks! I did this video at least five days a week for about five months and it was extremely helpful to me for losing over 75 pounds. My knee pain is now gone, I attribute that to all the squats in this video. What I thought would be lifelong shoulder pain is now very mild and it was very helpful and getting me to a point where I am now doing a 3000 push-up challenge in the month of May.",
    "A year ago I was doing these videos every day. At some point after losing 25lbs I stopped, and began maintaining weight through diet and walking daily. In the last year I\u2019ve fallen out of touch with my physical self. This week I picked these hiit routines back up and can already feel my physical and mental faculties reconnecting. Thank you!",
    "This was an amazing workout! Probably the most balanced HIIT I have ever done!<br><br>Good work putting this together!"
