  "spiritsExplanation": "The video title \"PCOS Home Workout for Weight Loss + Belly Fat\" suggests a structured approach, focusing on weight loss and specific body areas common in structured workouts, hence 'Structured & Disciplined' is assigned a high score of 0.7. Tags like \"pcos workout plan\" and phrases in the description such as \"step by step videos\" align with this classification. The exercises listed in the comments (e.g., squat holds, dumbbell flys) further indicate a methodical approach. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is considered due to potential pacing and coordination aspects in workout routines aimed at managing PCOS; however, evidence is less explicit, earning it a moderate score of 0.5. \n\n'Soothing & Restorative' receives a score of 0.4 because of the PCOS context aimed at managing symptoms gently, seen in comments about avoiding fatigue from intense workouts. The community emphasis on managing PCOS with lifestyle changes suggests a healing focus, though less explicit in the workout description. \n\nHigh-energy elements are downplayed due to avoidant comments on intense workouts, and an outdoor or adventurous aspect is not suggested by the video context and tags."
