  "title": "10 MIN PERFECT ABS WORKOUT (NO EQUIPMENT BODYWEIGHT WORKOUT!)",
  "description": "To develop a truly impressive Sixpack, you will want to train from abs a whole range of perspectives. You see, the core is generally made up of four key components. Namely - the rectus abdominus (6pack / lower abs), obliques, the serratus anterior, and the transverse abdominus (inner abs).\n\n\ud83d\udc49Coaching Programs: https://www.fraserwilsonfitness.com\n\nThe obliques are an absolute must when it comes to developing an aesthetic physique. If your goal is to attain the V tapered look, there\u2019s no way around training them. The obliques are a multifunctional muscle, they act to pull the chest downwards and compress the abdominal cavity, as well as performing side bending and opposing side rotation. Overall, you can\u2019t skimp on your obliques for aesthetic and performance, and the best way to ensure that you stay on track is to keep your workouts fresh & challenging\n\nThe serratus is a muscle that originates on your upper rib cage and attaches to the media border of the shoulder blade (basically the shark gill looking things). The serratus muscles play a pivotal role in framing out your abs, obliques and lower pec. Not too mention, it absolutely serves as an asset to the v taper, in turn giving you a better looking set of abs!\n\nThis video is full length which means you can just follow along with whatever I'm doing. If you need extra rest, just pause the video. If you don't need a rest - watch it the whole way through.\n\nYou can hit this home workout 2-3x per week - and if you wanted to keep active on your other days - be sure to check out my other workouts!\n\n\ud83d\udc49Coaching Programs: https://www.fraserwilsonfitness.com\n\ud83d\udc49Subscribe: (https://goo.gl/84uFTA)\n\ud83d\udcaaSupplement Code: FRASER10 at https://www.ehplabs.com/\n\ud83d\udc49Shop Gymshark: https://gym.sh/Shop-Fraser2\n\nADD ME ON:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/FraserWilsonFit/\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/FraserWilsonFit/\nSnapchat: FraserWilsonFit\n\nMusic:\nShip Wrek & Zookeepers - Ark [NCS Release]:\nhttps://youtu.be/8xlDwukxjnA\n\nHeuse & Zeus x Crona - Pill (feat.

    "Hey there! Yes, you, the person reading this rn, listen... i started doing ab workouts this summer. It took some time to make myself do it and start a routine cause i&#39;m lazy af and i just want to tell you that once you get past like the first week or two you kind of become addicted to it (in a good way) and it pushes you to do it almost every day. I also wanna add that my anxiety and mental health in general has gotten a lot better since i stared working out and i also figured out that i don&#39;t really focus on the way that my body looks but rather on the way that working out makes me feel and don&#39;t get me wrong, there definitelly are changes and i love that but the feeling of acutally doing something right for myself is what keeps me going... so yeah, get your lazy ass up and start working on yourself NOW! I hope that this motivated at least one person, have a great day and good luck!!",

    "I&#39;ve been doing this exact workout every day since the beginning of December. So it&#39;s been over half a year now. With relatively proper nutrition (nothing special) and no other strength training, I was able to get a pretty neat six pack.<br>Just wanted to share my story and remind you that it just needs a little bit of dedication and 10 minutes of your day to make a change in your life.<br>Stay healthy!",
