  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily Beginner, with a consideration for Intermediate due to the mental focus needed for breathwork if someone's new to the concept. The accessible nature of the breathwork aligns with an entry-level practice, as reinforced by the majority of comments referencing relaxation and emotional balance rather than physical exertion. The metadata suggests this session is suitable for newcomers, but those with some experience may appreciate the mental aspects of the practice, thus including Intermediate."
