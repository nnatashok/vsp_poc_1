  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves using dumbbells for full body exercises, suggesting movements like rows or lunges which require some coordination. The mention of 'advanced' in the title implies a focus on more challenging variations or combinations, but the common use of dumbbells generally involves intermediate technique rather than highly complex movements. Additional preview recommendation hints at the need for preparation but primarily focuses on weight selection rather than technique intricacies.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's 33-minute duration with back-to-back exercises and rest only between groups suggests significant energy expenditure. The focus on 'muscular endurance' generally implies multiple repetitions which can increase cardiovascular demand. While short rest could make the workout physically demanding, the option to adjust dumbbell weight allows for scalability, aligning it with both moderate and higher effort levels for different users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the intermediate-to-advanced technique and moderate-to-challenging effort level, the workout fits well for both intermediate and advanced users. Beginner participants may find it accessible with lower weights and adjustments, which aligns with some comments from older users. The ability to select and adapt dumbbell weights permits flexibility across different fitness levels, making it broadly accessible despite its 'advanced' label."
