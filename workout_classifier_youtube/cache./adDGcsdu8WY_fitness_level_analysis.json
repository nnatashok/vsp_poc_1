  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features a HIIT routine with no equipment, indicating movements that are generally straightforward but may include some coordination and balance, especially given the cardio focus. Tags like 'cardio workout for beginners' and 'workout at home' suggest accessibility, while 'full body hiit' could imply some complexity. Thus, it likely involves simple to moderately complex movements, suitable for beginners and intermediaries, with minimal prerequisites for advanced levels due to no equipment being used.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session duration is 20 minutes, with 45 seconds of activity and 15-second rests, suggesting a challenging intensity for less conditioned individuals. Claims of burning 300-400 calories support this being a demanding workout, aligning with a 'challenging' difficulty for those not regularly active but moderate for some users. The HIIT format inherently involves intensity and high effort, suitable for moderate to challenging levels, especially given the inferred energy expenditure.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is labeled suitable for beginners, with comments showing success from individuals new to exercise. The technique and effort difficulty align with both beginner and intermediate levels, given the accessible nature of bodyweight exercises. Additionally, the advanced level is included due to the potential intensity of the intervals, but the absence of complex movements makes it accessible for a broad range of fitness levels with some exercise experience."
