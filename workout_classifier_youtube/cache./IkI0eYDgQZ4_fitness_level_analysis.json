  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video includes a range of exercises from basic push-ups and pull-ups to more advanced movements like muscle-ups and handstand push-ups. The progression from simple to complex movements suggests a variety of technique difficulties. Beginner techniques are supported by exercises like push-ups, suitable for novices. Intermediate techniques are likely with exercises like pull-ups that require some coordination and strength. Advanced and expert techniques are suggested by the inclusion of muscle-ups and handstand push-ups, which require significant skill and practice.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "While the video's duration is relatively short at just over 10 minutes, the inclusion of calisthenic exercises such as muscle-ups and handstand push-ups suggests a high level of physical demand. These exercises typically require substantial muscle engagement and endurance, likely placing the overall effort difficulty at a challenging level for most people, and possibly extreme for the unprepared.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the range of exercises from basic to advanced, the required fitness level likely spans from intermediate to advanced. The technique difficulty range from beginner to expert along with the challenging effort level suggests that complete beginners may struggle, but with modifications or selective engagement (choosing simpler exercises), some beginner-level participation is feasible. However, intermediate to advanced users will find the session appropriately challenging, ensuring safe and effective participation across multiple fitness levels."
