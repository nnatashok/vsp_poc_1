    "You&#39;re the best instructor on YouTube, especially for beginners! You explain and show things so clearly, and everything feels doable. You&#39;re right when you say many beginner workouts on here are too hard. Thank you \ud83d\udc96.",
    "Thank you, Jessica.  I loved this beginner/refresher workout.  It&#39;s just what I needed.   I&#39;m thankful that my power was on this morning so I could enjoy seeing you and doing my Pilates this morning.   My thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the horrendous fires in Southern California.  \u2764",
    "My 74 year old body loved this basic Pilates class!\u2764\ufe0f",
    "I was feeling very stiff and achy this morning. This is just what I needed. Thank you for a true beginner level video.",
    "So happy to see another beginner workout posted when I went to exercise. I am getting back into my fitness routine and this is just what I needed to stretch out the soreness from my last session. Thank you Jessica!"
