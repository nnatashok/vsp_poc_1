  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is designed with no equipment, focusing on bodyweight movements which typically indicates less complex exercises. The inclusion of isometric holds suggests some need for body awareness and stability, aligning with intermediate level. The description explicitly mentions modifications for beginners and advanced users, but the focus on strength and stability likely demands decent form execution, fitting 'Beginner' and 'Intermediate' technique levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Being a 26-minute full body workout, it involves sustained physical activity contributing to moderate effort levels. The use of terms such as 'full body flow' and 'maximize strength and stability' suggests the workout is moderately demanding. Moreover, comments highlighting perspiration and the sense of accomplishment suggest it can be challenging for deconditioned users, hence classifying it as 'Moderate' and 'Challenging'.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout's technique difficulty is beginner to intermediate, but its length and user feedback suggest a more challenging element. The availability of modifications makes it accessible for beginners, while the full routine presents more intensity suitable for intermediates. The duration automatically elevates it slightly from the beginner bracket, and the content, supporting a recovery day for heavy lifters, adds mild alignment with advanced users. Thus, it's suitable for beginners through to intermediate, with potential challenge for slightly advanced users."
