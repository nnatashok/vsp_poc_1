  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as a 'Mat' exercise due to its focus on floor exercises performed at home without any equipment. The title and tags emphasize this with phrases such as '10 MIN DAILY ABS WORKOUT', 'no equipment', and 'at home abs workout'. The reference to the exercise mat in the description reinforces this choice, earning a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe category 'Body weight' is also relevant here because the workout relies solely on the individual's body mass for resistance, as indicated by the term 'no equipment abs'. This context within the description and tags clearly shows that no weights or machines are used, justifying a score of 0.8.\n\nOther categories such as 'Weight workout', 'Pilates', or 'Calisthenics' were excluded due to the primary focus on core mat exercises and the specific mention of no equipment use. This analysis results in high confidence classification as the evidence is strong and explicit."
