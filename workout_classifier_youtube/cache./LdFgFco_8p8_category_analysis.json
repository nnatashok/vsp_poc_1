  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is clearly categorized as a 'Weight workout' due to the explicit mention of using dumbbells for strength training, as seen in the title ('With Weights'), description ('Equipment: Dumbbells'), and tags ('hiit with weights', 'full body hiit with weights'). The strong emphasis on using weights supports a score of 0.9 for this category. Additionally, the 'HIIT' category is also applicable with a score of 0.8, as the tags include 'hiit workout', 'high intensity interval training', and 'full body hiit workout'. The description further supports this with the format of 50 seconds of exercise followed by 10 seconds of rest, typical of HIIT training. The high intensity and structured interval format contribute to this categorization. Both categories are highly relevant and supported by the metadata, leading to a confidence level of 0.9 for the overall categorization."
