  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily aims to be accessible for individuals with knee and lower body issues, indicating its low-impact and gentle nature. This aligns well with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, earning a score of 0.65, as it focuses on being a recovery-friendly and non-strenuous exercise option, supported by phrases like 'no jumping,' 'low impact,' and 'workout for knee problem' in both the description and tags. The use of a sequential, no-jumping design also indicates a degree of 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, with a score of 0.55, as it suggests a thoughtful progression to accommodate physical limitations, with detailed timecodes providing a clear framework. Additionally, there is evidence of 'Flow & Rhythm' through the smooth transition between exercises indicated by rest periods and rhythmic exercises such as 'Arm Crossovers' and 'Hip Swirls,' justifying a score of 0.4. The comments reflect positive outcomes and engagement, highlighting the workout's effectiveness and accessibility."
