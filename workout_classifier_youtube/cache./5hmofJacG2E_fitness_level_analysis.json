  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is an elliptical machine session, which generally involves low complexity movements since the machine guides motion. The key action is maintaining a steady pace, making it beginner-friendly. However, adjusting resistance and incline for intervals requires some user engagement, justifying a minor intermediate score for those less familiar with elliptical settings.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Technique difficulty leans towards beginner due to the guided nature of elliptical workouts, though some familiarity with settings may be beneficial (scoring a minor intermediate). Effort difficulty is moderate with potential for increased challenge, suggesting fit beginners and early intermediates can benefit. The 30-minute duration places some demands, pushing the requirement slightly beyond complete novices."
