  "spiritsExplanation": "The dominant spirit for this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.95. This conclusion is strongly supported by the video's focus on meditation, relaxations techniques such as affirmations and visualization, as indicated in the description and channel information. The caution against listening while driving underscores its emphasis on relaxation. Alunir Meditations specializes in meditations aimed at relaxation and manifestation, further confirming this classification.\n\nThe secondary spirit identified is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a moderate score of 0.4. This is less confident but considered due to the structured nature of guided meditation, which often follows a rhythm or flow, particularly with the use of audio cues and counting mentioned in the comments. However, the focus on relaxation outweighs the rhythmic elements.\n\nNo indicators support other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility.' The content is primarily focused on meditative and soothing goals, not physical exertion or technique."
