  "categoriesConfidence": 0.95,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category 'Meditation' was chosen with high confidence due to the video title 'Meditation for Anxiety - Yoga With Adriene,' the description's mention of a 'simple at home meditation' for 'relief from anxiety, stress, and energetic imbalance,' and tags like 'meditation,' '15 min meditation,' and 'meditation for beginners.' These indicators highlight meditation as the central focus, justifying a 0.9 score. 'Yoga' is also highly relevant since the channel 'Yoga With Adriene' focuses on yoga, and the description encourages finding a 'comfortable seat, tune into your breath,' which suggests a meditative yoga practice. This aligns with tags 'yoga,' 'yoga for stress relief,' warranting a score of 0.8. Additionally, 'Breathing exercises' is implicated due to the encouragement to 'tune into your breath,' and tags like 'breathing techniques,' thus scoring 0.7. The emphasis on spiritual and mental well-being, as reflected in comments and tags, further supports these categories, with less relevance to other fitness-focused categories."
