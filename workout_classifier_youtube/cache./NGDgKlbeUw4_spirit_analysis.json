  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout incorporates elements of 'Flow & Rhythm' with its focus on smooth, continuous movement patterns in a Pilates class format, as indicated by terms like \"athletic cardio flows,\" \"cardio pilates,\" and Nicole's background in dance, fostering a mind-body connection. This spirit is given a score of 0.75 for the seamless integration of rhythm with exercise. 'High-Energy & Intense' is also relevant, suggested by the description's emphasis on \"increase your heart rate for a fun and sweaty session!\" and user comments like \"cardio burst\" and \"butt kicked in a calm way,\" highlighting its energetic and intensity components, thus scoring a 0.7. Finally, there is a touch of 'Structured & Disciplined' due to the methodical nature of Pilates, further evidenced by a user who appreciated the \"very specific directions,\" and Nicole's professional background adds a structured layer, justifying a score of 0.6. Other potential spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded due to the cardio and intensity focus."
