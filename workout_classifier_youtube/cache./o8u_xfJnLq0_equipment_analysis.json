  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled '20 MIN hourglass full body pilates workout // no equipment // beginner friendly', which explicitly states that no equipment is required. The description does not mention any equipment either and emphasizes that it is a full-body routine accessible to beginners. Additionally, as a Pilates workout led by a Level 3 Pilates mat instructor, it is likely to rely on bodyweight exercises that focus on controlled movements rather than relying on equipment. The top comments support this, noting accessibility and results without mentioning any equipment use. As such, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, aligning with the 'no equipment' in the title."
