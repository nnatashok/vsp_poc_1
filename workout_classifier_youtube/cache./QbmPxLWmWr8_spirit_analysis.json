  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'High-Energy & Intense,' supported by the description of the session as a 'super sweaty' and 'full body cardio workout.' This is echoed by the user comments emphasizing its intense nature, with phrases like 'breathless and very tired.' The repetition of terms like 'intense cardio' in the tags strongly affirms this spirit, earning it a high score of 0.9. The mention of 'No Jumping' and 'apartment friendly' further supports its intensity while ensuring it's accessible for home environments. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is moderately present as there's an implied element of flow due to the lack of equipment, and continuous movement ('no repeats') which suggests a coordinated, smooth sequence of exercises. The user comment mentioning improvements in coordination implies some rhythmic components, giving it a moderate score of 0.5. Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the emphasis on intensity and being home-based."
