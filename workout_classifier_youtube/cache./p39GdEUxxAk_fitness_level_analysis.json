  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the technique and effort difficulties, the required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner', as the workout consists of simple, gentle movements suitable for those new to yoga or with minimal fitness experience. The presence of multiple options for practicing these movements (like slight modifications or deeper stretches, as might be inferred in general yoga practice) allows for a secondary inclusion of 'Intermediate' level, albeit with lower certainty, to cover slightly more experienced individuals looking for easy wellness routines. User comments noting improved comfort and minimal time commitment further support broad accessibility."
