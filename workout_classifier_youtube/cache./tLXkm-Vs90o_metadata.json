    "It\u2019s crazy how just a little bit of breath work can go such a long way",
    "I basically rely on this practice every morning to survive the day as a kindergarten teacher with calm and present energy. Every single morning for a year now",
    "I do your sleep breathwork, your morning breathwork, your anxiety breathwork, and several other videos. Thank you for this. Thank you for not making it &quot;spiritual&quot; and allowing it to just be about the skill of breathwork.",
    "The best book I ever read was a breathwork guide with a difference. I discovered my true self, found inner peace and with this inside of me I found the strength to carry on after the death of my little boy. Truly amazing book. The Full Breath by James Francis.",
    "Every morning you say &quot; consider that you&#39;re grateful for&quot; I always say you, for this practice and your company \u2764"
