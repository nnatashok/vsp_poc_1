  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is strongly aligned with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as indicated by the 'slow pace' mentioned in the title and the description focusing on a \"gentle guidance\" suitable for beginners. The comments reflect experiences of healing and mental calmness, reinforcing this classification. The format's emphasis on a safe, gradual approach, along with restorative benefits like reduced anxiety and better breathing capabilities, align perfectly with this spirit, resulting in a score of 1.0.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant; the exercise promotes continuous breathing cycles, guided by an audiovisual 'Breathing Bubble' to maintain rhythm and pace. The entrancing background sounds mentioned in the description further suggest a rhythmic element to the practice, justifying a 0.7 score.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is evident through methodical guidance in \"building up to 90 seconds breath hold\" and the gradual increase in practice without force. This intentional, progressive approach earns a score of 0.6. The absence of intense physical exertion excludes 'High-Energy & Intense.' Similarly, lack of sports-specific elements and environmental interaction rules out 'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure.'"
