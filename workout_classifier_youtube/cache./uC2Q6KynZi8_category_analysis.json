  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is categorized primarily as \"Yoga\" with a score of 1.0 due to multiple explicit references to yoga in the title, description, and tags. The title \"20 min Beginner Flow for Strength & Flexibility\" and the description mentioning a \"beginner vinyasa flow yoga class\" clearly indicate a yoga session. The channel's name, \"Yoga with Kassandra,\" and its focus on Vinyasa & Yin Yoga further reinforce this classification. The tags include multiple mentions of yoga, such as \"beginner yoga,\" \"yoga for strength and flexibility,\" and \"yoga poses for beginners.\"\n\nAn additional category of \"Stretching\" is assigned a score of 0.6 because the workout aims to improve flexibility, as indicated in the title and the description mentioning \"a really good stretch in your hips and hamstrings.\" The user comments also reflect improvements in flexibility as a beneficial outcome of these classes. However, the primary focus remains on yoga, thus the lower score for Stretching."
