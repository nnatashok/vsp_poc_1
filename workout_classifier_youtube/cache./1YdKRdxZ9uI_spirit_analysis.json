  "spiritsExplanation": "The video titled \"Grounding Yourself into Positive Energy (15 Minute Guided Meditation)\" clearly aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The primary indications for this classification come from the use of terms such as \"guided meditation,\" \"grounding,\" and \"positive energy\" in the title and tags, which suggest a focus on calming and healing. The description emphasizes producing a peaceful state through meditation, indicating restorative goals. Comments from viewers express feelings of calm, healing, and renewal, substantiating the video's impact as a restorative practice (e.g., \"quiet and calm within,\" \"help me feel grounded\"). The channel, \"Great Meditation,\" consistently focuses on meditation and peaceful state transformation, reinforcing the focus on recovery and stress reduction. Given the strong thematic focus on healing and calm, a score of 0.9 is warranted. Alternative spirits are unlikely due to the lack of high-intensity, structured, or athletic elements in both the metadata and viewer feedback, with explicit emphasis on rest and recovery."
