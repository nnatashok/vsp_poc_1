  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the 'Beginner' technique difficulty and 'Light' effort difficulty, the required fitness level is also 'Beginner'. The meditation is accessible to everyone regardless of physical fitness, and the practice focuses on mindfulness and stress reduction rather than physical activity. The session is 21 minutes long, but since it's non-physical, the duration does not affect accessibility."
