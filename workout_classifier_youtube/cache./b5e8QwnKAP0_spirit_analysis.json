  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video, titled 'Guided 100 Push Up Workout!', suggests a focus on strength and endurance through a high volume of push-ups, which typically associates with a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. This is further supported by the description emphasizing physical strength and comments noting the intensity and challenge, such as 'toughest pushups' and references to 'clapping push-ups', indicating a strong effort-oriented session. Consequently, this spirit scores 0.85 due to these elements.\n\nAdditionally, the workout provides structured guidance through varied push-up styles ('Standard/Basic', 'Wide', and clapping push-ups are mentioned in comments), suggesting a 'Structured & Disciplined' approach with incremental difficulty and technique focus, thus justifying a 0.7 score for this spirit. Comments also mention how the workout is broken down to be easier to follow, which aligns with this disciplined structure. \n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are less applicable due to the workout's intensity and lack of emphasis on fluid movement or relaxation."
