  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves walking on a treadmill with varied speed and incline, which is straightforward with minimal complexity. The primary movement is walking, which is a basic, low-technique activity. The inclusion of speed and incline adjustments may require minor skill but does not elevate the overall technique difficulty significantly beyond the beginner level. Hence, the primary classification is 'Beginner' with a minor 'Intermediate' score for those unfamiliar with treadmill settings.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's effort difficulty is mainly 'Light' due to its foundation in walking, a low-intensity activity suitable for deconditioned individuals. The 33-minute duration and use of incline and speed adjustments can moderately increase energy expenditure, supporting a 'Moderate' classification. Therefore, it fits both 'Light' and 'Moderate' categories.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "With a 'Beginner' technique difficulty and a mixture of 'Light' to 'Moderate' effort difficulty, the workout suits 'Beginner' fitness levels effectively. The presence of adjustable speed and incline, alongside a nearly 34-minute duration, suggests it can also engage 'Intermediate' users by offering a slightly more demanding session. The platform's inclusive fitness philosophy and user feedback on its accessibility support these classifications."
