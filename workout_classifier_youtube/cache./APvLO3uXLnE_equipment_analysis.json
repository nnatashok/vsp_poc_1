  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '15 MIN Guided Meditation For Manifestation & Success | Feed Your Truth & Inner Fire' does not require any physical equipment. The metadata, including the title, description, and tags, consistently emphasizes meditation practice without mentioning any physical exercises or equipment. Guided meditation typically involves sitting or lying comfortably in a quiet space, which can be done without specific equipment, as implied by references to finding stillness and focusing on mental calmness and success manifestation. The comments further reinforce the focus on the mental and spiritual benefits of meditation, with no mention of physical tools. Thus, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, utilizing mindfulness and mental focus without additional equipment."
