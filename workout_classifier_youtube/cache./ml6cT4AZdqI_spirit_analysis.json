  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout video is 'High-Energy & Intense,' with a score of 0.95. This is supported by the title mentioning 'HIIT' (High-Intensity Interval Training) and 'cardio,' which inherently suggest a fast-paced, heart-pumping workout designed to maximize effort. The description emphasizes activities like 'high-knees,' 'fast feet,' and 'star jumps,' known for spiking heart rates, fitting the 'High-Energy & Intense' categorization perfectly.\n\nThe secondary spirit 'Structured & Disciplined' is present at a moderate level with a score of 0.65. This classification is justified as the workout follows a '30-Minute' structure and includes a 'warm up,' indicating a methodical approach with a clear progression in intensity. The workout is led by a trainer, suggesting a disciplined routine.\n\nAlternative spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were deemed inappropriate due to the focus on intensity rather than fluid movement or relaxation. Likewise, 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Sport & Agility' were not relevant as the workout is home-based and primarily cardiovascular rather than athletic or exploratory."
