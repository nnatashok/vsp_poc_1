  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified with high confidence primarily under 'The Zen Flow,' with a strong emphasis on grounding and intentional breath-centered practice. The title, '4-7-8 Calm Breathing Exercise | 15 Minutes of Deep Relaxation', along with the description, highlights calming, slow breathing, deeply rooted in relaxation and stress relief, synonymous with 'Zen Flow'. The use of terms like 'calm your sympathetic nervous system' and 'relieve anxiety' further aligns with this vibe. \n\n'\"The Deep Recharge' is also a pertinent vibe, given the focus on nervous system resetting through controlled breathing, which is intended to combat anxiety, indicative of deep nervous system relaxation (score: 0.8).\n\nFurthermore, 'The Sleep Prep' vibe is relevant due to the description noting the exercise's ability to help users 'fall asleep' and the video's promotion of a calming atmosphere conducive to winding down before rest (score: 0.7).\n\nAlternate vibes considered included 'The Meditative Grind' due to the repetitive nature of the breathing pattern, but the emphasis is more on calming and less on endurance or focus, hence it was not applicable."
