  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes a variety of movements such as lateral taps, plies, lunges, stretches, and basic yoga poses that range from beginner to intermediate in complexity. These exercises require some coordination and balance but are generally accessible. The instructor is known for clear guidance, which supports technique learning. The mention of 'barefoot' suggests simplified movements, while the inclusion of poses like Plank and Twisted Chair indicates some complexity. Hence, it is mostly intermediate but accessible to beginners with modifications.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 34:46 minutes long, which tends to increase effort difficulty for less conditioned users. The description mentions maintaining a raised heart rate and working up a sweat, indicating moderate intensity. Comments from users about sweating and needing breaks suggest that it's moderately challenging. Although termed 'moderate,' the duration and consistent movement likely push the effort towards challenging for beginners.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Despite the workout's classification as suitable for 'all levels,' the 34-minute duration and some intermediate exercises suggest it requires at least an intermediate level for full completion. However, the workout's 'low impact' nature allows beginners to attempt it with modifications or breaks, hence a beginner level is included with lower weight. The comments from users provide real-world insight that it challenges even those in intermediate stages, suggesting a reasonable alignment across beginner to advanced levels."
