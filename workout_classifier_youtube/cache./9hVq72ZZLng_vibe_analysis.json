  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is best classified as 'The Foundation Builder' due to its focus on fundamental bodyweight movements designed for strength and coordination improvement. The description explicitly mentions mastering staple movements and practicing control, which is indicative of building a strong foundation, justifying the high score of 0.9.\n\nIt also aligns with 'The Progression Quest' vibe as it is part of a beginner series intended to prepare participants for the full EPIC Program, emphasizing progression and long-term improvement. The details in the description about moving to advanced versions and the structured 30-minute format support this vibe, warranting a score of 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Masterclass Workout' is relevant due to its technique-driven nature, with exercises like Cobra Push Ups that focus on mind-muscle connection and control, which are skill-building elements. However, this is less dominant and receives a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nThe metadata lacks elements of intense energy, gamification, or full-body dynamic movement, which is why other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Endorphin Wave' were not considered. There is high confidence in this vibe classification due to the clear language and structure provided in the video description and user comments."
