  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily targeted at kids and focuses on strength training exercises designed to be accessible to children. The exercises are likely simple and foundational, such as basic bodyweight movements like squats, push-ups, or planks that don't require advanced coordination or technique. The emphasis is on fun and engagement, which aligns with beginner-level technique difficulty. Intermediate inclusion considers that some exercises may require correct posture or slight coordination adjustments typically present in slightly more complex kids' workouts.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given the workout is only 11 minutes long and explicitly targeted towards kids, the overall physical demand is likely low. It likely includes short bursts of activity suitable for children with breaks that accommodate young fitness levels. The descriptors \"get strong\" and \"go faster\" suggest some dynamic elements, which might require moderate exertion at times, thereby contributing to a light to moderate effort rating. However, the primary target audience and short duration strongly indicate a more light exertion overall.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The beginner fitness level is the primary target for this workout, made evident by its intended audience (children) and simplified exercise structure. However, the intermediate level is considered as some exercises might be physically moderate for children or deconditioned adults, and could slightly challenge a beginner who requires more engagement or technique awareness. The workout's short duration and child-friendly design affirm its accessibility to beginners while a component of moderate difficulty suggests some minor applicability for intermediate users."
