  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a yoga flow labeled as suitable for 'all levels,' which typically suggests accessible movements. The description mentions hip openers, backbends, and standing balances. Basic versions of these moves require minimal technique, aligning well with beginner levels. The mention of providing 'options for more difficult positions' indicates the presence of more complex variations, which supports an intermediate technique level as well. Charlie Follows' instructional experience and registration suggest a focus on clear, accessible guidance.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 22 minutes long, featuring a steady vinyasa flow which involves continuous movement but not necessarily at a high intensity, which suggests a moderate effort difficulty. The inclusion of backbends and standing balances increases the physical demand slightly, especially for deconditioned users, warranting a challenging rating as well. User testimonials indicating calming and emotionally impactful experiences, with no emphasis on physical exhaustion, hint at moderate exertion in general, but some effort for those who haven't exercised recently.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "This yoga flow is designed for all levels, as highlighted in the title and description. The technique involves basic to intermediate yoga poses with different difficulty options, making it suitable for beginners with room for growth. The moderate to challenging effort level fits both beginners and intermediates. The Advanced level inclusion is due to the video\u2019s duration of over 20 minutes and integration of standing poses and backbends, which may pose a challenge for less experienced practitioners and provide sufficient engagement for more advanced users."
