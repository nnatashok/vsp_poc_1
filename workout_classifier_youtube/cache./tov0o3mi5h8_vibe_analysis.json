  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Masterclass Workout' due to its focus on teaching proper technique and foundational moves in Pilates, as evidenced by phrases like 'Pilates Workout for Beginners' and 'Pilates Class'. The emphasis on learning and skill-building for beginners supports this classification, with a score of 0.76 reflecting the strong alignment with technique-driven workouts.\n\n'Foundation Builder' is also applicable, scoring 0.65, as the workout aims to develop core strength and balance foundational to Pilates and functional fitness, noted in both channel and video descriptions about creating a connection to the body through movement.\n\nThe absence of music, highlighted in user comments, indicates a focus on technique over vibe-driven elements, ruling out options like 'The Nightclub Workout' or 'The Groove Session'. The channel's general emphasis on body awareness also supports the selection of these vibes."
