    "Honestly recommend this to anyone suffering from anxiety. Sometimes all we really need is a self-loving practice like this to relieve us from all the stress and tensions we feel in our body. Thank you so much for this!",
    "Honestly i wasn&#39;t having a good day, i was feeling so stressed so sad so angry so bored so tired but still trying to relax and to tell myself everything is gonna be fine.
