  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is largely beginner, as the core exercise involves controlled nose breathing while sitting or lying down, which requires minimal coordination. However, due to the rhythmic patterns and the inclusion of holds, intermediate coordination in pacing may be necessary, justifying the inclusion of an intermediate score. The breathing patterns, while simple, do require focus and control to achieve the desired outcomes, which can challenge some beginners. Based on the metadata, the main requirement is maintaining breath rhythm and holds, placing this between beginner and intermediate technique levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This breathing exercise is primarily light in terms of physical exertion, as it involves lying or sitting and focusing on breath. The effort comes from sustaining longer breath cycles and potential holds, which may elevate it to a moderate level for individuals not accustomed to breath control exercises. User comments, including effects on blood pressure and feelings of calm, suggest that while the activity is calming, the focus required can be somewhat demanding in a controlled way. Overall, it leans more towards light effort but requires sustained focus, which may feel moderately taxing for some.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.87,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is accessible to beginners, given its minimal physical exertion requirements, and the guidance provided throughout. However, the intermediate level is also included as some experience in focused breathing exercises would enhance the benefits extracted from this routine, especially given the emphasis on rhythmic breathing and breath holds. The inclusion of meditation and advanced breath patterns demands more conscious control, making it suitable for more than just absolute beginners. Viewer comments from a diverse age range, including those in their 80s, suggest accessibility across fitness levels, although it might feel challenging to maintain the routine for nearly 30 minutes for absolute beginners."
