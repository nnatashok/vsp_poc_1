  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified as 'Indoor biking' with very high confidence due to explicit and consistent references to indoor cycling and spinning throughout the video metadata. The title 'Beginner Hip Hop Indoor Cycling Class' clearly indicates an indoor cycling session. Tags such as 'spin class,' 'indoor cycling,' 'cycling workout,' and 'exercise bike workout' further reinforce this classification, showing a strong focus on cycling activities. The detailed workout breakdown in the description, which includes phases like 'ROLLING HILLS,' 'JUMPS,' 'CLIMBS,' and 'SPRINTS,' all correspond to typical exercises done on stationary bikes during cycling workouts. The channel's focus, 'Kaleigh Cohen Cycling,' aligns with providing cycle training content. A small score of 0.1 for 'Other' is added to account for any additional unspecified workout elements, but the overwhelming evidence supports 'Indoor biking' as the primary category."
