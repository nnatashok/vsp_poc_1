  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves the use of 10lb dumbbells with a focus on full-body exercises. The exercises themselves are likely to be basic strength moves since no complex or highly technical movements are mentioned in the metadata. However, using weights introduces some complexity, as proper form is necessary to prevent injury, placing this workout at the higher end of beginner or lower end of intermediate territory. 'Modifications included' and 'no jumping' further suggest ease of entry for various levels, supporting classification as beginner to intermediate technique difficulty. The advanced score is low due to the absence of complex movements or particularly high demands on balance or coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a 20-minute duration and structure of 45 seconds of activity followed by 15 seconds of rest, the workout demands a moderate level of physical effort. The use of dumbbells and continuous work with short rest periods suggests a moderate-to-challenging intensity. The low-impact designation ('no jumping'), however, keeps the overall energy expenditure from reaching an extreme level. User comments highlight muscle fatigue and effectiveness, aligning with the moderate to challenging effort classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is derived from both the technique and effort difficulty assessments. The presence of dumbbells allows users to adjust the weight according to their abilities, making the workout accessible to a range of fitness levels from beginner to advanced. The duration and intensity of the workout, indicated as moderate to challenging effort, support a broader fitness level range. Additionally, modifications and the inclusion of warm-up and cool down make it approachable for beginners. The comments reflect users of varying experiences benefiting from the workout, indicating widespread appropriateness."
