  "spiritsExplanation": "The video titled \"10 Minute Lower Body Stretch Routine (For Tight Hamstrings & Hip Flexors)\" is clearly focused on gentle stretching and recovery, which aligns strongly with the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit. The description mentions addressing muscle tension and pain relief from prolonged sitting, which is indicative of a restorative practice. Tags like \"lower body mobility exercises\", \"stretching for tight hamstrings\", and \"joint and back pain\" further support this classification, emphasizing aspects of relaxation and healing. User comments also suggest this workout helps with flexibility and is simple and steady, which are traits of a soothing session. The score of 0.85 reflects a strong alignment with restorative benefits, with almost no implication of the other spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Structured & Disciplined\" as the session does not focus on high intensity or strict protocols."
