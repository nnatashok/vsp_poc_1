  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected for this workout video is 'Mat' with a score of 0.8. Evidence from the video title, tags, and description consistently mentions exercises done \"in bed,\" suggesting exercises performed while lying down or sitting, similar to movements on an exercise mat. The emphasis on low-impact exercises in a bed context aligns closely with the 'Mat' category, particularly given that no equipment is used.\n\nThe secondary category assigned is 'Body weight' with a score of 0.7. The channel description and the nature of the exercises ('easy exercises to do in bed') indicate the use of body weight for resistance and fat burning, without any additional equipment, fitting well under this classification.\n\nWhile the video aims at fat reduction, the absence of any specific hint towards higher-intensity activities or distinct exercise modalities like 'HIIT', 'Pilates', or 'Yoga' excludes other categories. The context and user comments reinforce the experience as gentle and suitable for all, supporting the chosen categories."
