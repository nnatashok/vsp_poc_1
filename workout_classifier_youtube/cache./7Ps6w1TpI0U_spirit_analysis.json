  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'Flow & Rhythm' due to its focus on Pilates, which inherently emphasizes smooth, continuous movements and a strong mind-body connection. The title and tags repeatedly highlight 'Pilates' and 'full body,' suggesting a coordinated, holistic approach typical of this spirit. Music credits in the description reinforce this classification, indicating that the session is likely paced by background music.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' receives a score of 0.8 due to these clear indicators and the channel's background in dance, further supporting this connection.\n\nThe workout was also classified under 'Structured & Disciplined' because Pilates is a methodical exercise form that involves progressive training and technical precision, indicated by the detailed guidance likely provided by the instructor (as inferred from the channel's background and top comments). This spirit receives a score of 0.6 due to the strong indications of structured form and technique but less explicit emphasis than on flow.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are not applicable here, as Pilates generally focuses neither on high-intensity nor solely on relaxation."
