  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features compound movements such as high squats, lunges, Romanian deadlifts, and sumo deadlift squats, which require some coordination, balance, and proper form to execute correctly. The description emphasizes full range of motion and form cues, such as keeping the shoulder blades together during deadlifts. The presence of single-arm and alternating exercises further increase the complexity, justifying the higher score for technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is increased due to the 36-minute duration and the structure of 30-second sets with equal rest periods. The suggested use of heavy dumbbells (15kg each) adds a significant strength component. Comments suggest repeated use of the workout and weight loss outcomes, indicating a relatively high energy expenditure. Thus, despite the moderate pace, the overall effort is challenging, particularly for less fit users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the workout's 36-minute duration and the compound, weighted exercises, this routine is best suited for users with at least some fitness background, but it remains accessible to beginners looking to challenge themselves due to the option to adjust the weight and repetitions. The provided pointers in the description and comments about user improvements suggest it's manageable for beginners with modifications and also well-suited for intermediate or advanced users."
