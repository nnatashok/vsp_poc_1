  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a yoga session titled 'Feel Incredible in 10 Minutes - Morning Yoga Stretch at Home Routine', which strongly implies the use of a mat as it is typical for yoga practices. The description explicitly states 'No equipment needed\u2014just you, your mat...', confirming that a mat is required for comfort and effective execution of the exercises. Therefore, a yoga mat is needed with very high confidence. No other equipment is mentioned or implied throughout the metadata, including tags, description, and comments, suggesting that the workout is primarily bodyweight-focused and requires only a mat."
