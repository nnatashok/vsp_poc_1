  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a score of 0.85, suggested by the continuous, smooth nature of Pilates and the emphasis on movement and breath connection mentioned in the description. The terms 'express' and 'connect with your body and breath' highlight a flowing, music-driven pacing inherent in Pilates routines.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also significant, with a score of 0.7. This is evidenced by the 'moderate to intermediate' level indicating a methodical approach to exercise. The channel's focus on Pilates, a discipline known for its technical precision, further supports this classification.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit receives a score of 0.6, as noted in comments praising the inclusive positive and uplifting nature of the workout, which leaves participants feeling relaxed and recharged. However, intensity suggests it's not the main focus compared to the other spirits. Other potential spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were not applicable due to lack of indicators related to exercise intensity or outdoor elements."
