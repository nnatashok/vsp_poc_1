  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily focused on calisthenics exercises without any equipment, as indicated by the title 'How To Start Calisthenics at Home for Beginners (No Equipment).' The tags and description reinforce this focus, repeatedly mentioning 'calisthenics,' 'for beginners,' and 'no equipment,' suggesting a strong association with the calisthenics category (score: 0.9). The description and tags also emphasize bodyweight exercises ('bodyweight home workout'), aligning with the Body weight category, as calisthenics inherently involves exercises using one's body weight as resistance (score: 0.7). Given that the channel is dedicated to promoting calisthenics as a form of exercise accessible without equipment, the channel context further supports these classifications. The other categories do not fit because the video's central theme is calisthenics, particularly with no equipment, excluding other potential equipment-based or non-strength training categories."
