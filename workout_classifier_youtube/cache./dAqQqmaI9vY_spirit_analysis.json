  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative', supported by the focus on yoga asanas, pranayama, and the calming effects described in the description and comments. Evidence for this spirit includes phrases like 'making your body healthy and mind calm', 'calms the mind', and 'stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, anger issues' which indicate a healing and relaxing focus. The score of 0.8 indicates high confidence due to multiple sections within the routine dedicated to pranayama and relaxation techniques.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm', with a score of 0.6, due to the continuous execution of yoga poses and breathing exercises that promote a rhythmical flow of movements, such as the 'Suryanamaskar', 'alternate nostril breathing', and the structured sequence of practices listed in the timestamps. The channel's emphasis on 'learning the divine practice of Yoga' aligns with promoting a harmonious connection between mind and body, supporting this spirit.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to the video's clear focus on beginners' yoga and the absence of high-intensity, disciplined structure, or outdoor context-focused elements."
