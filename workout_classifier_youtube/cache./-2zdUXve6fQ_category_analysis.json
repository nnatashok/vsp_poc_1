  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is clearly a guided meditation session as indicated by the title '20 Minute Mindfulness Meditation for Being Present | Mindful Movement' and strongly supported by tags like 'meditation,' 'mindfulness meditation,' 'guided meditation,' and 'meditation for anxiety.' The description elaborates that it is a guided session designed to help listeners become mindful and present, which aligns directly with meditation practices. The channel, The Mindful Movement, is known for providing meditation content among other mindful practices, as their channel description emphasizes. User comments further affirm the impact and purpose of meditation, discussing personal experiences and the calming benefits it provided. No evidence suggests categorization into Yoga, Breathing exercises, or other categories, as the focus is entirely on guided meditation."
