  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a yoga session, as indicated by both the title 'Yoga To Reduce Stress | 30 Min Slow Flow - Relaxing Stretches + Savasana' and the description that mentions a sequence of yoga poses such as 'child's pose to cobra,' 'locust pose,' 'downward dog,' and 'savasana.' The description directly ends with 'See you on the mat \ud83d\ude0a,' further emphasizing the use of a yoga mat. Additionally, the video description includes a recommendation and discount code for a 'Yoga Mat: Liforme,' under the favorites section, confirming that a mat is essential for performing the workout. Given these multiple indicators, the confidence level for requiring a mat is very high at 1.0."
