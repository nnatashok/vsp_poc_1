  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated as Beginner to Intermediate. The workout consists of basic dumbbell exercises targeting the upper body, which are generally straightforward to perform. The description indicates it is designed for beginners and seniors, suggesting simplicity. However, the use of dumbbells and targeting different muscle groups adds a slight layer of complexity, hence a partial Intermediate rating is included.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as having Moderate effort difficulty. With a duration of 10 minutes, the workout targets multiple muscle groups (arms, back, chest) and is described as a 'slimming & fat burn' routine. The intensity is designed for weight loss and toning, which suggests moderate energy expenditure. Some users may find it slightly challenging, especially those with low physical activity levels, hence a slight inclusion of Challenging difficulty. Repeating the workout is mentioned as increasing the effort to a gym-like session, but for a single run-through, the intensity remains moderate.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is rated from Beginner to Advanced. It is clearly beginner-friendly, as stated in the description. The channel's focus on older adults and inclusive workouts supports accessibility for those new to exercise. However, the incorporation of dumbbells allows more experienced users to increase difficulty, aligning with Intermediate and even Advanced levels if heavier weights are used. The metadata emphasizes the workout\u2019s accessibility, but the possibility for increased intensity through weight modification and multiple repetitions suggests a broader fitness level applicability."
