  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 20-minute stretching routine, typically implying a low physical intensity compared to more dynamic or strength-based workouts. While stretching requires some effort, it is predominantly at a light level, particularly when targeted at beginners and intermediates. However, a moderate effort score is considered due to its length (20 minutes) and potential for some challenging flexibility demands for less fit users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given that the workout is a 20-minute stretching routine aimed at both beginners and intermediates, the required fitness level includes both groups with a high confidence score. The length of the video suggests some endurance capability might be needed, hence the inclusion of intermediate level. Advanced level is also considered, albeit with a lower score, to account for users seeking improved flexibility or deeper stretching challenges, as indicated by intermediates being a target audience in the metadata."
