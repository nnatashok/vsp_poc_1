  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title and description explicitly mention \"no equipment\" and \"beginner friendly,\" suggesting that the workout relies on bodyweight exercises only. The top comments and channel information do not provide any conflicting data or hint at the need for equipment, supporting a bodyweight-only conclusion. Additionally, as a certified Pilates instructor, the creator may emphasize floor-based exercises typical of Pilates that do not require equipment, aligning with the title's statement of \"full body hourglass pilates workout.\" Therefore, it is highly confident this workout requires no equipment."
