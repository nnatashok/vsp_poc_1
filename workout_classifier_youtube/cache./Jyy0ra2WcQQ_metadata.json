I am worthy of living. I am worthy of better. I am worthy of peace.",

    "It\u2019s really hard for me to meditate because of PTSD. I really want to meditate. I just listened to this and oh my god. When you counted down to 0... I swear, something came over me. I was filled with light and laughter and felt so relaxed. I have tried so many times to meditate and I have not been successful until this video. Wow. Thank you. <br><br>Also- for anyone who struggles staying calm for this long. After I was in this peaceful state for about one minute, I started to freak out for a second. And I just told myself \u201cI deserve peace. I deserve calm. It is okay to be happy. It is safe in peace. I am safe in peace. There is nothing to worry about here.\u201d And that really helped me get back into meditation. Maybe that will help someone else !"
