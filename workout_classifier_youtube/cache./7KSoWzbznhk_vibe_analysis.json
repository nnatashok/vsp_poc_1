  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe, 'The Reboot Workout', is exceptionally suitable given the significant emphasis on stretching and cooling down, making it a full-body refresh routine. Evidence from the title ('FULL BODY STRETCH & COOL DOWN ROUTINE') and description ('A quick and simple beginner flexibility routine') strongly indicates light, restorative activities typical of this vibe, earning a high score of 0.95. Additionally, 'The Zen Flow' vibe is relevant due to the focus on slow, intentional movement and flexibility, but is less prominent, as the workout is described primarily as a stretch rather than breath-centered or flowing, which I rated a 0.7. Lastly, 'The Comfort Moves' vibe fits moderately because it is accessible and beginner-friendly, but lacks the specific 'cozy' focus, scoring a 0.5. These vibes combine to capture the gentle, restorative nature of the workout video, while excluding more intense vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' due to their high-intensity nature, which is not present in this context."
