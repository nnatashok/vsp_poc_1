  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout video is 'Soothing & Restorative,' as evidenced by the title and description emphasizing 'Stretch, Relax & Recover.' The mention of 'recovery,' 'rest day,' and the gentle nature of the workout suggest a focus on relaxation and restoration, warranting a high score of 0.9. The repeated references to yoga and stretching highlight the workout's healing and calming intentions. Additionally, user comments praising the video's no-talking, continuous flow, and its role as the best stretch video, further suggest 'Soothing & Restorative' as the dominant spirit.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' given the 50-second work intervals with 10-second rests, maintaining a consistent pattern of movement. The mention of smooth transitions and non-stop stretches suggests a degree of flow, hence a score of 0.6. While the video is structured, it lacks the precision and technical focus typical of 'Structured & Disciplined,' and there is no indication of intense energy or outdoor elements, ruling out those spirits."
