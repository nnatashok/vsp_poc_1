  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Gentle Seated Yoga For Beginners & All Levels | 30 Minute Practice' embodies qualities of \"The Zen Flow,\" \"The Comfort Moves,\" and \"The Reboot Workout.\" The descriptor \"gentle,\" coupled with a focus on breath, presence, and relaxation, strongly aligns with \"The Zen Flow,\" emphasizing a grounding and intentional practice. The seated and floor stretches, suitable for 'every body' and promoted as slow and for beginners, suggest accessible, feel-good movement, characteristic of \"The Comfort Moves.\" Comments from users affirm its suitability for beginners and those with limited mobility, reinforcing this vibe. Additionally, the practice's mention of feeling relaxed and rejuvenated post-session fits \"The Reboot Workout,\" which focuses on low-stress, total-body refreshment. Indicators from both the title and description, alongside positive feedback about the practice's gentleness and inclusivity, lend high confidence to this classification, with \"The Zen Flow\" being the strongest match."
