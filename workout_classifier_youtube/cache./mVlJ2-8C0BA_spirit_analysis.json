  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit 'Structured & Disciplined' (0.85) is evident from the video description and the structured design of the workout. The session includes specific sets and repetitions, targeting all major muscle groups with a structured approach using dumbbells, which aligns with the disciplined nature of progressive strength training. The video description mentions three sets of exercises with precise timing (45 seconds on, 15 seconds rest), further confirming this spirit.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit (0.6) is supported by the goal of burning fat and boosting metabolism, common indicators of higher intensity workouts. Users' comments reflect the physical challenge, mentioning the increase in weight used as progression.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (0.5) is applicable due to the continuous movement from exercise to exercise and the emphasis on feeling confident and strong. However, it's less emphasized compared to the other spirits.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is mentioned due to the pace and transitions between exercises, but possibly less emphasized compared to typical flow-focused workouts. Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' are clearly not the focus based on the workout's indoor setting and intense energy goals."
