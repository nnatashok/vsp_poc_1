  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout strongly embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, indicated by the title '15 Minute Fat Burning HIIT Workout' and the description, which highlights exercises like high knees, lunge jumps, and mountain climbers. These are fast-paced and designed for maximum effort, fitting the spirit with high confidence (0.9). The second spirit, 'Structured & Disciplined,' is supported by the clear structure given in the description with specific rounds, exercises, and rest intervals (3 rounds, 5 exercises, 35 seconds work with 25 seconds rest), showing a methodical approach to HIIT (score: 0.75). The tags and comments praising the straightforward and impactful nature of the workout further confirm these classifications. While 'Sport & Agility' could have aspects of agility training, the primary focus remains on high intensity and structured execution, thus it was not included as a primary spirit."
