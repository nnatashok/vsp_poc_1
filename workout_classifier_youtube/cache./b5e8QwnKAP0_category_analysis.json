  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily categorized as \"Body weight\" with a score of 0.9, because the video focuses on a push-up workout, a classic bodyweight exercise aimed at enhancing strength. This is supported by the title \"Guided 100 Push Up Workout!\" and the description detailing it as a push-up series. \"Calisthenics\" is also relevant with a score of 0.7 due to the nature of push-ups as a calisthenic movement, involving gymnastic-like bodyweight exercises to build strength and flexibility. While primarily focused on push-ups, the mention of varying types like 'Wide' and 'Clapping push-ups' reflects calisthenic principles. \"Other\" is considered with a score of 0.3 to acknowledge the potential addition of alternative exercises mentioned in the description, but this is less specialized and specific, making it a minor classification. The high confidence in categorization is due to explicit indicators from the title, comments about push-ups, and focus of the channel on fitness exercises, particularly bodyweight methods."
