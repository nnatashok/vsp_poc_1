  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Stretching' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is supported by the repeated emphasis on 'stretch' and 'stretching routine' in the title, description, and tags. The description specifically mentions a '20 Minute Full Body Stretch Routine' with exercises traditionally associated with stretching activities. \n\nThe category 'Yoga' is considered with a moderate score of 0.5 due to elements such as 'Cat-Cow', 'Child's Pose', and 'Cobra', which are common in yoga routines. Although not explicitly labeled as a yoga workout, the presence of multiple yoga poses justifies its inclusion.\n\n'Pilates' is also considered relevant with a score of 0.4. The instructor is referred to as a 'Pilates instructor', and the video is tagged with terms like 'pilates stretch' and 'pilates full body stretch'. However, the focus remains more on stretching than on typical pilates exercises. \n\nOther potential categories like 'Mat', 'Body weight', and 'Calisthenics' were not chosen as the content is very targeted towards improving flexibility and stretching without emphasis on strength or gymnastics exercises."
