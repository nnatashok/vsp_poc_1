    "If you&#39;re like me and you&#39;re so out of shape that you can&#39;t do this entire workout, don&#39;t worry - it gets easier. Today was my second day and, while I still had to take a break and not have the resistance as high, it was easier than the first time. You got this!",
    "Every morning you kick my ass and I love it I\u2019m down 20 lbs in a month with doing your cycling and changing my eating \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe",
    "I\u2019m 66 years old and I finally did the whole work out. I got off my seat I increase my resistance I am so proud of myself. Thanks girlfriend",
    "I literally can&#39;t believe how quickly you&#39;re getting me into shape. I feel elated after the workout and that&#39;s something I haven&#39;t had in years!! You&#39;re a fantastic teacher!",
