  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is strongly classified as 'Yoga' with a score of 0.9, as the title explicitly mentions 'Yoga for Back Tension' and the description details yoga movements specifically targeting back stretching and tension relief. The repetitive use of 'yoga' in both the title and tags supports this classification. Additionally, the channel 'Yoga With Bird' focuses on yoga-based content, further reinforcing the categorization as Yoga.\n\nThe secondary classification is 'Stretching', scored at 0.7. This is justified by the detailed description of movement types ('Flexion, Extension, Rotation') which are reminiscent of stretching activities. Tags such as 'back stretches', 'stretches for back', and phrases in the description referring to mobility and flexibility also indicate a stretching component. The combined emphasis on relieving tension and enhancing flexibility through these movements suggests a substantial stretching element. Since the primary activity is yoga-centered, the Stretching category receives a slightly lower score, focusing on its supportive role within the yoga framework.\n\nOther categories like 'Pilates' or 'Meditation' were considered but excluded due to the lack of specific indicators associated with those practices."
