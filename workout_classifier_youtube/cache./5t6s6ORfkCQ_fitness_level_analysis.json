  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves indoor cycling, a basic, repetitive motion that most individuals can perform with minimal technique. The tags and comments suggest a virtual cycling experience, indicating that the complexity lies primarily in pacing oneself rather than executing complex movements. However, slightly more advanced techniques may be involved in using resistance settings optimally, warranting a minor consideration for the intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 45 minutes implies a significant effort, especially for deconditioned users. The tags suggest a focus on fat burning, indicating a continuous moderate-to-high intensity effort. Comments highlight the motivation provided by the scenery, suggesting sustained engagement and exertion. Thus, the effort is challenging for general users, though manageable in a controlled indoor setting.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The extended duration (45 minutes) naturally progresses the required fitness level beyond beginner. While the technique is straightforward, the sustained effort suggests intermediate to advanced fitness levels to ensure participants can maintain intensity throughout. Most users can adapt intensity (resistance and speed), which supports the inclusion of intermediate level, while the duration and potential intensity recommend advanced levels for optimal participation."
