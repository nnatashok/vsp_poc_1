  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled \"15 Minute Guided Meditation | Clear & Calm The Mind In Uncertain Times\" from the Boho Beautiful Yoga channel is best classified under the vibes 'The Deep Recharge' and 'The Zen Flow'. The meditation is designed to \"clear and calm the mind\" and address \"stress, anxiety, and uncertainty\", indicative of a 'Deep Recharge' vibe, as it emphasizes a \"nervous system reset, ultra-gentle movement.\" This is confirmed by user comments describing emotional release and a feeling of lightness post-meditation, highlighting its suitability for emotional and stress relief. The reference to a \"meditative journey\" and \"inner peace\" aligns with the 'Zen Flow' vibe, emphasizing a grounding, intentional practice. The high score for 'The Deep Recharge' (0.9) reflects strong alignment with this vibe given the focus on calming, stress-relief, and emotional release. 'The Zen Flow' receives a moderate score (0.7) due to its breath-centered, peaceful nature, although it is secondary to the deeper recharge aspects. Other potential vibes like 'The Mindful Walk' or 'The Sleep Prep' are excluded due to the focus on emotional rather than physical movement or sleep preparation."
