  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' due to the focus on stretching, flexibility, and mobility improvements, as indicated by the title '30 Minute Full Body Stretching Exercises - How to Stretch to Improve Flexibility & Mobility Routine'. The tags further emphasize this with terms like 'flexibility exercises', 'stretching routine', and 'mobility training', suggesting an aim for relaxation and recovery. Comments praising the session's efficacy in providing a comprehensive stretch support this classification. A high score of 0.85 is justified by the video\u2019s intention to restore flexibility and ease tension.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is also relevant, as the workout follows a '30 Minute Full Body' structure, indicating a methodological and planned routine. The channel's reputation for structured workout programs and the comment noting 'excellent instruction' further reinforce this spirit. The score of 0.65 reflects the disciplined nature of following a full routine within a set time frame.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to the lack of intensity, sports-specific training, or outdoor elements."
