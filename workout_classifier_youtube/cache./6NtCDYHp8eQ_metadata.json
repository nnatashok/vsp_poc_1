    "I do like the short workouts as some days that is all I can do. But at least I&#39;m moving and keeping it going. Thank you ladies.",
    "Thank you both for these workouts.  I&#39;m a pre-diabetic &amp; carrying around 30-40 extra pounds.  I&#39;ve changed by eating habits an picked up indoor walking along to your videos.  In 7 weeks, I&#39;ve lost 15lb.  As someone who has never maintained an exercise routine in 56 years, I can honestly say, your workouts are just what I need.  I&#39;m able to challenge myself without injury and that&#39;s a big plus.",
    "I would like to thank you for your great workouts. I am retired and have lived a very inactive life. Your exercises allow me to be more active and to slowly build up a programme. I also love your cheerful and happy presentation.  Thank you so much\u2764",
    "Love your videos! Makes working in exercise time so easy. And your Mom is so adorable and funny.",
    "I&#39;m so blessed to have come across your exercise workouts, I&#39;m 78 years old with some knee and back issues but ever since I started doing your different work outs three months ago I have been feeling better and less stiff.  Your mom gives me inspiration, she has a great sense of humor. And love your kitty Mochi he is and  a beautiful kitty and playful as well. Also love the music background for the exercises. Thank you so much \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\u2764"
