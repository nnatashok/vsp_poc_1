  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.95. This is evident from the video's core focus on guided meditation for anxiety relief and relaxation, as seen in the title 'Guided Meditation for Anxiety | SURRENDER SESSION | Letting Go.' The description further reinforces this by emphasizing benefits like cultivating relaxation, self-awareness, emotional regulation, cognitive improvement, stress reduction, and resilience. These points highlight the restorative and soothing nature of the session, aimed at reducing anxiety and promoting calmness. \n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a moderate score of 0.5. This classification is due to the guided meditation's structured, flowing process of thought observation and emotional detachment. The use of terms like 'surrender session' implies a gentle, rhythmic guidance through the meditation, aligning with the mind-body connection implicit in flow. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the video's focus on relaxation rather than intensity or athleticism."
