  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a 'HIIT Indoor Cycling Workout,' as described in both the title and the description. The specific mention of 'indoor cycling workout' and terms like 'cycling session,' 'spinning,' and 'trainer session' found in the tags indicate that an exercise bike, stationary bike, or a turbo trainer would be required to perform this workout. The description further supports this by discussing VO2 max intervals and cycling strength, which are specific to cycling exercises. Therefore, with these explicit mentions, the confidence level for requiring an exercise bike is very high, set at 1.0."
