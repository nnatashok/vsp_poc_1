  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to the significant cardiovascular component and sustained activity level implied by terms such as 'cardio workout' and 'keep the heart rate up my average was 138' found in the top comments. The nature of the exercises, including burpees and plank variations, suggests a strong, sustained physical demand, short of explosive intensity common in HIIT.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is included with a moderate score because the workout comprises a sequence of diverse, continuous movements without rests, promoting coordination and a degree of choreography found in phrases like 'no repeat, low impact steady state cardio.' While not explicitly music-driven, the need to pace oneself and the sequential exercise listing imply a rhythmic flow.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' received a consideration due to the 'timing' (45 seconds per exercise, mentioned) and the planned, varied move progression, characteristic of the structured walkthrough of a disciplined routine. This classification is also supported by Caroline's background as a certified personal trainer, emphasizing precision."
