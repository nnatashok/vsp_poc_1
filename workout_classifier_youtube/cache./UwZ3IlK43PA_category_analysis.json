  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is primarily classified as 'Body weight' with a high confidence score of 0.8 because the title and description emphasize 'strength training exercises' specifically designed for kids, which typically involves body weight exercises such as push-ups or squats. The tags further reinforce this with multiple mentions of 'kids strength training' and 'kids strength workout'. \n\n'Calisthenics' is also selected with a moderate score of 0.5, as the workout likely includes gymnastic-style movements emphasizing natural body movements and coordination\u2014common in workouts aimed at children, especially based on the mention of 'workout for dancers' and 'kids dance training'. The use of \"get stronger\" suggests exercises focussed on developing strength, indicative of calisthenics principles.\n\nOther categories such as 'HIIT' or 'Mat' were considered but not chosen, as HIIT is less likely due to the absence of specific intervals or rest periods mentioned, and Mat does not fit because the focus is on strength rather than general floor exercises or choreography."
