  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of this video is \"The Zen Flow\" with a high confidence score of 0.9. The title suggests a guided meditation aimed at spiritual awakening, which aligns with the grounding and intentional nature of Zen Flow. The description supports this with phrases like \"guided meditative journey\" and \"reflect and look ahead,\" suggesting a focus on breath and grounding. Additionally, comments like \"amazing experience\" and \"divine light in you that is also in me\" emphasize the meditative and present-centered experience.\n\nThe secondary vibe is \"The Deep Recharge,\" scoring 0.7. This is inferred from the video's intent for stress relief and inviting dormant traits within oneself, common in exercises that aim to reset the nervous system. Tags like \"stress relief\" and \"sleep meditations\" support this classification.\n\nLastly, \"The Reboot Workout\" scores 0.4, recognizing elements of a refresh in descriptions such as \"feather your nest\" and \"beautiful guided meditative journey,\" although it's less central than the other vibes. The confidence is high due to explicit indicators of a calming and rejuvenating experience in both metadata and comments."
