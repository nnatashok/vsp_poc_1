  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '10-Minute Guided Meditation: Self-Love | SELF' is a guided meditation session, as evidenced by the title, description, and tags. These elements focus on meditation and mindfulness, indicating that this is a mental and relaxation exercise rather than a physical workout. The absence of any terms or phrases relating to physical equipment use suggests that no additional equipment is needed to participate in this session. The session is designed for self-reflection and mental clarity, which typically do not require any physical instruments. Therefore, the workout appears to be fully bodyweight or mind-only, implying no need for equipment, such as mats or other items, for an effective session."
