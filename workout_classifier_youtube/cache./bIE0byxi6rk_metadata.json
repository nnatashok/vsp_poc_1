  "title": "*NEW* Insane 20 Minute Elliptical Workout - HIIT Workout",
  "description": "Dr. Kevin from abundantyou.com gives you another follow-along NEW insane 20 minute HIIT workout using an elliptical. This elliptical workout will push your to your MAXIMUM.  #EllipticalWorkout #HIITWorkout #Elliptical\n\nAn elliptical workout machine with handles is one of the few cardio machines that can provide you with both an upper- and lower-body workout. The key to maximizing the upper-body benefits is to distribute your weight and resistance evenly by pumping your arms just as fast as you\u2019re moving your legs.\n\nThe elliptical is known for putting less stress on your joints. Studies show that it can significantly reduce weight bearing compared to running, jogging, and similar workouts. This means its the perfect choice to continue training your body without the wear and tear that comes with high-impact exercises. I love working out on an elliptical machine!\n\nMost people use an elliptical to get their steady-state cardio workouts in. I however, recommend it for more high-intensity interval training like this workout I provided! This will maximize the fat burning effects in a shorter amount of time.\n\nPlease feel free to increase your elliptical resistance or incline, to target specific leg muscles and make your HIIT workout more challenging. The higher the pitch the more butt activation you will get. I recommend increasing the pitch as the rounds move forward. \n\nRemember, HIIT workouts and elliptical workout machines are amazing for you fitness and health! However, they should not be overused and be the only exercises you do. You need different muscle activation, progressive load changes, and variations with all your workout routines.  #EllipticalWorkout #Elliptical #HIITWorkout\n\nI recommend to perform a 10-30 minute HIIT workout 2-3 times a week, with 24 hour rest in between HIIT workouts, in addition to other variety of fitness activities like weight-training.  \n\nThis NEW elliptical workout video is 20  minutes of sprint training, going as hard as you can for 8 rounds of 30 seconds, spaced with 90 seconds of low intensity. It's important to catch your breath FULLY before each round so you can really push it to the max!\n\n-- LINKS --\n\ud83d\udcd5  Download the FREE eBook: Top 7 HIIT Workout Secrets For Weight Loss \ud83d\udcd5\n\u25bahttps://www.abundantyou.com/7-hiit-secrets-ebook/\nYou'll learn how to make your HIIT workout more effective towards weight loss and avoid the common mistakes people when doing HIIT workouts!\n\nTo learn more visit:\nhttps://www.abundantyouchiro.com/ - Holistic Wellness Center Columbus, Ohio\nhttps://abundantyou.com/ - Natural Health Made Easy Blog\nhttps://askdrkevin.com/ - Ask Dr. Kevin a question!\n\n\nWe start the ALL elliptical workouts with a 5 minute warm-up and finish with a 3 minute cool-down.

    "I love your workouts!!! With this, eating nutritiously and make all efforts to get good sleep, I have lost 30 lbs in 4 months :)",
    "I don&#39;t usually post ever. <br>But I want to thank you Sir!<br>This workout has changed my life, I was 326lbs a year ago. I started eating better as a lost 25lbs. Then about 6 months ago started the 15 min cardio, this 2 months ago I moved to 20 min.  I&#39;m down from 3oolbs to 260! <br>Thank you Dr for doing what you do. Wish me luck on the 30 min hit, I will start next week!",
    "Hey thank you for helping me workout 3 times a week. I spend my morning with you every other day.  I feel a lot better because of it. Now if I would just cut my carbs more, I&#39;d probably be able to loose a little more weight. I was 215 a month ago and now I am right around 200. I need to make it down to 180-175. <br>Thank you again.",
    "Thank you for posting this workout ! I got sensational results: I have been doing it during quarantine for 2 months now and I have lost 10 kgs. Of course my diet is clean but this workout definitely made a huge difference. Thank you!\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb"
