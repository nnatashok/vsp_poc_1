  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves multiple cycling positions like 'speed increases', 'sprints', 'speed over saddle', and 'jumps/freezes' which require good coordination and control of resistance and cadence. Cycling workouts generally require maintaining proper posture and technique, especially during high-intensity intervals. The description emphasizes proper form, suggesting an intermediate level for coordinating different speeds and positions during the workout, supported by the instructor's credentials as a certified Spin instructor.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration just under 18 minutes and being labeled as a 'HIIT CARDIO' workout, it suggests a high-intensity interval training format. The description highlights 'minimal recovery and maximum effort', which indicates significant energy expenditure. The class structure (sprints, speed over saddle) further supports a high effort level. However, the length is relatively short for a HIIT workout. This leads to a categorization as moderate to challenging in effort since it requires significant exertion especially for deconditioned users, but the duration keeps it accessible to some extent.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulty, the workout aligns best with intermediate users due to the coordination and effort levels implied, but elements like suggested form checking and moderate duration open it to beginners. The multiple suggested modifications (like staying in the saddle) make it accessible to beginners with some caution. Advanced users may find the intensity manageable, especially as the workout can be intensified by increasing resistance and cadence. Thus, it is rated for beginner to advanced levels, with a focus on intermediate suitability given the HIIT nature and instructor's guidance on form and self-pacing."
