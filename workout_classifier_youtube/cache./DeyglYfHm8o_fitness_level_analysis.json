The description states the workout is for \"any level,\" and the comments, including those from returning or recovering exercisers, indicate broad accessibility, presenting an intermediate fitness level fit as well for those who might want an easy session. Advanced users might use it as a warm-up or recovery workout. Thus, beginner and intermediate levels are prominent, with a minor role for advanced fitness levels."
