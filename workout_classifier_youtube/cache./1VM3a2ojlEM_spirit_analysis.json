  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled '30 min Beginner Yoga - Gentle Stretch & Flow Yoga' primarily embodies the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit, as evidenced by the focus on gentle stretches and the accommodation of beginners and seniors, which suggests an emphasis on relaxation and healing. The description emphasizes a slow, methodical approach ('move a bit slower,' 'effective yet gentle practice') suitable for all levels, indicating a restorative intention. The tags such as 'gentle yoga,' 'yoga for stress,' and 'yoga stretch,' along with user comments highlighting the gentle nature and suitability for older adults, reinforce this classification, warranting a high confidence score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the video reflects the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit, indicated by terms like 'flow yoga' and 'full body yoga flow' in both the title and description. The flow aspect is emphasized as being continuous and coordinated, aligning with rhythmic movement patterns. However, this is a secondary element compared to its restorative qualities, justifying a moderate match score of 0.7. The absence of intense or sport-specific elements excludes other spirits from consideration."
