  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit assigned is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.9, reflecting the focus on breath control and stress reduction. The video emphasizes improving lung capacity, reducing stress, and achieving balance and peace, which are key components of a restorative practice. This is supported by descriptions such as 'journey of calm and clarity' and 'pathway to enhancing your physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.' The channel's description aligns with promoting mental and physical well-being through yoga.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is assigned with a score of 0.6 due to the smooth, continuous nature of pranayama exercises and their role in connecting breath with movement. The video guides viewers through various breathing techniques, which implies a rhythmic follow-along structure akin to flowing yoga sequences.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' and other spirits were excluded as the metadata and comments do not suggest high physical intensity or athletic performance. Instead, the comments highlight health improvements from regular, gentle practice, reinforcing the restorative quality."
