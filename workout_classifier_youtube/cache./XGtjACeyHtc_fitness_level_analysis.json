  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of bodyweight exercises such as pulsing jump squats, frog jumps, vertical jumps, high knees, and jumping jack planks. These exercises require some coordination and balance, categorizing it as slightly complex, suitable for the 'Intermediate' level. The need for explosiveness in jumps and maintaining form for planks suggests an intermediate technique difficulty. The lack of equipment lowers the complexity slightly but still requires some skill and proper execution.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Despite being a short workout (5 minutes), the 40s/20s interval format is typically demanding due to minimal rest between high-intensity exercises. Several jumping movements like pulsing jump squats and frog jumps elevate the physical demand. The description mentions intense cardio and calorie burn, aligning with a 'Challenging' effort difficulty, especially for less fit users. User comments confirm the high level of exertion experienced, further supporting this rating.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The 'Beginner' level is included at a lower score since the short workout can be attempted by beginners willing to test higher-intensity intervals, especially given user comments about easing into the workout. 'Intermediate' is the primary fit due to the technique and effort levels required, as confirmed by both metadata and comments. 'Advanced' is possible for those looking to stack rounds or use the workout as an intense finisher, evidenced by suggestions of completing 3-4 rounds for a full workout. Modified for inclusive application, adapting pacing or repetitions can allow less fit users to participate."
