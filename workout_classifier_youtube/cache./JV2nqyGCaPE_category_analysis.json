  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Indoor biking' with a score of 1.0 because the video clearly focuses on an indoor cycling workout. The title 'Quick Sprint Session! | 10 Minute Indoor Cycling Workout' and the repeated use of terms like 'spin', 'indoor cycling', 'spin class', and 'spinning' in the tags strongly support this classification. The video is from the GCN Training channel, known for providing cycling workout content, further affirming this category.\n\nThe secondary category 'HIIT' is assigned with a score of 0.7 due to the presence of elements characteristic of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), such as 'interval', 'intervals', and 'HIIT' in the tags. The description mentions a 'quick progressive sprint session,' which suggests a high-intensity and time-efficient workout typical for HIIT sessions. The score is relatively high but lower than indoor biking because the primary form of exercise is cycling, and the HIIT aspect is inferred from the content rather than explicitly the main focus."
