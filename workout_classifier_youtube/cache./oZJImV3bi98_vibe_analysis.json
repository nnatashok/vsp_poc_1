  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled \"How To Start Weighted Calisthenics | THENX\" is a strong embodiment of \"The Progression Quest\" vibe with a score of 0.9. This is supported by the emphasis on systematic learning and incremental progress inherent to weighted calisthenics. The description mentions 'step by step guided tutorials' and 'systematic approach,' which align with gradual improvement and mastery over time.\n\n\"The Tactical Athlete\" vibe also fits with a score of 0.6 due to the military-inspired, performance-focused nature of weighted calisthenics, combined with the strategic approach highlighted in the title and description. The use of weighted vests suggests a functional and performance-oriented training style.\n\n\"The Foundation Builder\" vibe scores 0.7 because the video focuses on foundational calisthenics movements such as pull-ups, push-ups, and squats, building strength and perfecting fundamentals. The description emphasizes learning basic calisthenic moves like the Handstand and Muscle Up, supporting foundational training principles.\n\n\"The Meditative Grind\" was considered but excluded due to lack of repetitive endurance training elements."
