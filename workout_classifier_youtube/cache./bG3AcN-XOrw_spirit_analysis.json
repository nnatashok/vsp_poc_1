  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is best classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with extremely high confidence. The title '10 Min Guided Meditation For Sleep & Relaxation | Fall Asleep Fast With Soothing Rain Sounds' directly indicates a focus on sleep and relaxation, supported by the use of soothing rain sounds. The description reinforces this by highlighting the meditative, healing, and stress-relief aspects of the session: 'Relax and fall asleep fast,' 'soothing rain sounds,' 'healing meditation,' and 'let go of stress.' Additionally, the tags like 'guided meditation for sleep,' 'soothing rain sounds,' and 'meditation for stress' align perfectly with a restorative intent. The comments, such as expressions of emotional reassurance and a good night wish, further emphasize the calming, restorative nature of the video content. Thus, it strongly embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, with no significant indicators for other workout spirits."
