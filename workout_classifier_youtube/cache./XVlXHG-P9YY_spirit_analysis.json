  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Structured & Disciplined' with a high confidence score of 0.8. This is evident from the structured guidance of a fitness instructor, Tim Britton, focusing on a step-by-step approach suitable for beginners, as indicated in both the title and description. The workout involves following a specific protocol on an indoor cycle, which is a hallmark of structured training. The comments further reinforce this, noting the walk-through and instructional nature, highlighting the disciplined aspect of the workout.\n\nAdditionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is also present but with moderate confidence (0.5), due to the rhythmic nature of cycling to music often associated with spinning workouts. However, the primary emphasis appears to be on structured progression rather than pure rhythm, thus the score is lower.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are less relevant here as the workout accommodates beginners and allows for adjusting resistance based on the user's level. The soothing aspect is not emphasized, ruling out the 'Soothing & Restorative' classification."
