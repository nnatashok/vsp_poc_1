  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'gentle', focusing on stress reduction and relaxation, indicating low energy expenditure. The 30-minute duration could seem moderate for complete beginners in terms of mental endurance, but the physical intensity remains light throughout, as suggested by both the description and comments indicating calmness and relaxation. The lack of cardiovascular elements or intense flow further supports the classification as light effort difficulty, with minor indicators aligning with moderate due to duration.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout's gentle nature and stress reduction focus make it predominantly suitable for beginners, emphasized by 'all levels' in the description. The intermediate score reflects the potential challenge of maintaining poses like downward dog and balancing seated stretches for those completely new to yoga. The all-levels approach and nature of the poses allow for inclusion of multiple fitness levels, especially considering users can adapt pose depth based on their experience. The workout also provides a mild alignment with advanced users who may utilize the session for recovery or stress relief, accounting for the diversity of yoga practices among different fitness enthusiasts."
