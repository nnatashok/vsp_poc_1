  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves a slow jog or fast walk on a treadmill, which consists of very simple, straightforward movements. Walking and jogging require minimal coordination, making them suitable for beginners. The tags such as 'beginners,' 'walking,' and 'beginner workout' reinforce this level of simplicity in technique.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 15 minutes and the focus on a slow jog or fast walk suggest a low energy expenditure, fitting the 'Light' effort difficulty. The video is described as being good for beginners, indicating it is not very physically demanding. The lack of intense cardio cues in the metadata further supports this categorization.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The combination of low technique and effort difficulty positions this workout as very accessible for beginners, making the 'Beginner' level an obvious match. However, the added pace of a slow jog (as opposed to just walking) gives it just enough mild challenge to slightly touch the lower end of an 'Intermediate' level for very deconditioned users. The descriptors in the title and description assure it aligns strongly with the Beginner fitness level while mildly fitting Intermediate."
