  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under \"Structured & Disciplined\" with a score of 0.7, as it is designed as a prenatal strength routine, which suggests a methodical approach to suit the needs of pregnant individuals. The channel description emphasizes gym-quality workouts focusing on being strong and healthy, indicating a structured routine. Also, terms like \"Strength workout\" and references to specific equipment (mat, dumbbells) suggest this structured nature.\n\nThis workout also aligns with \"Soothing & Restorative\" with a score of 0.6. The workout is described as beginner-friendly and is tailored for the second trimester, which typically requires a gentle approach to accommodate the physiological changes during pregnancy. Commenters appreciated the calm approach and the mentioning of no back pain highlight a focus on safe and restorative movements.\n\nHigh-Energy & Intense is excluded due to the workout's beginner-friendly and prenatal focus, which is typically lower intensity. Sport & Agility, Outdoor & Adventure, and Flow & Rhythm are not relevant, as the workout takes place indoors with a structured strength focus rather than agility or exploratory movement."
