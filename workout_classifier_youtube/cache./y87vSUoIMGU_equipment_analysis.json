  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled 'UNWIND 20 Min Full Body Stretch Routine,' which strongly implies a stretching exercise suited for relaxation and recovery. In the description, it specifically mentions to 'simply roll out your mat and relax,' indicating that a mat is explicitly recommended for comfort during floor exercises. The tags also include terms like 'yoga' and 'relaxing stretches,' which are commonly associated with the use of a mat. Therefore, the mat is identified with very high confidence (0.9) as required equipment for performing the workout effectively. Since no other specific equipment is mentioned, no additional equipment is suggested for this routine."
