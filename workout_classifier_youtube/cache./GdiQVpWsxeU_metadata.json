    "This is an instant favorite. I recently quit a medication (ADHD stimulant) that no longer served any purpose, but that I was terrified to come off of and so I stayed stagnant and felt stuck for several years. I discovered your channel around 2 years ago and I\u2019ve spent the time since then building up skills, confidence and courage with good habits like these sessions (2 or 3 times daily), ice baths, exercise and nutrition. I\u2019m now over 2 weeks without the meds and I\u2019ve never felt more balanced or as able to live in gratitude with the ability to express it in positive ways. I\u2019ve never felt more connected and alive. I\u2019ve never felt like I had the tools needed to just simply exist and enjoy life as I do now. You\u2019ve really, honestly, sincerely changed my life for the better. I am eternally grateful and will remain a humble student. Thanks for all you do \u2764",
    "Dude, the production is so good across the board on these. Impressively intuitive, never thought breathwork could be this streamlined and accessible, thanks Sandy!",
    "I\u2019ve never felt the need to comment on a video before, but this was absolute perfection. My son is doing kids yoga next to me, my baby is sleeping, and this breathing routine felt life changing for a tired mom.. in this moment life is good. Thank you \u2764",
    "I wonder if you really know how much you are helping people. Thank you for helping me, these are the best breathing videos on the internet. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that this has changed my life and myself and everyone around me are benefitting. Thanks again, Sandy. Have a great day"
