  "spiritsExplanation": "The video title, '15 min METABOLIC BOOSTING cycling workout,' indicates a focus on raising energy levels, which aligns with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The description further supports this with phrases like 'high-intensity push' and 'get your sweat on,' warranting a score of 0.7 for this spirit. Additionally, the workout's elements such as 'INVERTED SPRINTS' and 'CLIMBS' suggest a more intense session. However, the workout also presents flexibility in its intensity, as noted by 'low-intensity ride on an active recovery day,' suggesting some elements of 'Soothing & Restorative' but these are minimal given the context.\n\nThe presence of music matched with workout stages like 'WARM UP,' 'ROLLING HILLS,' and 'COOL DOWN' indicates a rhythmic and coordinated progression, justifying a 'Flow & Rhythm' score of 0.6. This is reinforced by structured chapters with music-driven pacing.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' element is seen through the precise breakdown of resistance levels and measure of RPMs, although it offers flexibility, scoring 0.55. Channel information on structured cycle training also complements this spirit, even though it's a brief session oriented towards metabolic boosting rather than detailed form focus."
