  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified predominantly under 'High-Energy & Intense' due to its focus on strength and cardio intervals designed to boost metabolism and heart rate, as mentioned in the title and reinforced with phrases like 'get your heart rate up' and 'push yourself to your highest intensity.' The workout includes compound exercises and cardio, reflecting a fast-paced session. The repeated format of 45 seconds work and 15 seconds rest also supports this classification, indicating high intensity. The score of 0.95 reflects the strong emphasis on intensity and effort.\n\nAdditionally, 'Structured & Disciplined' is applicable due to the methodical nature of the workout. The structure is evident in the use of circuits and progressive intensity (e.g., working with 75%-85% of max weight), showcasing a systematic and disciplined approach to building strength and conditioning. This classification scores 0.75 as the structured format supports discipline but is secondary to intensity.\n\nWhile other spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' might be minimally present in terms of continuous exercise flow, the intensity and structured nature dominate. 'Soothing & Restorative' is notably absent due to the workout's challenging nature."
