  "spiritsExplanation": "The video title \"Runner's Yoga - Yoga With Adriene\" and description emphasize a practice intended for release and rehabilitation, especially suitable after running or cardio exercises. Key phrases in the description such as \"great release and rehab,\" \"soothe the muscles of the body,\" and \"balance and restore\" strongly indicate a Soothing & Restorative spirit, therefore a high score of 0.9 is given.\n\nThe use of breath and smooth sequences typically associated with yoga suggest a Flow & Rhythm spirit. This is supported by terms like \"use the breath to stretch\" and \"sequence stays low to the ground,\" granting it a score of 0.6.\n\nThere is a mild Structured & Disciplined element, as yoga practices often involve methodical movement and focus, especially as this video supports athletes. This justification aligns with the tag \"yoga for athletes,\" earning it a score of 0.4. Other spirits like High-Energy & Intense and Sport & Agility are less applicable due to the gentle, restorative focus of the session."
