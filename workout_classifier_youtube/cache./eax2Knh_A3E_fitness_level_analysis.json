  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily composed of simple movements, such as walking, side steps, mini squats, and jumping jacks, which require minimal coordination and skill, suggesting a Beginner level. The inclusion of low-impact versions of more complex moves like skaters and mini side lunges slightly pushes it towards Intermediate, but the overall focus is on accessible, low-complexity exercises. The channel's ethos of simple walk workouts reinforces the Beginner classification, while occasional moderate coordination is necessary for certain movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Although marketed as a HIIT workout, the primary activity is walking, which indicates a lower energy expenditure typical of Moderate effort. However, the workout's long duration (56 minutes) increases overall effort. There are segments with higher intensity movements (jumping jacks and skaters), contributing a Challenging score with intermittent rest periods. The comments persuade that despite the long duration, the effort remains manageable due to breaks, affirming the Moderate-to-Challenging classification range.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the long duration of this 56-minute workout, the Beginner classification is possible but less assured, so it's rated lower. The primary activities and the presence of rests make it accessible to Beginners, yet the extended time, variety of exercises, and some higher-intensity segments also make it suitable for Intermediate and Advanced levels. The varied fitness level assignment allows for a broader audience, acknowledging that Beginners can attempt the workout with pacing and rest, while more experienced exercisers can keep up with the full routine for a greater challenge."
