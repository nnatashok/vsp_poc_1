  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as an 'easy to follow full body practice,' which suggests movements that are accessible to beginners. The video is a daily yoga flow, typically featuring basic yoga poses suitable for beginners but also includes options to suit different levels, indicating some intermediate elements as well. Channel emphasis on vinyasa flow and 'creative, playful' sequencing combined with over 500 hours of teacher training implies some intermediate techniques that require coordination and body awareness typical of slightly more complex flow sequences.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 15 minutes suggests a light to moderate effort level, suitable for beginners and those seeking gentle activity. The description emphasizes suitability for everyday practice, implying low intensity. However, the inclusion of a full body sequence and the mention of providing thoroughly engaging flows indicates a moderate fitness challenge for some users, as yoga, depending on execution, can vary in intensity.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique difficulty and effort difficulty assessments as predominantly beginner with some intermediate elements, this session is suitable for both beginners and intermediate participants. The inclusion of modifications and 'options to suit different levels' in the description justifies the inclusion of multiple fitness levels. User feedback highlights the session as being rewarding for those new to yoga ('slow and couldn\u2019t have been more pleased') and as a consistent helpful routine ('4-5 times a week') reaffirming its accessibility."
