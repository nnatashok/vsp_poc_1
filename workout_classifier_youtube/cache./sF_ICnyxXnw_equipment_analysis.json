  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled \"20 Min INTERMEDIATE CALISTHENICS WORKOUT at Home | No Equipment,\" and both the title and description clearly indicate that no equipment is needed. The tags such as \"no equipment calisthenics,\" \"calisthenics at home,\" and \"no equipment\" reinforce the bodyweight nature of the workout. Furthermore, the description highlights it as a \"no equipment full body intermediate Calisthenics workout you can do at home,\" emphasizing the bodyweight aspect without the need for any additional tools or props. User comments and the channel's focus on calisthenics workout types further support that this specific video does not require equipment, aligning with its description of building strength and skill through calisthenics exercises alone. Therefore, the analysis concludes that this workout is entirely bodyweight-based, and no equipment is needed, which justifies the empty requiredEquipment array."
