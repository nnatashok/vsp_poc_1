  "description": "This 15 minute guided meditation to clear and calm the mind is a perfect powerful practice for beginner & experienced meditation practices.  It is perfect tool to help cope with the uncertainty, to ground and rebalance yourself and your constant wandering mind. \n\nThrough the simple act of reconnecting with your inner self and practicing the idea of positive affirmations of gratitude for the simple things in life, this easy guided meditation is perfect for anyone that is needing some positivity and calm during these uncertain times. It is time to let go of the negativity, stress, anxiety....whatever is holding you back in your life. Let this class take you on a meditative journey to cleanse and heal yourself from the inside out.\n\nAs you close your eyes and virtually join me on this meditative canoe ride through the Amazon River in Peru, may gift yourself the opportunity to let go of all that no longer serves you. Let go of the tension, the stress, the anxiety, the fear, whatever it is that is holding you back in your mind and simply focus on that inner feeling of peace and joy that is within you. Let go and go within. \n\nSo find a quiet space, put some headphones on, close your eyes, and enjoy. \n\n\ud83d\udea8\u00a0Check out our NEW youtube channel dedicated EXCLUSIVELY to Meditations \ud83d\udea8\u00a0\nhttps://flow.bohobeautiful.life/BohoBeautifulMind-\n\n\u203b \u203b \u203b \u203b \u203b\n\nFREE BOHO OFFERINGS:\n\n\u27a4 FREE 7-Day Blissful Body Bootcamp \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc. \nGet amazing results in just 15 minutes a day\nhttps://bohobeautiful.life/freefitness\n\n\u27a4 FREE 14 Day Yoga & Meditation Journey: \nhttps://bohobeautiful.life/freeyoga\n\n\u27a4 FREE 31 Days of Yoga Program: \nhttps://bohobeautiful.life/31days\n\n\u27a4 FREE Yoga Journey Guidebook\nhttps://bohobeautiful.life/yogaguidebook/\n\n\u203b \u203b \u203b \u203b \u203b\n\nOur App & Streaming Platform...\n\n\u27a4   Boho Beautiful Official App \ud83c\udf0d \nOur yoga, fitness, meditation, & high-vibrational living app. Join the community!\nhttps://www.bohobeautiful.tv \n\nApple Store \ud83d\udcf1 \n\u27a4 https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \n\nAndroid Store  \ud83d\udda5 \n\u27a4 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\n\u203b \u203b \u203b \u203b \u203b\n\nLINKS:\n\n\u27a4 Boho Beautiful Store\nhttps://shop.bohobeautiful.life/\n\n\u27a4 Podcast\n     @starsanddestruct \nhttps://www.starsanddestruct.com\n\n\u27a4 Our 2nd More Personal YouTube Channel: \n    @BohoBeautifulLife \n      \n\u27a4Our New channel Dedicated EXCLUSIVELY to Meditations:\n    @BohoBeautifulMeditation \n    \nInstagram Family\n\u27a4 https://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\u27a4 https://instagram.com/mark.spicoluk\n\u27a4 https://instagram.com/juliana.spicoluk\n\n#BohoBeautiful  #Meditation   #GuidedMeditation \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBoho Beautiful Yoga is a yoga fitness lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth. \n\nYour Decisions Today Will Define Your Tomorrow \u2764",

    "I am so incredibly grateful for this meditation. I went into it feeling stressed and anxious, and came out of it with tears streaming down my face. As soon as the simple, powerful mantra was introduced, I couldn\u2019t help but just cry. It felt so releasing. I am grateful for all that I have in my life, especially during these tough times. Thank you guys so much. <br>Sending you both love and light. Namaste."
