  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves a variety of calisthenics exercises such as push-ups, lunges, and plank variations, some of which require body awareness and coordination. Exercises like 'low to high plank' and 'uneven push up' suggest a moderate to high level of technical skill is required, fitting intermediate to advanced levels. The multiple movements within a complex format imply a need for some coordination and balance, supporting an intermediate classification. Comments from users suggest the workout is challenging, further confirming the complex nature of some moves.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 40 minutes long, increasing the likelihood of high intensity. Exercises structured in continuous 3-minute complexes with only 20 seconds rest indicate a high demand on endurance and energy expenditure. User comments describe it as 'the toughest workout' and challenging, indicating a high physical demand. The length and intensity suggest a challenging to extreme effort level, especially for less conditioned participants.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulties, this workout is primarily suited for individuals with some fitness background. The 40-minute duration, along with high-intensity complexes, would be difficult for beginners. The challenging nature of exercises like complex planks and lunges combined with minimal rest suggests an intermediate or advanced fitness level is more appropriate. User comments and the inferred intensity of the workout support this classification. Although the workout is accessible at a lower intensity (modifications implied), the exercises and duration limit suitability to experienced beginners or higher."
