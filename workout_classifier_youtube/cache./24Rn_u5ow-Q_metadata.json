    "Wishing everyone hope, peace and health and hoping that you will find this short guided meditation exercise useful. This is remastered from an older work and is created to enable you to find relaxation in a few minutes. It\u2019s especially useful when we\u2019re pushed for time because even 5 or ten minutes is healing and healthful to both mind and body. We hope you find it useful",
    "Wow, this guided meditation really helped me find a peaceful sanctuary within myself. The soothing voice and tranquil visuals transported me to a serene world of wisdom stones. In just 7 minutes, I was able to let go of all my stress and worries, leaving me feeling recharged and at ease. Thank you for sharing this incredible experience!",
    "Dear Honest Guys, you make me happy. You two look honestly nice. \u2764\u2764\u2764 it\u2019s hard to believe in good people in this world, since 95% people are egotism pure (and don\u2019t even realise it). selfless people suffer horribly. Honestly nice people are honestly even better than meditation, which can be an mere escape from dishonest and egotistical world. So thanks for being who you are.",

    "wowowowow!<br><br>the voice, the sound effects, the proper guidance with the right words! <br>it made my whole body shiver! <br>I was RELEASING tension from my body, litterally without my control, it was shaking itself.<br>I was shaking like crazy, and all the tension I had in my body got released and I feel so relieved! <br>I&#39;ve NEVER experienced something like this ever before!!!<br>This was MAGIC!<br><br>I even connected with my inner insecurities, and they asked questions like &quot;am I loved?&quot; &quot;will I be okay?&quot; <br><br>and the voice responded back &quot;yes you will, yes you are!&quot; <br><br>it was INTENSE!"
