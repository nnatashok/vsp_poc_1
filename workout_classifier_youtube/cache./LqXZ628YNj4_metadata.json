    "Remember that this fiery morning session is designed to support you as you cultivate and manifest. <br><br>How do you feel after today&#39;s practice?",
    "I was in a medically induced coma back in April because of an intentional overdose. I was in that coma for nearly 3 weeks. When they pulled out the breathing tube they were literally praying because at that point only God knew if I was going to make it. For some reason I was never offered physical therapy. Then my father committed suicide a little over a month ago. I picked up yoga again shortly after that. Yoga is one of few things that are helping me today. My mother even practices with me sometimes. Thank you, Adriene, for this beautiful practice. I got frustrated at first because my wrists and knees are still weak, but the sweat and shake reminds me that I&#39;m still alive. Even if things are messy and difficult, I&#39;m going to keep moving. I love you and I love everyone in the yoga community. Pain is temporary. \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4",
    "I cried about 1 minute into the video, while doing child&#39;s pose.. I felt so lonely. Being an adult is more hard work than they let on \ud83d\ude02<br>I cried again just now because I realised over 10,000 people did the yoga with me. Not so alone after all. That&#39;s a nice thought to hold on to. Thank you.",
    "Today marks 1,095 consecutive days of YWA. 3 full years. Thank you Adriene, Benji, YWA team and community. This is life changing. \ud83d\ude4f",
    "I did not expect to get absolutely rocked by yoga this morning, but here we are. I haven&#39;t even had coffee yet and I feel like I could run a marathon (which is a gross overestimation of my abilities)."
