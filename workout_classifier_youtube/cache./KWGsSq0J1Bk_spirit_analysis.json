  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative,' with a high confidence level (0.9) and a strong match score (0.95). Key indicators include phrases such as '15-minute guided foam rolling session for self-massage,' 'Say goodbye to tight muscles,' and 'perfect for a recovery day.' The focus on relaxing tight muscles, recovery, and feeling amazing after the workout strongly aligns with this spirit. The channel Well+Good, known for promoting wellness, supports this classification.\n\nThe secondary spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant, albeit to a lesser degree (score: 0.55). The guided nature of the session and the emphasis on continuous rolling through muscle groups suggest elements of fluid and rhythmic movement, as echoed in comments praising the 'choice, order, and guidance.' This indicates a level of smooth, coordinated effort similar to Flow & Rhythm workouts.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the session's focus on relaxation rather than intensity or athleticism. The humor in user comments about pain suggests some intensity but not the high-energy or athletic spirit."
