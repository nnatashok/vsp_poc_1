  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under 'Calisthenics' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is strongly supported by the repeated mention of 'calisthenics' in the title, tags, and description, indicating a workout focused on gymnastic exercises for strength using bodyweight movements. The presence of moves like push-ups, lunges, and planks further supports this classification. 'Body weight' is also relevant with a score of 0.7, as the description and tags emphasize a 'bodyweight only workout,' indicating exercises that use one's own weight for resistance. The inclusion of terms like 'no equipment workout' and 'home workout' aligns with bodyweight training. Lastly, 'Mat' is assigned a score of 0.5 considering the mention of using a 'mat' and the nature of floor exercises like planks and squats, although these elements are less central to the workout focus compared to calisthenics. Other categories like 'HIIT' or 'Weight workout' were excluded as there is no indication of interval training or use of weights."
