  "description": "40 MIN TABATA?!?!? \"ABSURD!\" They said...\n\nThis workout will TEST you, but i know for a fact that you can do it. IF at any point in this workout, you feel a little overworked or overwhelmed, take a break sis...its okay, it really is. There is no need to overdo it - the results will come if you stay consistent and keep slowly chipping away at your goal. If you do this, your results will be more permanent and sustainable!\n\nTodays\u2019 workout starts with a 5 minute warm up - we will be doing 1 minute for each exercise.\n\nThen we will go into the tabata portion of the workout (the remaining 35 mins). We will be doing each exercise twice. The first round will be a \u201cpractice round\u201d and the second we are going to go ALL OUT! You heard me sis, ALL OUT\n\nLower Belly and Booty TABATA \nApple Watch Setting: Indoor Walk/Mixed Cardio\nIntensity: 10/10\nCalories Burned: 515\nLength: 40 mins\n\nIf any of the exercises are too challenging for you or youre just not feeling the vibe, just walk it out.
