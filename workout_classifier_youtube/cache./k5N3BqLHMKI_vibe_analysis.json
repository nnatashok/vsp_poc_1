  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is strongly categorized as 'The Firestarter' due to the explicit mention of a '20-minute high intensity interval training workout,' characteristic of short, intense bursts that are typically associated with HIIT and interval training (score: 0.8). Additionally, the title's reference to burning '1000+ calories' implies a highly energetic and explosive session, supporting this categorization. 'The Endorphin Wave' is also applicable, as the workout promotes a feel-good, steady build of energy, inferred from comments detailing emotional breakthroughs and significant weight loss (score: 0.6). The workout's emphasis on sweating, calorie burning, and elements like 'sprint' and 'race' vibes the 'The Warrior Workout' with the intense, primal energy of pushing through limits (score: 0.6). The explicit Orange Theory inspiration supports a structured yet intense interval experience. Other potential vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Zen Flow' were excluded due to the lack of emphasis on calm or repetitive endurance aspects."
