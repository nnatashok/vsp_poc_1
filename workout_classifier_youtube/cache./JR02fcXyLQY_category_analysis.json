  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Meditation,' which is chosen with high confidence (score: 0.9) due to the explicit mentions in the title, description, and hashtags (#meditation, #guidedmeditation). The video is a '15 Min Guided Meditation For Stress & Anxiety,' clearly indicating the primary focus is on meditation techniques. The channel, 'Boho Beautiful Yoga,' frequently features meditation and mindfulness content, reinforcing this categorization. The description further describes the session as an opportunity to 'sit in stillness' and to 'find peace,' common themes in meditation practices. \nA secondary category, 'Breathing exercises,' is included with a lower score (0.3), acknowledging that meditation often involves some form of guided breathing, though there is no specific mention of breathing techniques, so its presence is inferred rather than explicit. 'Other' categories, such as Yoga or Stretching, are not applicable due to a lack of any connecting evidence in the metadata."
