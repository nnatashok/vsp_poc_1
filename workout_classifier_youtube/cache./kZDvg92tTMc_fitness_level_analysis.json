  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features a variety of exercises including squat jumps, plank to foot taps, lunge jumps, and burpees, which require a moderate level of coordination and some familiarity with exercise form. The mix of dynamic and static movements like plank variations and jumping movements categorize it largely into intermediate difficulty, albeit some movements like 'kick throughs' and 'plank jack' may lean slightly towards advanced, due to their requirement for coordination and core engagement.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Although the workout is structured to be low intensity compared to HIIT, continuous movement for 34 minutes with 45-second work intervals and little rest implies a moderate effort level, especially for beginners and less fit individuals. The array of cardio movements like high knees skip, burpees, and lunge jumps elevate the heart rate, contributing to the challenging classification for less fit individuals. However, the overall pace described as sustainable suggests it fits within moderate intensity for regular exercisers.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The metadata and comments suggest that while beginners can attempt this workout with modifications, it may be quite challenging and require frequent breaks. It's labeled as suitable for active rest days, implying moderate difficulty, aligning with an intermediate fitness level for those with some exercise experience. The indication from comments that some found it very taxing supports a higher classification for effort, placing it into advanced for certain aspects. However, the combination of sustained cardio and varied movements could accommodate a range of fitness levels, allowing beginners to approach at their own pace."
