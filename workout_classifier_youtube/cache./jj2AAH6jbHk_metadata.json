    "Not hyperbole: this video has changed my life. It\u2019s been nine years of horrible leg neuropathy pain, 25+ doctors, a useless surgery, tons of pain meds, etc., and in three days of doing this video, I am already LIGHT YEARS better. I feel like an idiot, but a grateful one, because it was so simple. All I can say is thank you.",
