  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty of this workout is rated as beginner with some intermediate aspects. The exercises listed (e.g., Knee Raises, Punches, Leg Kicks, Step Jacks) are simple movements requiring minimal coordination and balance, typically classifying them as beginner-level. The tags and description emphasize 'beginner lose weight' and 'easy to do workout', supporting the beginner classification. However, since users need to perform exercises such as Step Jacks and Walk Downs, which require slightly more coordination than static movements, there's a moderate alignment with the intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is predominantly light due to the workout's short duration (18:34) and low-impact nature (no jumping involved), making it suitable for those with joint concerns or low fitness levels. The description suggests it's a workout that can be done daily, indicating a lower intensity. Tags such as 'beginner workout' and feedback mentioning 'gentle but effective' signify a light effort. However, the comments and user feedback indicate some challenge with phrases like 'will push you to the limit' and 'I am tired', suggesting a secondary moderate effort for those less accustomed to exercise.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is primarily designed for beginners, as indicated by the tags and user comments referring to it as a 'beginner workout' and 'easy to do workout'. Its low-impact, no-jump design further confirms this. The presence of exercises requiring slightly more coordination aligns with an intermediate level, and several users noted feeling challenged, which suggests that those with minimal fitness might initially find it demanding. The advanced level is included due to the potential caloric burn if executed with higher intensity or cadence over time as mentioned in user comments."
