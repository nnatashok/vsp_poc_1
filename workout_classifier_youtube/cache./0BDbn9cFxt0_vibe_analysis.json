  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is highly aligned with \"The Comfort Moves\" vibe, scoring a 0.95 due to its explicit focus on prenatal-friendly exercise that is safe, gentle, and accommodating for various fitness levels. The title, description, and user comments emphasize a low-impact cardio routine, suitable for all trimesters, explicitly targeting pregnant viewers. This suggests a workout designed to be reassuring and supportive, evident in comments praising its ease and safety.\n\nAdditionally, \"The Reboot Workout\" vibe fits moderately, scoring 0.7, as the workout offers a total-body refresh suited for pregnant individuals. The use of standing exercises to gently elevate heart rates without stress supports this category. User comments describe it as a favorite pregnancy workout, highlighting its effective yet gentle approach. Though elements align with a refreshing workout, it lacks the deep stretch or relaxation focus typical of the category, explaining the moderate score.\n\nOther potential vibes, like \"The Zen Flow\" or \"The Meditative Grind,\" are excluded as this workout lacks grounding or repetitive meditative elements."
