  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this video is 'The Foundation Builder' (0.8). The title and description emphasize 'beginner' and 'no equipment,' indicating the focus on building foundational skills in calisthenics, which aligns with this vibe. The comments also reinforce this, with users expressing appreciation for making calisthenics accessible and helping them start from a novice level. The vibe 'The Comfort Moves' (0.65) is also applicable as the workout is accommodating and gentle enough for older users and those with past injuries, which fits with the goals of safety and accessibility. Finally, 'The Progression Quest' (0.4) has some relevance due to the methodical nature and incremental improvement associated with learning calisthenics and handstands, supported by the mention of follow-along and structured programs, such as the 3-day workout plan. However, the explicit focus on beginners and ease of entry makes this less central than the others. The chosen vibes reflect a high confidence level due to the clear indicators from both metadata and user feedback."
