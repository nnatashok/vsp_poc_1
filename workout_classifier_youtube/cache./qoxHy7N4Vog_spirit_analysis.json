  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit identified for this video is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a high confidence level of 0.8. This is based on the video's emphasis on pilates, a discipline that typically involves smooth and continuous movement patterns, enhancing the mind-body connection. Phrases like 'cardio flows' in the description and the channel's focus on dance-influenced pilates strengthen this classification.\n\nA secondary spirit, 'High-Energy & Intense,' is assigned with a score of 0.7. This is due to the workout's cardio element explicitly aiming to 'increase your heart rate' and comments about participants 'dripping with sweat' and finding the session 'challenging.' These elements indicate a vigorous, energetic quality consistent with high-intensity activity.\n\nOverall, the combination of pilates' structured flow and the intense cardio components present in the workout lead to these classifications. The tags and user comments provide strong supporting evidence, highlighting both the flow and intensity. Other spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Sport & Agility' were not selected due to a lack of emphasis on relaxation, recovery, or sports-specific skills in the metadata."
