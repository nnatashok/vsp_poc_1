  "spiritsExplanation": "The video, titled '10 Minute Cardio Workout at Home,' focuses on a quick cardiovascular workout designed to increase heart rate and burn calories. The description emphasizes its effectiveness despite being low impact with no jumping, suggesting a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit for maintaining high heart rates in a short burst, even with simpler movements. The tags reinforce this with mentions of 'high intensity' and 'weight loss.' These elements justify a score of 0.7 for 'High-Energy & Intense.' \n\nFurthermore, the workout is described as suitable for beginners and intermediates, and several comments highlight its simplicity and effectiveness, indicating the potential for 'Flow & Rhythm.' The use of rhythmic movement without jumping adds to the flow, albeit less intense than some fast-paced workouts. Thus, 'Flow & Rhythm' receives a score of 0.6.\n\nThe structured approach core to disciplines like Pilates influences the program, but due to the less systematic nature typical of brief cardio sessions, 'Structured & Disciplined' is less pronounced, and other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' aren\u2019t relevant here."
