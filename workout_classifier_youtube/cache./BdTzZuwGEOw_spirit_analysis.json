  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled \"20 Min Yoga Flow for Beginners\" is classified primarily under the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a score of 0.8. This classification is based on the explicit mention of a 'flow sequence' in the description, indicating continuous movement patterns, which is a hallmark of 'Flow & Rhythm'. Additionally, the use of 'vinyasa' in the tags supports this classification, as vinyasa yoga is known for its fluid transitions between poses.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant, scored at 0.7. The focus on beginners and the calming comments suggest a gentle, accessible approach that aids in relaxation and stress reduction, evidenced by a comment noting improved sleep. The moderate pace, as suggested by 'slowly than your traditional vinyasa', aligns with a soothing quality.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sports & Agility' are not applicable due to the lack of intensity and performance focus. The emphasis here is on inclusivity and mindfulness, which aligns predominantly with 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits."
