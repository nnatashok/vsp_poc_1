  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video explicitly states in the title and description that it is a 'No Equipment' workout. The title '30-Minute HIIT Cardio Workout with Warm Up - No Equipment at Home | SELF' makes it clear that no equipment is required. Additionally, the description reinforces this by mentioning bodyweight exercises such as high-knees, fast feet, star jumps, jumping lunges, and planks, all of which are typically performed without any equipment. The tags also emphasize this point with phrases like 'hiit no equipment' and 'bodyweight exercises'. Therefore, it is determined that this is a bodyweight-only workout, and no specific equipment is required."
