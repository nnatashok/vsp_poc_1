  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout uses High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which often involves basic to slightly complex movements, but the technique isn't highly technical or complex since it is based on a format like Les Mills which targets broad audiences. The video description does not list specific exercises that would indicate advanced movement patterns, suggesting the technique can be managed at an intermediate level with potential adaptations for beginners. Viewer comments also suggest that even younger participants find it approachable.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "HIIT workouts are typically challenging due to high-intensity intervals and minimal rest periods. The description and tags emphasize the intensity and reference terms like \"full body burn\" and \"intense,\" suggesting moderate to challenging effort is required. The 10-minute duration supports this, indicating a compact workout that demands significant effort in a short amount of time, consistent with HIIT principles.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the workout's technique and effort difficulty, this video is suitable for a range of fitness levels from Beginner to Advanced. The HIIT format suggests modifications possible for different levels, evidenced by comments indicating a variety of participant experiences from beginners trying other HIIT for a month to a younger audience attempting it. The combination of beginner and intermediate technique difficulty and a moderate to challenging effort level suggests inclusion of these fitness levels. The advanced level inclusion is based on the intensity of HIIT but beginners can attempt this with exercise modifications."
