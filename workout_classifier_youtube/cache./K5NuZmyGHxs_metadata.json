    "First day impressions:It arrived in a waist high box. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxP26Tir6n60vUkdtn4mbwhRO8cwuJQNy2\">https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxP26Tir6n60vUkdtn4mbwhRO8cwuJQNy2</a>  Each dumbbell was in its own foam box within the shipping box. Everything was secure and in good shape. No weird smells. The weight changing mechanism is really smooth and straight forward. Changing weight is really fast and easy. Though the handle is plastic, I don&#39;t think it will be breaking anytime soon. So far pretty impressed after my first session with them. I was afraid they were going to be too wide at first, but I didn&#39;t have any issues with them while doing upright rows.",
    "This was more mental than physical. Doing that swing and squat over and over again really pushed my mental limits. But overall, thanks for all these free mind blowing exercises, thank you very much.",
    "Wow \ud83d\ude05I\u2019m over 65yrs old and did I this routine from begging to end \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb I\u2019m so proud of what I can do at this age.  Thank you, thank you \ud83d\ude0a",
    "I have never been happier to see an ad on YouTube that I cannot skip\u2026.",
    "I\u2019ve done this workout a few times and every time it pushes me to the max. Both physical and mental. Great workout!"
