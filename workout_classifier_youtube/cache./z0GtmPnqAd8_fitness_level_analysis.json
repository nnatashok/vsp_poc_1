  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is characterized primarily as 'Beginner' due to the simple and straightforward nature of guided meditation, which typically requires minimal physical skill or coordination. The video description, tags, and comments all emphasize overcoming stress and anxiety through quiet and introspective practices, suggesting low complexity. A secondary score for 'Intermediate' is provided because meditation may require maintaining focus and posture, which could be slightly challenging for users not accustomed to the practice.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as 'Light,' reflecting the low physical energy expenditure associated with meditation.

The description and comments highlight its accessibility and focus on mental wellness rather than physical exertion. An additional 'Intermediate' score acknowledges that maintaining mental discipline and focus during meditation can pose slight challenges, particularly for those unaccustomed to lengthy concentration."
