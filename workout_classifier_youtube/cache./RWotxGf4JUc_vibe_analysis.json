  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified for this workout is 'The Zen Flow' due to the grounding, intentional, and breath-centered approach of the yoga session. The title and description emphasize 'full body morning stretch' and 'dynamic yoga flow,' indicating a focus on a calm, yet energizing morning routine. Keywords like 'boost your energy,' 'strength,' and 'flexibility' suggest a smooth and intentional flow typical of Zen-inspired sessions, supporting a score of 0.75.\n\n'Rhythmic Powerhouse' is another suitable vibe due to the inclusion of 'power yoga' in the tags and the mention of enhancing balance and recovery along with energy, which implies a beat-driven and fluid workout, justifying a score of 0.65.\n\nLastly, 'The Endorphin Wave' is considered with a score of 0.4. The video's effect of boosting morning energy hints at an elevated and feel-good experience, as noted in comments praising the invigorating impact of the session.\n\nOther potential vibes such as 'The Groove Session' or 'The Reboot Workout' were excluded due to the lack of emphasis on expressive movement or ultra-gentle stretching in the metadata."
