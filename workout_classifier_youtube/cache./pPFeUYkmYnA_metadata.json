    "Been working out for over 20 years. Have done weights for the most part. Then with the help of maturity I came to the conclusion about 2 or 3 years ago that there is absolutely no point focusing on stuff that sure can get you bigger but certainly won&#39;t help you run 1 km in less than 5 minutes, or get your arms and legs to support your own weight and more importantly develop your most used muscle \u2013 your heart \u2013 for it to be able to endure whatever possibly comes its way. Very good channel with excellent content Chris. I wish I had encountered such a motivational person while in my twenties. Hell, learning and practicing Muscle-ups and L-sits is no walk in the park at age 36, but I&#39;ll get there ;-)",
    "That vest is super dope.  You can tell a lot of thought went into the design.  It&#39;s not all big and bulky. It&#39;s lean AF just like Chris.  Looks like you can wear that ish all day \ud83d\udcaf"
