    "Team, we\u2019ve made it half way DAY 7 of 14 \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc Give your body this stretch to recover and get ready for new workouts coming next week woohoo <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamgrow\">#teamgrow</a> \u2764\u2764\u2764",
    "I\u2019m a 44 year old 6\u20191\u201d 277lbs. male. I started stretching first thing every morning  about 3 weeks ago. I\u2019ve used other videos until I found this one. I appreciate that there\u2019s no dialog to tire of. I like the transition beeps, along with the image of what\u2019s next and the time to get into position. I find it adequately challenging. I feel refreshed and ready for the day. Excellent video highly recommend!",
    "This is my absolute favorite stretch routine on the whole planet. After doing it I feel refreshed and my body is relieved.",
    "Slow rest days are just as important as the workouts. That\u2019s when our muscles grow \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc",
    "The auditory cues are a blessing. Tells me when i change stretches but also leave me enough time to look at what is next and see how she does it. The song choice is pop but calm ans perfect ans not too loud."
