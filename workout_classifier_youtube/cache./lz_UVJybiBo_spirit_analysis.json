  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata strongly indicates that the workout primarily embodies the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit. The title 'Guided Meditation For Positive Vibrations' explicitly suggests a focus on relaxation and mental well-being, which is a fundamental aspect of the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The description further reinforces this by highlighting terms such as 'stress-free,' 'anxiety-free,' and 'worry-free,' implying a focus on stress reduction and relaxation. The channel, Meditations By Gurudev, also specializes in meditation, emphasizing calmness and accessibility. The tags 'Meditation,' 'Peace,' and 'Mindfulness' and comments expressing gratitude for tranquility provide additional evidence for this classification. Given all this information, there's extremely high confidence (1.0) that the workout embodies a Soothing & Restorative spirit."
