  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as an 'Indoor biking' workout with a high confidence level and a score of 1.0. This is evident from the consistent use of terms related to spinning and indoor cycling across the title, tags, and description, such as 'spin class', 'cycling workout', 'indoor cycling', and 'spinning class'. The video's title explicitly mentions 'Spin Class' and the description reinforces this with details of a 'Spinning Workout'. \n\nAdditionally, a secondary classification as 'HIIT' is applicable due to the mention of 'Tabata', which is a specific form of high-intensity interval training, as seen in both the title and description. The presence of 'Tabata drills' suggests that this workout involves intervals of high-intensity, characteristic of HIIT workouts, hence the score of 0.7. \n\nThe channel's focus further supports these classifications, showcasing various workouts including spin and HIIT. Other categories like 'Weight workout' or 'Body weight' were considered but not selected due to lack of relevant keywords or descriptions pointing to such exercises."
