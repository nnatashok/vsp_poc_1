  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 48-minute HIIT session, which by nature involves high intensity and energy expenditure. Descriptions and user comments mention being drenched in sweat and the workout being 'brutal,' suggesting a significant physical demand. The 45-minute duration already elevates the effort level for less fit users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the workout's 48-minute duration and high-intensity HIIT format with weights, it requires a good base of cardiovascular fitness and some experience with resistance training (intermediate). The technique and effort difficulties being on the higher side suggest that beginners would struggle to complete this workout safely. User comments indicate that some users progressed from beginner to completing this level of workout, supporting an intermediate and advanced classification, with elite fit individuals finding it intense but manageable. The channel caters to multiple fitness levels, thereby fostering inclusivity but the workout specifics skew towards a more experienced audience."
