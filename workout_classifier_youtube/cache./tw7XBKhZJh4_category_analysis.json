  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Meditation' with a high confidence score of 1.0. The title and tags directly mention 'mindfulness meditation,' which explicitly aligns with the meditation category. Additionally, the description highlights this as a mindfulness-based practice, further solidifying this classification. Comments also reflect experiences characteristic of meditation, such as prolonged focus and relaxation, supporting this identification.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Breathing exercises' with a lower confidence score of 0.4. While not explicitly mentioned, meditation often involves controlled breathing techniques to facilitate mindfulness. This inference is drawn from the nature of the video and its mindfulness focus, although the primary evidence does not strongly emphasize breathing, hence the moderate confidence.\n\nOther categories were excluded as there is no mention of physical exercises, equipment, or movements beyond simple meditation techniques, indicating a clear focus on mental and mindful practices."
