  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled \"Guided Meditation with Mooji \u2014 Just Be!\" suggests a clear focus on relaxation, presence, and spiritual introspection. The term 'guided meditation' naturally aligns with the Soothing & Restorative spirit as it emphasizes a tranquil and calming experience. The description further supports this by highlighting phrases like 'the natural state of Beingness,' 'non-dual Awareness,' and advises viewers to \"stay empty, consciously,\" which implies a restful and meditative approach. This spirit is further corroborated by tags such as 'peace,' 'awareness,' 'bliss,' and 'surrender,' which are consistent with restorative practices aimed at stress reduction and mental clarity. There is no indication of high-energy activity or structured physical exercise, excluding other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined.' Given the evidence, the classification confidence is very high at 0.9, and the score for Soothing & Restorative is perfect at 1.0, indicating that the content is a quintessential match for this spirit."
