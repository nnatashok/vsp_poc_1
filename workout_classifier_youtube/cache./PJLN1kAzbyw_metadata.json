    "The gentleness was actually true to form for me! Sometimes I encounter \u201cgentle\u201d or \u201cbeginner\u201d workouts that feel inaccessible to me. This was such a great help!",
    "I started today, ill try doing Pilates more often. What I wanted to say is, this video is actually beginner-friendly, usually they make 20-min videos that make you question your existence.",
    "I know this video is from two-years ago, but I wanted to tell you thank you. I have a few autoimmune diseases that affect my bones, joints and tendons. Today is a hurting day, but I didn&#39;t want to skip doing Pilates as I&#39;m just newly beginning. I&#39;ve done a few of your beginner classes aside from this. Your descriptive teaching is amazing, and your calm voice is soothing making your classes relaxing yet a nice workout. This video/class felt great on my joints, and I can&#39;t thank you enough.",
    "Great instructions! I have trouble with a pelvic tilt and this helped me scoop in my core and improve my posture! Thanks!",
    "Omg this flow instantly lifted my mood! Very gentle yet effective. Thank you!"
