  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled '45' RIDE - Who Runs The World' strongly embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, scoring 0.8. This is primarily supported by its classification as a 'spin class', which typically involves high-intensity cardiovascular workouts, as well as the description that includes 'full body workouts' and 'cardio'. The comments support this with references to getting the right mindset for endurance sports and pushing heart rates to the limit. Additionally, the workout cues a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a score of 0.6. This is evidenced by the use of music, as noted in one of the comments highlighting enjoyment from the music and motivation. The channel\u2019s focus on fitness and positive viewer feedback about the instructor\u2019s energy and motivation underscore this analysis. There is no evidence to support a 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' classification, thus they are excluded."
