  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is assigned with a score of 0.9 due to the nature of the workout described. The title clearly indicates a 'Quick & Effective HIIT' session, which is synonymous with high-intensity interval training that involves maximum effort and energy expenditure. This spirit is further reinforced by the description noting 'max effort sprinting or running' and the workout's goal to 'boost your metabolism' and 'push your limits.' These elements strongly indicate a high-energy, intense workout.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit scores 0.7 due to the precise format of the workout session. The workout is methodically structured with an 8-round format, each consisting of 30-second high-intensity intervals followed by 90-second rest periods, as well as clearly defined warm-up and cool-down phases. These elements highlight a disciplined approach to following a specific interval training protocol.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were not applicable due to the absence of continuous, smooth movement or a primary focus on relaxation. The outdoor context is not relevant here, as the workout is treadmill-based."
