  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Absolute Beginner Bodyweight Workout (No Weights, No Jumping)' by Joanna Soh explicitly states in both the title and description that no weights or jumping are involved. The description emphasizes that the workout focuses on simple beginner exercises targeting major muscle groups using bodyweight only, with no mention of any specific equipment needed. The circuits described include exercises like squats, lunges, push-ups, and planks, which are all typically performed without any equipment. The tags and channel description support the emphasis on beginner, home-based, and bodyweight exercises. Therefore, the equipment classification concludes that no equipment is required, and the workout is bodyweight only."
