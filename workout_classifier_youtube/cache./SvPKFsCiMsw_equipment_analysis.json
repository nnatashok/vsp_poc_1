  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video focuses on a yoga workout for stiff bodies, as indicated by the title '10 Minute Yoga Full Body Stretch for Stiff Bodies' and numerous tags such as 'yoga,' 'full body stretch,' and 'yoga for stiff bodies.' The description promotes this as a gentle yoga class, which typically involves floor exercises. Furthermore, in the description under 'Yoga Essentials,' a 'Yoga Mat' is explicitly recommended with a link provided for purchase. This suggests that a mat is considered essential for comfort and stability during the practice, leading to a high confidence score of 0.9 for the requirement of a mat. There is no mention of other specific equipment, and the presence of a yoga mat aligns with standard yoga practices for floor activities."
