  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled 'INTENSE 10 MINUTE FAT MELTING HIIT CARDIO WORKOUT [10 SECOND BREAKS],' which suggests a high-intensity interval training session focusing on cardio. The description reinforces that this is an at-home workout aimed at burning calories and melting fat, with no specific equipment mentioned for performing the exercises. Additionally, the metadata highlights the terms 'at home,' 'no repeat exercise,' and 'no repeating movements,' which imply a bodyweight workout with exercises that can be performed without any special equipment. Although a 'YOGA Mats' link is given, there is no direct mention that a mat is necessary for the workout. Instead, the mention of using a towel on a hardwood surface suggests its optional use for comfort rather than a requirement for the exercises themselves. Therefore, this workout appears to be bodyweight only, with no equipment explicitly required or implied beyond optional comfort items like a towel."
