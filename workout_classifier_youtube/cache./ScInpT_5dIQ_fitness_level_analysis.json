  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout focuses on compound movements such as chest press, static lunges, shoulder press, and bent over row, which are typically classified as intermediate in technique difficulty due to their demand for coordination and proper form to avoid injury. The use of dumbbells adds complexity due to the need for balance and unilateral work (one side at a time). Additionally, movements like staggered RDLs require good balance and body awareness. However, the exercises are largely at a standard tempo with full range of motion, suggesting they are not overly complex. Therefore, a score of 0.7 for Intermediate and 0.5 for Advanced is warranted.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 38 minutes long, indicating it's likely to be more demanding. Each exercise is performed for 60 seconds with only 20 seconds rest, which increases cardiovascular strain and muscular endurance demands. The inclusion of a 3-minute nonstop ab finisher adds to the energy expenditure. The use of significant weights (17.5kg dumbbells) elevates the intensity. Based on the duration and intensity mentioned, the effort difficulty is rated as Moderate to Challenging, with a score of 0.6 for Moderate and 0.7 for Challenging.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the intermediate to advanced level in technique difficulty and the moderate to challenging effort required, the workout is best suited for intermediate to advanced fitness levels. An intermediate might manage through self-selected weights and pacing, while those more advanced can handle the higher weights and minimal rest periods. The community commentary also suggests a level of difficulty aligning with these levels, as users who doubled their weights after months of training felt significant burn. Thus, Intermediate is scored at 0.7, and Advanced at 0.6."
