  "title": "30 Minutes Workout - Virtual Scenery - Treadmill / Exercise Machine (Cotswolds UK) 1080/60fps",
  "description": "Treadmill? Exercise bike? Cross trainer? Rowing machine? Flying carpet? Beat the boredom with a virtual tour around the picturesque Hobbit Shires of Gloucester and the Cotswolds, while you work out for a full 30 minutes.  SEE NOTES BELOW REGARDING SPEED...\nThe music was made by me and I acknowledge not to everyone's tastes, so do feel free to mute and use your own music :o)\n(Best enjoyed at full 1080p @ 60 frames per second)\n\nSPEED NOTES:  I've had some feedback comments regarding the speed of the video not being \"realistic\" and not accurately representing running or walking. Before publishing, I experimented creating the video at various jogging or cycling speeds, but found with the slower speeds, the visuals got tedious very quickly.  \n\nIn the end I settled for real-time driving speed which provides sufficient changes of scenery to keep the visuals interesting, bearing in mind most people will be using this video as a distraction from the tedium of exercise anyway. The faster speed also allows you to see much more of the area than you would do at slower speeds.  :o)",

    "Turned 70 last year and decided I needed more exercise so invested in an exercise bike and now enjoy travelling the world on it.Thank you.",
    "My workout this morning. This  80 year old doesn&#39;t feel so hemmed in due to the current virus situation, with videos like this. Thanks.",
    "On the 15th passing anniversary of my lovely British husband, I am on my treadmill sharing this run through the Cotswolds with his spirit since we never experienced it, together.  I miss him like the sun...Miss you, Philip...",
    "Fighting off depression by trying to just get out of bed - this had the perfect amount of trees and beautiful countryside to make getting on my stationary bike actually worthwhile.  Thank you SO MUCH for this.  It&#39;s going to be a delightful habit... and I&#39;m going to make it one by blogging about it.  :)   At first the speed felt a little hectic but then I made an effort to just enjoy it for what it was, and it turned out to be quite nice.  Thank you again - now my brain is woken up enough to start studying for the day!  :)",
    "I love this! I&#39;m a 70 year old grandma and during my younger days, running has helped me a lot. In 2007, I joined the Annual Army 10 Miler Run in Washinton DC where I used to work. I was 58 years old. I finished the run in 2 hours 44 minutes. Now at my age, I only hit my treadmill with your video to keep me healthy. Awesome!! Thanks a lot!"
