  "description": "A gentle Breathe and Flow yoga routine for better sleep - yoga for sleep.

    "I don&#39;t know if you guys check comments on old videos. But I wanted to let you know this video has been my almost nightly companion for the last four years. Flo your calming voice and this gentle routine have created the perfect atmosphere for winding down and is an essential component of my night routine. I truly believe this video has significantly improved my sleep on countless occasions, and I can&#39;t imagine my nights without it. I would be truly heartbroken if it was ever taken down from the platform. Thank you so much for creating such a valuable resource. Namaste.",
