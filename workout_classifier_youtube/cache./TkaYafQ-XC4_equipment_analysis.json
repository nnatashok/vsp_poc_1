  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video's title explicitly states \"No Equipment,\" indicating that the workout is designed to be performed without any additional tools. The exercises listed in the description\u2014such as high knees, lunge jumps, press-ups, toe touches, and mountain climbers\u2014are all bodyweight exercises that typically do not require any equipment. Additionally, the comments and tags do not mention or imply any need for equipment to complete the workout. Therefore, it can be concluded with very high confidence (0.8-1.0) that no equipment is needed. This workout is purely bodyweight based."
