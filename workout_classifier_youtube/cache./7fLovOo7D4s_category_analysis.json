  "categoriesExplanation": "This video is categorized primarily as 'Walking' with a high score of 0.8. This decision is based on several explicit and implicit indicators: the title mentions \"800 Steps\", which directly relates to a stepping or walking workout. Additionally, tags like 'Walking Workout' and comments such as 'micro walking workout' and 'Let's WALK, DANCE, TONE & FLOW UP TO THE BEAT!' from the channel description strengthen this conclusion.\n\nNext, the 'Mat' category was considered, scoring 0.6, given the reference to 'Dance Workout'. The channel promotes 'small STEPS' through varied workouts, suggesting minimal equipment or mat-based routines. Phrases in the metadata such as 'dance that walk' and 'Dance' in the channel's description also imply a dance-style workout typically performed on a floor mat.\n\nFinally, 'HIIT' was given a lower score of 0.4 due to mentions of 'Fat Burner' and 'Cardio HIIT workout', although the intensity and brief duration suggest this is more of a light or Low-Intensity Interval Training (LIIT). Hence, HIIT is considered but with moderate confidence due to ambiguous categorization of the workout\u2019s intensity and structure."
