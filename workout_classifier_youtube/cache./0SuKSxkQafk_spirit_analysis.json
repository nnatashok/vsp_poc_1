  "spiritsExplanation": "The video metadata strongly indicates a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is derived from the explicit mention of 'Beginners Marathon Training' and 'Interval Training' in both the title and tags, suggesting a systematic approach to building running capability. Additionally, the mention of 'spartan training' in the description and the focus on increasing speed imply a disciplined regimen.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit scores 0.6 due to elements like 'How to run faster,' 'Interval Training,' and 'Run faster,' suggesting segments that elevate intensity and challenge the cardiovascular system. Although the primary audience is beginners, the workout is still described as 'long,' indicating a significant physical demand which aligns with the high-energy spirit.\n\nNot selected was 'Flow & Rhythm,' as the workout appears more structured than fluid. 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to the focus on treadmill use and lack of recovery emphasis. Comments show enthusiasm for longer sessions but lack specific mentions that would alter the primary spirits."
