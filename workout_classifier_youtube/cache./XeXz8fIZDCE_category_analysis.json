  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Yoga' with a very high confidence (0.95). The title 'Yoga For Lower Back Pain | Yoga With Adriene' explicitly mentions yoga, which is further reinforced by the repetitive mention of 'yoga' in the tags such as 'yoga for back pain', 'yoga for low back pain', and 'yoga for flexibility'. The description also highlights a yoga sequence specifically designed for lower back pain, which aligns with the channel's focus on yoga content. The comments strongly support the yoga aspect, with users discussing their experiences with the yoga video.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Stretching' with a moderate presence (0.6) since the video includes elements like 'sciatica stretches' and 'yoga for flexibility' as per the tags. The description mentions following the yoga sequence with a 'gentle cobra stretch', which indicates a focus on flexibility and stretches as part of the routine. However, the dominant theme throughout all metadata is yoga, justifying the higher confidence and score for the 'Yoga' category."
