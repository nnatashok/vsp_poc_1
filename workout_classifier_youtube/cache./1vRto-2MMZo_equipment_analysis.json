  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled \"15 MIN DANCE PARTY WORKOUT - Full Body/No Equipment,\" which clearly indicates that no equipment is needed. The tags repeatedly mention 'no equipment' and 'dance workout,' emphasizing that this is a bodyweight-only, dance-based cardio routine. The description supports this by describing the workout as a 'full body DANCE cardio routine,' focusing on dance moves to music from artists like Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna. Despite a link to purchase a mat in the description, this is part of general gear promotion and not specific to this workout. Therefore, no equipment is required for this session, and it is designed to be performed with just body movements to music."
