  "description": "Subscribe to GCN Training: https://gcn.eu/GCNTraining\n\nIn association with Elite & Alta Badia.\n\nThis indoor cycling workout will help you to improve your VO2 max and overall cycling fitness. We rode the tough but picturesque Passo Pordoi in Alta Badia in the Dolomites.\n\nGCN Winter Sale - Up To 50% Off: https://gcn.eu/17L\nSubscribe to GCN: http://gcn.eu/SubscribeToGCN\nRegister your interest in the GCN Club: https://gcn.eu/17K\n\nThanks to Business As Usual, Bristol for the location.\n\nThis indoor cycling workout is definitely not easy but will get you fit very quickly. As with these VO2 Max sessions, it's not advised you do this more than twice per week as otherwise, your intensity may suffer and you won't be able to reach the desired power output. The efforts will mostly last two minutes, featuring some torque style efforts thrown in too. 6 sets of 2 min, broken down into 30s seated, 30s out of the saddle attack, back in the saddle and then one last attack before 3 min recovery.  \n\nIf you try this workout, be sure to comment below and let us know how you get on.\n\nSubmit your content with our new uploader: http://gcn.eu/upload\nJoin our Facebook community: http://gcn.eu/FBCommunity \n\nNot all exercises are suitable for everyone - there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach. As with any strenuous exercise, you should take into account factors such as your flexibility, strength and overall health to determine if an exercise is appropriate for you, and consult a doctor/physician before beginning a programme of exercise.

    "Here I go again!  Great session as I prepare for another season of outdoor cycling.  71 years and counting!  Thanks, James.",
    "This workout video is still GCNs best.  Please create more like it. Two fun trainers, virtual ride outside.",
    "We tackled assembling the bike as a family project. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxzg0clhbtRf2gGxPkVETFKJJKGqdsorQu\">https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxzg0clhbtRf2gGxPkVETFKJJKGqdsorQu</a>  The package is heavy, but I have 2 teen boys that were able to move it. The written instructions were great- we didn&#39;t need to watch the videos, but it was good knowing that the option was there if we needed it. After we were able to get it set up, the boys each rode 3 miles and I rode 8 and the bike stayed quiet. The display is easy to reset, and you can put it on whichever setting you are using (time, distance, calories, etc). I will say that my butt is a little sore from the seat, but that could be because I haven&#39;t rode in a while. While it is comfortable for me, it was not comfortable with the seat position for my friend (could not move the seat back far enough and he slightly looked like a kid riding a tricycle that he had outgrown). He also said that the seat hurt his manly parts. We are going to look for a different seat that will be compatible with this bike for him.I did purchase the Wahoo Cadence sensor and strapped it to the crank of one of the pedals. This will sync with my Apple Watch, iPhone and will import data in to my Health app. Wahoo does have other sensors available other than cadence. I can also keep either my phone or my iPad on the display and they both feel pretty secure.",
    "After many years, i still come back to this one. Hate it, love it \ud83d\ude02",
    "Having them talk throughout the workout makes you feel you&#39;re not training alone, really helps mentally when you are trying to lose weight. awesome videos GCN"
