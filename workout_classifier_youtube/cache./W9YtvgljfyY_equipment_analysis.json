  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video '10-Minute Guided Stretching Routine for Runners' appears to be a bodyweight-only routine based on the available metadata. The title, description, and tags focus on static stretching specifically for runners, with no mention of any equipment being used. The mention of focusing on 'hip flexibility' and targeting 'tight areas' suggests traditional floor stretching exercises, typically done without any equipment. The comments section further reinforces this, as users discuss their improvements in flexibility without referencing any equipment. Moreover, the channel's focus on Pilates, mobility, and functional strength through proper form does not imply a need for additional tools for this specific stretching routine. Therefore, it is classified as requiring no equipment."
