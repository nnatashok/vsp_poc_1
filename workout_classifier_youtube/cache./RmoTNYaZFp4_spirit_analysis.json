  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled '20 Minute Full Body Stretch | Deep Stretch for Total Body' is best classified under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to its focus on gentle, deep stretching routines aimed at making participants 'feel SO GOOD.' The emphasis on relaxation is evident from the description and workout overview which includes various stretching exercises like 'Cobra,' 'Quadriceps Stretch,' and 'Seated Hamstring Stretch.' These activities are typically associated with relaxation and stress reduction, justifying a high score of 0.9 for the soothing nature.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is given a lower score of 0.3, recognizing the structured transition between stretches that might exhibit some smoothness and rhythm. However, the primary focus remains on restorative qualities rather than continuous, coordinated movement patterns. \n\nNo evidence suggests high-energy, structured, sports, or outdoor elements, thus other spirits were excluded. The feedback about the desire for less talking to connect mentally supports the restorative focus, although it indicates a slight potential to enhance the mind-body connection aspect characteristic of Flow & Rhythm."
