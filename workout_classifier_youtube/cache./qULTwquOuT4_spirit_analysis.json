  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video \"BEGINNER FLEXIBILITY ROUTINE (Stretches for the Inflexible)\" primarily embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a score of 0.9. This is evident from the focus on increasing flexibility and the repeated emphasis on stretches designed for beginners or individuals considered inflexible. Such sessions are typically more relaxed and intended to aid in recovery and stress reduction, aligning closely with the restorative nature. The description reinforces this by inviting anyone in need of a 'great stretch,' which suggests a recovery and soothing focus.\n\nThe secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm,' is present with a moderate score of 0.4. This inference draws from \"follow along\" tags, signaling guided, continuous movement patterns that might suggest a rhythmic flow, albeit gentle, suitable for beginners. However, the key focus remains predominantly on relaxation and flexibility improvement over the rhythmic and coordinated movement, warranting a lower confidence in this spirit.\n\nPotential spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the video's non-intensive, beginner-friendly, and less regimented approach to stretching. Overall, the metadata strongly indicates a session aiming to relax and enhance flexibility gently."
