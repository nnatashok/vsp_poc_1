  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled 'Daily Breathing Exercises in 12 Minutes' and explicitly focuses on breathing exercises for health and wellness. The description emphasizes that no special equipment is needed, mentioning 'You don't need any special equipment or a lot of time\u2014just 12 minutes a day.' Additionally, the tags emphasize breathing and yoga, which reinforces the idea that this is a practice centered on breath control and mindfulness rather than physical exercise requiring equipment. Therefore, this workout appears to be bodyweight only, and no equipment is necessary to perform the breathing exercises described in the video."
