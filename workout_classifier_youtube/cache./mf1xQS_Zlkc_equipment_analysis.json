  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled '20 Minute Full Body Dumbbell Workout NO REPEAT', which explicitly mentions the use of dumbbells, giving a very high confidence that dumbbells are central to the workout (confidence score: 1.0). The description further supports this by stating 'All you need is a light or moderate weight pair of dumbbells.' This reinforces that dumbbells are required for completing the workout effectively. \n\nAdditionally, the description mentions needing a 'soft surface', which implies the use of a mat for comfort during exercises performed on the floor. While a mat is not explicitly stated, it is commonly used for workouts involving ground contact or as a surface for core exercises, leading to a high confidence that a mat is recommended (confidence score: 0.7). Overall, the equipment identified is aligned with the workout's structure and the common practice for similar routines."
