  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the workout is 'Soothing & Restorative,' as indicated by terms such as 'deep relaxation,' 'full body stretch,' and 'yin inspired yoga class,' which suggest a gentle, recovery-focused session. The description emphasizes 'releasing tension and promoting relaxation,' supporting a restorative nature. Moreover, user comments reflect emotional release and comfort experienced during the session, strengthening this classification with a high score of 0.9. \n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a score of 0.6. Although the practice focuses on stretching, it likely involves a sequence of movements typical in yoga that align with breathing and rhythm, as inferred from yoga's inherent flow elements. The inclusion of phrases like 'yin inspired yoga class' implies a continuous flow suitable for such a spirit.\n\nThe exclusion of spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' is due to the absence of terms indicating vigorous activity or athletic training in the metadata."
