  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Ultimate Relaxation - Breathing Exercise' predominantly reflects the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is supported by the emphasis on relaxation, stress relief, and improvement of mental well-being as stated in the description and tags such as 'relieve stress', 'stress relief', and 'reset nervous system'. The approach is gentle and healing-focused, further confirmed by user comments noting a calming effect and better sleep.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is detected with a moderate score of 0.7 due to the use of continuous breath cycles described in the video. Terms like 'Deep Circular Breaths', and a structured progression through breath-hold times suggest a rhythm and flow in the breathing technique. User comments describe energy pulses and relaxation, highlighting a mind-body connection. Other spirits were not applicable as there is no substantial focus on high energy/intensity, athleticism, or outdoor elements in the metadata provided."
