  "vibesExplanation": "This workout strongly embodies 'The Zen Flow' vibe, with a score of 0.9, due to its focus on chakra balancing and emotional, spiritual, and physical equilibrium. The use of calming and intentional phrases in the description, such as 'soothing guidance', 'rejuvenating your energy centers', and 'reconnect with your inner self', all point to a grounding, breath-centered experience typical of a Zen Flow. The presence of terms like 'chakra balance' and 'cleansing' in both the title and tags further support this classification. The comment section emphasizes the peaceful and calming aspects of the meditation, reinforcing this vibe.\n\n'\"The Deep Recharge\" also fits with a moderate score of 0.75, focusing on nervous system resets through cleansing and rejuvenating energy centers, suggesting a total-body refresh. The mentions of 'holistic well-being' and 'profound sense of clarity' indicate a restorative nature.\n\n'\"The Sleep Prep\" has a slight match at 0.3, as the meditation could prepare individuals for rest by reducing stress, though this is not explicitly stated. This video does not match more dynamic vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter', as it is neither intense nor energetic."
