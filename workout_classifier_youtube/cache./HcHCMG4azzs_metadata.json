    "Fantastic video. I used to have such negative feelings towards exercise because of being bullied at school in particular in PE classes it put me off for a long time. After finding you I feel like I can get back into it it feels like a safe space for me with no judgements only encouragement and a smile . Thanks Rachael for doing this we all appreciate it \u2764",
