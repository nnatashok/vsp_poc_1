  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is classified as Intermediate due to the focus on Pilates, which often involves attention to detail, control, and coordination. The description explicitly states 'Intermediate level,' suggesting movements require a moderate amount of skill beyond basic exercises. Additionally, comments reflect that users had to pause and rest, indicating exercises might require some coordination. The lack of equipment and focus on mat Pilates implies exercises that are more about maintaining form and control rather than performing highly complex movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is assessed as Moderate. The workout is 'Low impact,' suggesting it's not highly intense but still requires a significant physical effort over the course of a 15-minute duration. Comments indicate that users found the session challenging, needing to rest, which supports a moderate level of effort. However, it remains a Pilates session, which generally focuses more on muscle engagement and endurance rather than high energy expenditure. The workout duration is under 20 minutes, aligning with a moderate classification for energy expenditure.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Multiple fitness levels are included due to variations in user experience with Pilates and overall fitness levels. The description indicates an Intermediate level, but the short duration and lack of equipment allow for inclusion of beginners, especially those willing to pause as needed. Beginners might find the workout moderately challenging but doable. Intermediate users align with the description, and Advanced users might partake for maintenance or additional precision in form. User comments about difficulty and needing breaks showcase variable responses, further supporting a wide range of applicable fitness levels."
