  "categoriesExplanation": "The video strongly fits into the 'Indoor biking' category, as evidenced by tags such as 'spin class', 'indoor cycling workout', and 'stationary bike workout', with a high score of 0.95 due to the clear focus on a spin class. The mention of 'tabata' in both the title and description indicates a 'HIIT' (High-Intensity Interval Training) format, which is reinforced by the described workout routine of '8 x 20s ON/10s OFF'. This alternating intensity pattern is characteristic of HIIT, justifying a score of 0.9. The video is a short, high-intensity session intended as a 'finisher', aligning with both the intensity and supplementary nature of HIIT workouts. Other categories such as 'Mat', 'Weight workout', or 'Stretching' are excluded due to the clear focus on cycling and interval training, with high confidence levels given the explicit descriptors and metadata indications."
