  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit classification for this workout is 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.8. This choice is strongly supported by specific details in the metadata, such as the reference to it being a 'routine', 'protocols for progressions', and 'technique tips,' all indicating a methodical and progressive training structure. The use of terms like 'calisthenics skills' and 'bodyweight strength' further underline a disciplined approach focused on building strength through technical precision.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.6. The video is described as a 'follow along' workout, which often entails a smooth, continuous exercise routine that requires coordination and rhythm. Additionally, the workout's aim to boost 'strength and mobility' supports a focus on fluid, cohesive movement patterns.\n\nThe absence of indications such as high intensity or outdoor elements, along with the structured comments about routine and progress, ruled out other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Outdoor & Adventure.' Overall, the classification is made with high confidence based on the clear cues provided."
