  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a low-impact Pilates-based routine. Pilates often requires some body awareness and control but is generally accessible to beginners, especially when termed 'low impact.' The exercises suggested (cardio and abs) typically involve straightforward movements. Therefore, the technique difficulty is rated as Beginner to Intermediate with higher emphasis on Intermediate due to the Pilates elements that require coordination and core engagement.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout emphasizes 'low impact' activities, which indicates lower cardiovascular stress and energy expenditure, suitable for less conditioned users. However, as it combines cardio and abdominal exercises in a continuous 23-minute session, it will likely demand moderate effort, especially for beginners. Tags such as 'low impact cardio' and 'cardio pilates' alongside the 23:45 duration suggest the effort required is more than light but remains accessible, reflecting a Light to Moderate effort difficulty.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Combining low-impact cardio with Pilates suggests the workout can be suitable for a wide range of fitness levels. Beginners may find it slightly challenging but achievable, particularly since it's identified as 'low impact.' Intermediate and advanced users can focus on enhancing technique and endurance. The workout duration of over 20 minutes nudges it more toward Intermediate, but by including modifications or pacing, beginners can engage with it. Hence, the required fitness level spans Beginner to Advanced, mainly focussing on Intermediate, given the Pilates components and session length."
