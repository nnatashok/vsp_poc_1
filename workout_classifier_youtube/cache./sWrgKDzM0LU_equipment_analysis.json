  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Guided Mindfulness Meditation for the Morning: Starting the Day (15 minutes)' is focused on a mindfulness meditation session, as indicated by the title, description, and tags such as 'meditation', 'mindful', 'peace', and 'calm'. There is no mention or implication of the need for physical fitness equipment such as mats or resistance bands. The video seems to be an auditory meditation guide intended for mindfulness practice, which typically does not require any fitness equipment. Instead, it recommends listening on headphones first thing in the morning. This supports the conclusion that no traditional workout equipment is needed for this meditation. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, involving no physical exercise equipment."
