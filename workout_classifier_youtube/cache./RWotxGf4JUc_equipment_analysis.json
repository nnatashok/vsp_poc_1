  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The primary equipment needed for this workout is a mat, with very high confidence (0.8), because the description strongly suggests rolling out your mat to begin the session. The video is specifically a yoga routine ('15 Min Yoga for Men'), and mats are standard for such activities to provide comfort and stability during floor exercises. No other equipment is mentioned in the title, description, tags, or comment section, implying that the workout is likely designed to be performed with just a yoga mat. The channel is known for bodyweight workouts that generally don't require additional equipment beyond the mat for yoga sessions."
