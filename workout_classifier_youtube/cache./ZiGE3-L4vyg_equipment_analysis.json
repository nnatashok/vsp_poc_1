  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is explicitly designed as an indoor cycling workout, as indicated by the title \"HIIT Indoor Cycling Workout\" and supported by the channel's focus on cycling content. The description mentions using a road bike on a turbo trainer, on rollers, or an indoor bike specifically for this workout, which confirms that an exercise bike is central to the routine. Tags such as \"spin\", \"indoor cycling\", and \"spinning class\" further affirm the necessity of cycling equipment. Hence, the confidence score for the exercise bike is very high, at 0.9, because the workout cannot be done effectively without it."
