  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for this video centers around a \"15 minute Full Body Strength Workout with Dumbbells\" which explicitly indicates that dumbbells are necessary for the workout. Both the title and tags, such as \"dumbbell strength workout\" and \"full body dumbbell workout,\" reinforce the requirement of dumbbells, justifying a very high confidence score of 1.0. The description further confirms this by promoting the session as a \"full body dumbbell strength workout,\" which supports the consistent emphasis on using dumbbells throughout the video."
