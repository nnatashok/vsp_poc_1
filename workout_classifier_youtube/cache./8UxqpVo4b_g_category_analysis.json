  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Calisthenics,' with a high confidence level of 0.95 due to multiple explicit indicators. The title, tags, and description repeatedly mention 'calisthenics.' Specifically, phrases like 'beginner calisthenics workout,' 'calisthenics routine,' and various tags such as 'best calisthenics workout,' 'calisthenics beginner workout' strongly emphasize this exercise type. Additionally, the channel name 'The Bodyweight Process' suggests a focus on bodyweight training primarily associated with calisthenics.\n\nThe 'Body weight' category is also appropriate, scoring 0.7, as calisthenics workouts fundamentally involve exercises using one's body weight for resistance. The description references mastering 'compound movements' which are typically bodyweight exercises in calisthenics.\n\n'Other' is included with a score of 0.3 to account for potential exercise variations or alternatives provided in the description, such as adjustments for those without park access, which may include non-standard calisthenics exercises like using rings. This inclusion captures any additional elements not fitting classic categories from the list. The high view and like ratio, along with positive comments, indicate a quality and engaging content that aligns well with the calisthenics and body weight categories."
