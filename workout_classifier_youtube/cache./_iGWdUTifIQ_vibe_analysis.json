  "vibesExplanation": "The video 'Guided Meditation for Inner Peace and Calm | Mindful Movement' is characterized primarily by 'The Zen Flow' vibe, scoring a high 0.95. This is due to its focus on grounding, intentional, and breath-centered practices, as indicated by terms like 'calm,' 'peace,' and 'unconditional love.' The mention of a guided process to 'nurture yourself with unconditional love and compassion' supports a very high confidence in this classification.\n\nThe second vibe, 'The Deep Recharge,' scores 0.85. The description and tags like 'relaxation,' 'stress reduction,' and 'letting go of negativity' align well with the notion of resetting the nervous system through gentle movement and meditation.\n\nLastly, 'The Mindful Walk' is considered with a moderate score of 0.5 due to the immersive and meditative nature of the walk-like journey through personal emotions and thoughts suggested by phrases like 'guided meditation' and 'curious about what you are feeling.' However, this vibe is less strong because there is no actual physical walk involved. The confidence level for these vibes is high, given the explicit intention and style of meditation promoted both in the video and channel description."
