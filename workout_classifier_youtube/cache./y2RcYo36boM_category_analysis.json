  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Pilates' with a high confidence score of 1.0. This classification is based on multiple explicit mentions in the title, description, and tags, such as 'EXPRESS PILATES WORKOUT', 'Beginner to Moderate Pilates', and 'pilates workout 20 minutes'. The channel owner, Nicole, is a certified Pilates instructor, which further supports this categorization. Additionally, the metadata indicates the use of a mat for the workout, as seen in the description's mention of a mat from Liforme and the tag 'at-home pilates workout', suggesting floor-based exercises. This justifies the inclusion of 'Mat' as a secondary category with a score of 0.7. No evidence suggests the involvement of other equipment or exercise styles beyond Pilates, hence other categories are excluded."
