  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for this video strongly indicates the use of an indoor bike as a key piece of equipment. The title ('High Intensity Hill Climb Training') and description highlight this is a cycling workout. The tags such as 'indoor cycling', 'turbo trainer', 'gym bike', and 'high intensity interval training' further support this. The description explicitly states the workout is 'ideal for an indoor bike, a turbo trainer or smart trainer' and replicates a hill climb session. These clues suggest that an exercise bike is central to performing the workout effectively, leading to a high confidence score of 0.9."
