  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category, 'Breathing exercises', is evident from the title and tags which mention terms such as 'Guided Alkaline DMT Breathing', 'guided breathwork', 'dmt breathing', 'breathing exercises', and others. This suggests a strong focus on breath control techniques, justifying the high confidence score of 0.95.\n\nThe secondary category, 'Meditation', is considered due to references to 'DMT breathwork meditation' and 'dmt meditation' in the tags. Although meditation is not explicitly mentioned in the video description or title, the nature of guided breathing often aligns with meditative practices, supporting a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nThe 'Other' category is included with a low score of 0.3 to account for any elements that don't fit well into traditional exercise categories, such as the mention of 'psychedelic breathing' and 'holotropic breathwork', which may encompass unique or non-standard practices not covered by conventional categories.\n\nThe confidence in these classifications is high due to clear and multiple indicators in the metadata pointing toward structured breathing exercises and meditative elements."
