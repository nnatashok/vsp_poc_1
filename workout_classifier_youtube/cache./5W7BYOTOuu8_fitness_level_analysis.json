  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'low impact, high intensity' and aims to 'raise your heart rate, burn fat, and tone muscles,' suggesting a considerable energy expenditure. The video is nearly 55 minutes long, exceeding the 40-minute threshold that decreases suitability for beginners and indicates increased physical demand. Comments from users who 'love' doing the workout suggest it's impactful and engaging but potentially demanding.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the intermediate technique difficulty and challenging effort level, this workout would suit intermediate users, especially as it requires coordination and involves a significant cardio component over an extended duration. It also fits advanced users who are more accustomed to long workouts indicated by the lengthy session duration, which typically isn't suitable for beginners."
