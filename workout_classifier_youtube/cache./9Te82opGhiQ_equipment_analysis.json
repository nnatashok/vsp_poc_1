  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled '35 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT || Intermediate Mat Pilates (No Equipment)', indicating that no equipment beyond a mat is needed. The description mentions 'Mat from Liforme' with a promotional code, strongly implying the use of a mat. Although the title states 'No Equipment', in Pilates, a mat is typically considered essential for comfort and safety during floor exercises. The tags also include 'mat pilates,' which suggests that a mat is the primary piece of equipment used. Therefore, the high confidence score is assigned to the mat as the only necessary equipment for this workout."
