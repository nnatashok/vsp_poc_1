  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for cycling, specifically on a stationary bike, generally aligns with the 'Beginner' level given the simplicity of the motion involved. There is minimal coordination required, and it is primarily about maintaining a steady pedaling rhythm. Evidence from the video description suggests the workout can be applied to both stationary and road biking. While road biking might introduce slightly more complexity (balancing and maneuvering), the core activity itself remains quite straightforward, supporting a high beginner score. An intermediate rating is also included due to potential variations in intensity and settings on the bike.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Biking, as discussed in the video, can vary in intensity from low to high. However, the brief duration of 9 minutes implies that the workout exposes users primarily to the 'Light' to 'Moderate' zones. The description mentions targeting different intensities, but short time commitment suggests less taxing effort overall for a beginner or moderately fit person. Viewer comments about using biking regularly imply its sustainability, supporting a moderate effort classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout's context and duration indicate that it is accessible to beginners with the primary activity being low-impact cycling. The varied intensity levels mentioned in the description suggest that those with an intermediate level of fitness could also engage meaningfully. While user comments reflect the adaptability of biking for various goals, the short 9-minute duration maintains it within a beginner to intermediate engagement range. Advanced users might find it beneficial as a short adjunct to other more strenuous workouts, hence a smaller advanced score is included."
