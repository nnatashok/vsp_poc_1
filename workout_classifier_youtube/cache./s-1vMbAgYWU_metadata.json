    "I want to thank everyone for your kind words of support with Cleo&#39;s passing. It&#39;s been a hard week but I&#39;m doing better. I filmed this class a few weeks before she died and have found it hard to get in front of the camera again, but I&#39;m going to try and create a fall equinox flow for you for next week. Enjoy this flexibility flow and thank you all again so much. xx",
