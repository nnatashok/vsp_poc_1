    "Hi everyone! Thanks so much for practicing with me and I appreciate all of the feedback. \ud83d\udc95<br><br>It takes quite a bit of time to plan, film and edit each class so knowing how I can improve is helpful! My newer classes have improved audio/video sync so be sure to check those out, if this one didn\u2019t suit you. Have a great day! <br><br>P.S. this video was filmed in one of my favorite places - Lombok, Indonesia \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f",
    "Jess you\u2019ve become my favorite YouTube yoga instructor! You don\u2019t talk to much, you\u2019re very informative and a great help. Keep up the good work!",
    "YouTube is flooded with yoga classes and I find most instructors talk way too much.  It makes it difficult to immerse yourself in a practice and make it your own with constant talking.  Jessica&#39;s minimal cues provide just enough to follow and gives the practice room to breathe. It&#39;s perfect.",
    "I like how slow and peaceful this was, no rushing, just soft and calm.",
    "I am a certified yoga teacher - and I can tell that this video is amazing! Very professional! Wonderful voice!!!!"
