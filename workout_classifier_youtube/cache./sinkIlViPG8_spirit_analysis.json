  "spiritsExplanation": "'Structured & Disciplined' is highly applicable because the workout title and description emphasize a planned approach with multiple rounds and specific repetitions per round, reflecting a methodical process to fatigue muscle groups. The focus on form and progression with heavy weights supports this (\"slow, controlled movements,\" \"3 rounds of each exercise\"). This warrants a score of 0.85 for being a core aspect of the workout.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' receives a score of 0.6 due to the emphasis on strength and fatigue (\"really fatigue each muscle group and feel the burn\") and the session's 40 seconds of work followed by 20 seconds of rest. The descriptors like \"strong and safe\" and comments appreciating the intensity further support this spirit. However, the lack of speed-indicating language lowers its score, as the pace is not the primary focus, making it more secondary.\n\n'Soothing & Restorative' is not chosen, as the session aims for high effort and strength gains rather than relaxation or recovery. Likewise, 'Flow & Rhythm' is omitted since there is no focus on musicality or seamless movements. The indoor setting and strength focus exclude 'Outdoor & Adventure,' while the lack of sport-specific elements eliminates 'Sport & Agility.'"
