  "title": "10-Minute Guided Stretching Routine for Runners",
  "description": "This guided stretching routine is great for runners or anyone with tight hips! We'll hold each static stretch for about 30 seconds, spending a total of 10 minutes targeting some of the common tight areas for those who run (or spin) frequently.\n\nI recommend doing this stretching routine AFTER a run. Before a run, focus on mobility and dynamic stretches/movements. I have some guided running warm ups on my channel:\n\u2014Run warm up: https://youtu.be/P3akL1qoSQQ\n\u2014Warm up with a band: https://youtu.be/znOktRB9j8w\n\n\nFor details, visit my blog: http://bit.ly/1OWLiq1\n\n_____\n\n\u2014Follow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/nicolepearce/\n\u2014Follow me on TikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@nicolepearcemovement\n\n_____\n\nSONG | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89IUA...\n\nDisclosure: This post was made in partnership with Watermark Seaport.

    "I&#39;ve been doing this routine for years now and it is my all time favourite stretching routine! Thank you so much!",
    "I\u2019ve been running a lot preparing for a half marathon, and i used to only stretch my hamstrings bending down, calves on a step, and quads holding my foot. This thing stretched my booty like it was a rubber band, all the sides of the legs and the something band she said, i mean i was starting to feel awful but i love this i love it thank you",
    "I like how you didn\u2019t put music because I was able to put my own. Awesome video, super relaxing (:"
