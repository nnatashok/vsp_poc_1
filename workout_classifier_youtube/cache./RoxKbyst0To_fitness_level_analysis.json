  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video title and description clearly indicate that the exercises are geared towards beginners, suggesting simple movements to start with calisthenics. The use of terms like \"basics\" and \"beginner workout plan\" implies beginner-friendly exercises. The inclusion of exercises like pike push-ups, pull-ups, and hollow holds indicates basic calisthenics requiring some coordination, aligning with intermediate-level technique difficulty due to the need for proper form execution.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video's short duration (6:22) suggests it is not very physically demanding, aligning with a light effort level. However, exercises such as pull-ups can increase effort, indicating a moderate level for deconditioned users. The comments about modifying difficulty and the introductory nature of the routine support these classifications.",
