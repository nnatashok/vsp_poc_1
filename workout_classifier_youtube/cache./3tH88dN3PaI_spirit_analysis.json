  "spiritsExplanation": "The video primarily embodies a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit as it is described as an 'intense 5 minute at home core workout' and repeatedly mentions activities like 'fat burn' and 'sculpt and lose belly fat,' indicating a focus on rapid, vigorous exercises. This is further supported by user comments expressing the workout's difficulty and the burning sensation experienced, a clear sign of intensity. I assigned a score of 0.75, reflecting strong indicators of high energy.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit also appears due to the mention of this workout being part of a larger program and structured guide available on the LEAN app. The consistent reference to a planned, methodical approach in pursuing fitness goals, as evident in the video description and user comments on daily progress, justifies a 0.6 score.\n\nLastly, 'Flow & Rhythm' is somewhat present since the workout is a Pilates routine, which typically involves coordinated movements and can imply a rhythmic flow. The moderate occurrence of these elements justifies a score of 0.45. Tools like music, which often drive rhythm, were not explicitly mentioned, leaving some ambiguity regarding this classification."
