  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 23-minute duration and focus on core and abs might require a moderate effort, especially if continuous activation is required without much rest, typical of Pilates workouts. The description mentions it's slower-paced, suggesting it's not overly intense, hence Light to Moderate effort. Some comments reflect on maintaining form, implying consistent moderate effort, with Challenging aspects for less fit users.",
