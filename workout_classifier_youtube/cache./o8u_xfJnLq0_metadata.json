    "I didn&#39;t even realised this is 20 minutes it went so fast and I&#39;m a beginner and I can do all of this exercises and it actually feels like it burns its one of the best workouts I&#39;ve ever tired.",
    "Instead of doing one of those day by days where people forget, I&#39;ll just skip to the results. Guys I&#39;ve been working out using YT videos since 2020 and been doing pilates for 4 of those years and trust me this video GIVES RESULTS. I&#39;m trying to lean down my body fat % and see more visible abs and it&#39;s giving me TONED BACK TONED LEGS TONED ABS SMALL WAIST, BEAUTIFUL NON BULKY OBLIQUES AND A FLAT STOMACH GUYS THIS IS AN ALL IN ONE AND ITS NOT TERRIBLE BC ITS BEGINNERS.<br><br>As a decently experienced YT pilates lover, this was a joy to do and I got results even after 2-3 days. I will continue doing this it contains hidden stretches in the workouts for both strengthening and leaning at the same time it&#39;s beautiful and I always feel amazing afterwards.<br><br>Thank you lidia mera for always being the best at making calming fun pulates videos with nice music!!",
