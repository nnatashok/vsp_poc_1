  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'The Meditative Grind' with a score of 0.7 due to its repetitive, follow-along nature, and structured rounds, which promotes a zone-in mentality. The routine's calming approach, as noted by comments such as \"no yelling, just good music,\" supports this vibe. It lacks the high-intensity and adrenaline-pumping qualities of more dynamic workouts, aligning instead with a more meditative focus.\n\nAdditionally, the workout fits 'The Foundation Builder' vibe with a score of 0.65. The focus on calisthenics and fundamental exercises like inchworms, lunges, and planks caters to strengthening basics and correcting form. Beginners and intermediates are targeted, further emphasizing foundational development over advanced prowess.\n\n'Warrior Workout' and other intense vibes were excluded due to the workout's beginner-friendly and composed nature, which prioritizes form and accessibility rather than maximal intensity. The instructor's gentle encouragement and structured progressions enhance the foundational and meditative qualities of the session."
