  "vibesExplanation": "The main vibe of this workout leans towards 'The Progression Quest' with a score of 0.7. The workout focuses on strength building over a set duration with a structured approach, indicating a methodical and goal-oriented plan, which is a hallmark of the Progression Quest. The encouragement to 'lift heavy' for sustained periods also supports this vibe as it emphasizes long-term strength gains. Secondly, 'The Warrior Workout' was selected with a score of 0.6 due to the emphasis on pushing beyond comfort zones and working with heavy weights, embodying sweat-dripping, primal energy. The repetitive, focused nature of these exercises aligns partially with 'The Masterclass Workout' at 0.5, hinting at skill-building in technique with the detailed exercise list. Other vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Nightclub Workout' were excluded due to lack of focus on breath-centered or music-driven experiences."
