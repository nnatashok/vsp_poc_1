  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '30 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT - Apartment & Small Space Friendly (No Equipment, No Jumping)' explicitly states that it requires no equipment. The description reinforces that the workout is designed to be performed without any equipment, making it suitable for apartment dwellers and those with space limitations. The tags like 'no equipment workout' and 'full body workout no jumping' further emphasize this aspect. The mention of a mat in the description is related to a recommendation and not a requirement for the workout itself. Therefore, this workout appears to be entirely bodyweight-based."
