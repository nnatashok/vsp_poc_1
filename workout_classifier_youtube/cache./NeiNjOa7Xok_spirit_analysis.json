  "spiritsExplanation": "The video, titled '20 Minute Full Body Stretch Routine,' clearly embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, evidenced by its emphasis on gentle stretching and muscle relaxation without any equipment. The title and repetitive use of 'stretch' in both the description and tags, such as 'full body stretch,' 'post workout stretch,' and 'morning stretch,' align with recovery and stress reduction. The commentary from viewers about alleviating conditions like arthritis, peripheral neuropathy, and the overall feeling of 'better' post-routine further ratify its restorative nature, assigning this a score of 1.0 for 'Soothing & Restorative.'\n\nAdditionally, the sequence of movements described, such as 'Standing Side Stretch,' 'Child's Pose,' and 'Full Body Twist,' suggest an element of 'Flow & Rhythm,' although not music-driven, indicating a smooth and continuous session, supporting a score of 0.6. The channel's branding around wellness and lifestyle, combined with the user's ability to use personal music preference, subtly supports this flow aspect. However, there's no high intensity, sports-specific elements, or outdoor components, which exclude other spirits from selection."
