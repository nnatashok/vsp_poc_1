  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves the use of dumbbells and incorporates movements likely requiring coordination and balance, indicative of an Intermediate level. The description mentions full body strength training, involving various body parts and potentially compound movements, which suggests a need for some coordination and proper form execution. The comments mentioning challenges, such as difficulty with jumps, indicate some Advanced techniques are involved, but the overall technique isn't described as intricate, hence weighted more toward Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'killer' and 'intense,' suggesting a high energy expenditure. The lack of rest during several segments indicates increased effort difficulty, consistent with a Challenging effort level, especially for those at a lower fitness level. Despite being challenging, the 34-minute duration and user comments describing it as a \"killer challenge\" also confirm that the workout is on the more demanding side, though accessible. Therefore, Moderate and Challenging levels both apply.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the Intermediate technique and Challenging effort difficulty, the workout is most suitable for Intermediate and Advanced fitness levels. The inclusion of dumbbell use allows for self-regulation of difficulty, making it adaptable to a range of fitness levels. Comments about finding the workout a \"real killer challenge\" and the description targeting 'Intermediate' suggest it's designed for those with some foundational fitness experience. Advanced is also appropriate given the intensity and complexity described."
