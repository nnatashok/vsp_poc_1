  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title explicitly mentions 'At-Home Mat Pilates,' indicating that a mat is essential for this workout. The description further supports this by recommending a specific mat brand (Liforme) and offering a discount code for purchasing it, which suggests that the mat is central to performing the exercises effectively. The repeated references to mat pilates in the tags, such as 'mat pilates,' reinforce this necessity. Given this evidence, the confidence score for the mat is set at 1.0, indicating very high confidence that it is required."
