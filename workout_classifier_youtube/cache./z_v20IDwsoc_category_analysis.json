  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary workout category identified from the metadata is 'Stretching' due to the explicit mention of 'stretching routine', 'full body flexibility', and 'follow along stretch' in the title, description, and tags. The emphasis on flexibility, mobility, and dynamically involved stretching exercises justifies a high score of 0.9. \n\n' Categories related to flexibility, like improving squat depth, further support the classification under 'Stretching'. The inclusion of terms like 'back pain relief exercises' and 'full body stretch' in the tags indicates a comprehensive stretching focus.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Mat' category is applicable with a moderate score of 0.5, as the routine is likely performed on a mat, focusing on floor-based exercises without equipment, as suggested by the description of a 'follow along' routine hitting all major muscle groups. \n\nThere is high confidence in these classifications based on the coherent and repetitive stretching-related keywords and user comments affirming the effectiveness in flexibility improvement."
