    "I&#39;m glad Claudia is there to show modifications. I love Claudia \u2764\u2764",
    "Loved this. Knowing that there were no repeats really made me focus on form and try for heavier weight. More like this please!",
    "This was exactly what I needed to get back on track after 9 days of no strength workouts. Challenging, but I did it! Thanks to you both! \u2764\u2764\u2764",
    "Thank you for the workout. I always come back to practice with you because you are one of those few trainers who provide very efficient combined moves, where we train several parts of the body at the same time."
