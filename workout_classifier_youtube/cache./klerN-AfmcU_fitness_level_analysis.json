  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves using an elliptical trainer, which primarily requires basic body movements such as leg and arm cycling, making it accessible to beginners. The description and tags indicate it's suitable for beginners (e.g., 'elliptical workout for beginners'). These machines typically have straightforward mechanics needing little coordination beyond the initial familiarization, fitting the 'Beginner' level. However, the inclusion of varying resistance levels and an interval structure may present minor challenges for complete novices, justifying a slight score for 'Intermediate.'",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'calorie-burning' and 'full body interval workout' that involves alternating between lower, upper, and full body exercises on high resistance, suggesting moderate to significant energy expenditure. The structured intervals with varying resistance increase the workout intensity, making it more challenging for beginners. The workout's 18-minute duration is less likely to push it into the 'Extreme' category, but the high resistance intervals require significant effort, placing it firmly in the 'Moderate' category, with considerations for 'Challenging' based on user comments indicating it's tough.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the technique and effort difficulty analyses, the workout is accessible to beginners due to the low technique demands. However, the interval intensity and resistance challenges increase its alignment with 'Intermediate' due to potential difficulty in maintaining effort. Comments suggest some perceive it as challenging, aligning with higher fitness levels. Given the interval nature, individuals can self-modify pace and resistance. Thus, multiple fitness levels are included, with emphasis on 'Beginner' and 'Intermediate,' while acknowledging 'Advanced' for those seeking additional intensity."
