  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is \"Structured & Disciplined,\" as evidenced by the emphasis on methodical execution, such as focusing on the full range of motion and eccentric movements described in the video. The 40 seconds on, 20 seconds rest format supports a methodical approach, aligning with clear, disciplined execution.\n\n\"High-Energy & Intense\" is another fitting spirit due to the high-frequency, time-pressured nature of the workout, as emphasized by phrases like \"Give your best - 40 sec full energy.\" User comments describing the workout as challenging and demanding further emphasize its intensity.\n\n\"Sport & Agility\" is moderately applicable, given the calisthenics focus on skills such as the human flag and planche, which are related to body control and agility, though this element is less pronounced than the other spirits.\n\nOther spirits like \"Flow & Rhythm\" and \"Soothing & Restorative\" are less relevant due to the lack of emphasis on smooth, continuous movements or relaxation."
