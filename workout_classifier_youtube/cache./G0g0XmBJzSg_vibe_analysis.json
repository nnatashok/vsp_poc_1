  "vibesExplanation": "The video, titled \"15 Minute Full Body Calisthenics Workout for Beginners,\" is explicitly positioned as beginner-friendly and foundational. This aligns strongly with \"The Foundation Builder\" vibe, as the workout focuses on strengthening weak points and perfecting basics with calisthenics techniques, which is echoed in the tags and description (e.g., \"calisthenics for beginners,\" \"starter workout\"). The score of 0.8 reflects the perfect fit with this vibe.\n\n\"The Progression Quest\" is another suitable vibe given the description's emphasis on building muscle, strength improvement, and long-term training through calisthenics. This is reinforced by user comments noting personal progress and continued use of the workout methods provided by the channel. The reference to a follow-along format, encouraging progression both through the video and linked app, justifies a score of 0.7.\n\nWhile \"The Reboot Workout\" isn't a perfect match, the workout's gentle orientation and accessibility for beginners indicate a mild element of refreshment and renewal, particularly for those just starting out and needing \"easier variations for each exercise.\" This vibe is less prominent, given only a score of 0.4."
