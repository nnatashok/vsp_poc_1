  "spiritsExplanation": "The predominant spirit of this workout video is 'Soothing & Restorative', evidenced by the video's focus on stretching for relaxation, recovery, and flexibility. The title and description emphasize reducing tight muscles and soreness, highlighting a restorative intent. The description mentions that the stretches help with 'speed up your recovery process,' 'elongate muscles', 'form of self-care', and 'recollect your thoughts', all indicative of a soothing focus. Additionally, user comments like 'nothing better than a good stretch' and 'hooked on stretching' further reinforce the soothing and restorative nature of the workout.\n\nThere is also a moderate element of 'Flow & Rhythm', as the description talks about focusing on breathing, enjoying the music, and taking time with the stretches, suggesting a mind-body connection and a smooth, rhythmic pace. However, this spirit is less predominant than the restorative aspect, leading to a lower score.\n\nOther potential spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the video's clear emphasis on relaxation and recovery rather than intensity or athletic training."
