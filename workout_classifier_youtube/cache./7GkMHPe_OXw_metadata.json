    "One of your best workouts.  When I started working out, I couldn&#39;t even do all the exercises.  4 months later, I use it for a warmup before running.  My 50+ year body is transforming.  Muscles are toned.  I think I am now lighter than when I finished college in 1994.  Thank you so much!",
    "Man Ive hit a rough patch in my life, I&#39;ve been looking for a way out of my mental prison of negative thoughts, unfortunate personal circumstances and was just looking for hope without complicating things AND I FOUND YOUR VIDEO! Day 1 only but I KNOW I WILL CONTINUE!!!!!!! Thanks million for the encouragement! Kindly",
    "Hey. Been doing this for around 7 weeks now and wow, its really transitioned me from being a mid 20s sloth who could not dream of working out, to doing this 3 times a week and found a new passion. I keep trying to improve each day and feel amazing. Genuinely thank you and to anyone who is starting, DON&#39;T GIVE UP. Do this at least 2 times a week if you can and remember to let your body recover and things will work out. You got this and make sure to do at your own pace. Honestly thank you so much!",
