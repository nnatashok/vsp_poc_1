  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Meditation' with a score of 0.9, reflecting very high confidence. The title, description, and tags all explicitly refer to meditation, specifically focused on 'chakra balance and cleansing', which aligns with meditative practices. Terms like 'guided meditation', 'chakra balance', and 'chakra cleansing' directly indicate meditation. The channel 'Great Meditation' and its focus on guided meditations support this classification. \n\nThe 'Breathing exercises' category is also mildly considered, with a score of 0.2, due to the mention of guiding through chakra points which often involves breath work. However, explicit details about breathing exercises are scarce, limiting the score and confidence for this category. Overall, the metadata strongly supports 'Meditation' as the primary focus, with 'Breathing exercises' as a minor element."
