  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit identified is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is driven by the video's focus on deep breathing exercises designed to cleanse the lymphatic system, reduce anxiety, and promote relaxation and healing, as indicated in both the title and description. Phrases like 'eliminate stress,' 'unlock your full potential,' and 'relaxation' further support this focus. The comments reflecting personal health improvement and relaxation benefits reinforce this classification.\n\nThe video also embodies elements of the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, with a score of 0.7. This is due to the methodical nature of the breathing technique described (4s inhale, 16s hold, 8s exhale) and the focus on precision and guidance throughout the exercise. Comments mentioning guidance and counting to remain mindful highlight this structure.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'High-Energy & Intense' are not applicable as the video doesn't emphasize music-driven flow or intense physical exertion. Similarly, there is no focus on athleticism or outdoor elements to consider 'Sport & Agility' or 'Outdoor & Adventure.'"
