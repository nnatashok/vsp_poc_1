  "spiritsExplanation": "The video 'Pilates for Beginners - 15 Minute Beginner Pilates Workout' embodies a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit as it focuses on Pilates, an exercise system that emphasizes coordination and smooth transition between movements. The repeated theme of 'beginner Pilates' and 'gentle Pilates' in the tags suggests a workout that is rhythmically suitable for those new to exercise, encouraging a mind-body connection (score 0.7).\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is evident given the video's gentle approach and affirming comments from users who found it beneficial for stiffness and soreness (e.g., 'My 74 year old body loved this class!'). This aligns with restorative practices that prioritize recovery and gentle movement (score 0.65).\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit also applies, albeit to a lesser extent, since Pilates itself involves precise movements and an emphasis on technical form \u2014 it's a system with inherent structure, as mentioned in the description emphasizing 'basic Pilates exercises' (score 0.5). Overall, the evidence points to a workout that is both flowing and restorative, with an underlying discipline through form-focused practice."
