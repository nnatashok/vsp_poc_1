    "More zone 2 cardio workouts please! Thanks",
    "Thank you coach for this!<br>I was struggling with Major anxiety when I started this. There have been a lot of other changes I have brought into my life but every time I do this workout, I feel the boost of positivity! <br>Grateful for this &amp; the way you keep making conversations throughout the video. No matter how many times I watch &amp; practice it, it makes me feel good each time \u2764",
    "NO CUZ WE NEED MORE OF THIS DESPERATELY. Tell me why I look this up on YouTube and hardly anybody is doing it. This is the most important type of fitness especially people who are new to fitness need to have",
    "I loved your message about not having to do all or nothing and being able to do a cardio workout that I could feel great doing the whole time rather than feeling like I was going to keel over. Thanks for the great workout and for your positivity.",
    "First timer!  Easy to follow and make me feel confident that I can do it to the end.  My doctor asked me to do zone 2 exercise 200min a week.  I\u2019d like to see more zone 2 exercise if possible\ud83d\ude0a"
