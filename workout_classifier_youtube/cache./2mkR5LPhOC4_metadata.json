  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "For the first time a 30 min workout didn&#39;t felt like 30 MINUTES workout!!! Enjoyed every part of this workout, THANK YOU SO MUCHHH\u2764",
    "That laying on the side and lifting legs was a killer. Im just starting and was surprised to see what a work out this really was! Thank you for the video, it was really great and so was the narration.",
    "I\u2019m struggling with PCOS and regular workouts always worsened my symptoms. The cortisol spike always felt like a panic attack and gave me imbalanced blood sugar and it was hard to lose weight. I\u2019ve been following your \u201cgentle\u201d pilates videos for about 2 weeks and I never felt this relaxed and at peace after a workout. The feeling of being connected to my core and my body gives me a high. Thank you!\ud83d\udc97",
    "I have avoided pilates for many years, but Nicole make it easy and fun. She is so encouraging and clear in her instructions. I look forward to these as part of my day.",
    "I\u2019m 13 and I can\u2019t express how much I love your channel, Nicole. I always viewed exercise with a bad sight, but you turned around my POV to a healthy one. Love you and endless thank-yous.\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97"
