  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is titled as a '10 Minute Yoga Full Body Stretch for Stiff Bodies,' targeting individuals who are less flexible and likely beginners to yoga. The movements are described as 'gentle' and oriented towards releasing tension and stiffness. The focus is on basic stretching rather than complex poses, indicating a Beginner level of technique difficulty.

The choice of scores reflects the video\u2019s broad accessibility for those seeking gentle movement."
