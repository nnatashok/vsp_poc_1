    "Good Morning,<br><br>This message is loooong overdue. I was diagnosed with Diabetes a year ago. I found (1) of your workouts &amp; gave it a try. Decided to subscribe and kept working out. (20) pounds lighter &amp; I&#39;m definitely in a better place.<br><br>Thanks for the motivation!",
    "I\u2019m down on my mat, drenched in sweat, trying to get up for the day. Amazing workout! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe",
    "This is the first time I&#39;ve come across your videos --- loved the workout, and I appreciate your format so much! The timers, the beeps, the progress bar, having a modification, how-tos while you&#39;re resting, and what muscle groups you&#39;re working on - everything is so helpful! You definitely have a new sub :)",
    "Found your channel last year and followed a couple workouts for a few months and then life got in the way and I stopped working out completely. This morning I couldn&#39;t sleep and woke up super early. I was going to lie on the couch and play video games, and felt so unmotivated. Then you popped in my head and was delighted to see so many new workouts. Just finished this one and it was the boost I needed to feel motivated, energized and overall good inside. Thank you so much!",
    "This is becoming my go-to workout when I&#39;m too tired or busy to come up with my own. I always end up being so happy that I did it. Thanks y&#39;all!"
