    "I\u2019ve struggled with depression for 15 years, I\u2019m a father of two little girls and I spent many days unable to give them the best of me. I found your videos about a year ago and they have opened my eyes and mind to be able to begin to rebuild myself. I have been able to repair my marriage with my wife who stuck with me through all my downs. I am able to be the dad I always wanted to be. I wanted to truly thank you for your messages and the work you put into them. They have forever changed my life and helped me become the better version of myself to give to others. Thank you",

    "My life was spiralling 15 months ago. My husband was dying. My house needed to be sold, I had two children to look after. I decided I had to live and started to look for ways to survive. I found you guys. I\u2019ve meditated every day for 13 months. You, Juliana and Mark have given me strength. <br>I now am in such a different place. My husband was transplanted and continues to recover, we have a new home to live and breathe in and I have the most loved job. My children and I are happy. We are living a new life with meditation involved in all of our lives. I\u2019ll always be grateful to you both. You have resonated with me on such a level that others haven\u2019t. I\u2019m sending you my love and thanks. Eternally grateful. Keep on being you guys.\u2728\u2728\u2728",
    "I cried listening to you. I&#39;ve been feeling heavy lately with everything happening around the world. This helped, thank you! &lt;3"
