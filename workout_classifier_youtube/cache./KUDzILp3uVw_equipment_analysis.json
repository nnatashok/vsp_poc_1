  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title explicitly states \"No Equipment,\" suggesting that this dance workout does not require any equipment to perform. The description reinforces that this is a dance cardio routine, which typically relies on body movement rather than external equipment. The lack of mentions of specific equipment in the tags, description, or comments supports the conclusion that no equipment is needed. The channel focuses on at-home workouts, often implying minimal to no equipment requirements. Therefore, this workout appears to be a bodyweight-only dance routine without the need for equipment."
