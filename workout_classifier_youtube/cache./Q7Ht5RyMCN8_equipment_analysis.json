  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata suggests that this is predominantly an indoor cycling workout. The title 'Pyramid Style HIIT Cardio Workout' and tags such as 'spinning', 'spin class', 'indoor cycling', 'cycling workout', and 'exercise bike' indicate that an exercise bike is central to this workout. The description further reinforces this, mentioning the pyramid structure based on RPM/speed and challenges such as increasing resistance on the bike, underlining the necessity of an exercise bike. The channel name, Kaleigh Cohen Cycling, and previous workouts also focus on cycling, adding to confidence. Therefore, an Exercise bike is assigned a very high confidence score of 0.9 as it is clearly the main equipment required for performing the workout effectively."
