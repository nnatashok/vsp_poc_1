  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is classified primarily under the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, with a high confidence score of 0.8. This is evident from the emphasis on rhythmic breathing exercises and music, which are central to creating a smooth, continuous flow of breathwork. The tags 'breathwork music' and mentions of 'rhythmic music' in the channel's mission underscore this element. The description and comments further highlight the integration of breathwork into daily routines, promoting a seamless, rhythmical practice.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also present, with a confidence score of 0.7. The workout aims to boost the immune system, lower stress, and enhance relaxation, as highlighted in the description. This restorative aspect is underscored by comments from users experiencing reduced anxiety and enhanced meditation practices following the breathwork, which aligns with the soothing and healing qualities of this spirit. The exclusion of high-energy or sport-related spirits is due to the absence of indications of intense physical exertion or competitiveness."
