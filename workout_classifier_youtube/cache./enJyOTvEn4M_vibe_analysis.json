  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled '5 Minute Breathing Exercise (Guided Meditation)' strongly aligns with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe, as it focuses on a calming breathing exercise, aiming to ease anxiety and promote relaxation. This is evident from phrases like 'tune in to your breathing' and 'natural and easy' in the description, supporting a vibe of nervous system reset and gentle movement. The tags 'guided meditation' and 'anxiety meditation' further confirm this.\n\nAdditionally, there are elements of 'The Zen Flow', given the descriptive emphasis on being 'present with and connected to their own breath'. This suggests a grounding and intentional exercise, consistent with the unhurried, breath-centered nature of Zen Flow. Comments from users highlighting the calming effect and the importance of inner peace also reinforce these vibes.\n\nAlternative vibes like 'The Comfort Moves' were considered but scored lower due to the lack of emphasis on physical movement or cozy environment common in those workouts. The score confidence is high (0.85) due to clear indicators across multiple metadata elements."
