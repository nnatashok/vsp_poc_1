  "categoriesExplanation": "The video titled \"21-MIN FLUID WORKOUT FOR WEIGHT LOSS - NO JUMPING, NO REPEATS\" is categorized primarily under 'Mat' and 'Body weight' based on various indicators. The emphasis on \"no jumping, no repeats\" suggests a workout routine that is steady and can be performed on an exercise mat using body movements alone, aligning well with the 'Mat' category. This is further supported by the types of exercises listed in the description, such as body rotations, lunges, and squats, which are typically performed on the ground without equipment. The description and tags emphasize \"beginner,\" \"home workout,\" and \"no equipment,\" suggesting that the exercises rely exclusively on body weight, which justifies a secondary classification as 'Body weight.' The tag \"full body exercise\" and emphasis on \"fat burn\" also support these categorizations. The confidence in these categories is high, as there are explicit references to exercise types and workout style in the metadata."
