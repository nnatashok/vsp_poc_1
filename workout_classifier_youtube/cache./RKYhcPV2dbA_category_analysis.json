  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Stretching' with a very high confidence level (0.95). The title explicitly mentions 'stretches', and the description emphasizes a 'FULL BODY stretch' designed for flexibility and mobility, reinforced by the tags such as 'full body stretching routine', 'stretch for flexibility', and 'essential stretches'. Commenters frequently mention improved flexibility and mobility over a 30-day period, supporting this classification.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Mat' with a moderate score (0.6). The workouts are performed on a mat, as indicated by the description linking an exercise mat and no equipment needed. While the mat is used, the emphasis and core of the video are stretching routines, justifying the lower score for 'Mat'. Other categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Pilates' were excluded as there is no mention of mindfulness or core strength, which are characteristic of those categories. The focus is purely on general stretches for flexibility and mobility."
