  "spiritsExplanation": "The video titled '5 Minute Morning Yoga - Daily Stretching Routine' strongly indicates a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a score of 0.9. This is evident from phrases in the description like 'quick and simple yoga sequence to energize and stretch your body' and 'No props needed and suitable for all levels,' highlighting its gentle and accessible nature, suitable for relaxation and stress relief. The quick 5-minute duration and emphasis on morning stretches further support this classification, as brief, low-intensity sessions cater well to soothing intentions.\n\nAdditionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is rated at 0.7 as the video includes a 'yoga flow' and mentions of 'vinyasa flow,' indicating a smooth, rhythmic movement sequence typical of yoga that connects breath and movement. The use of the term 'sequence' and the progression through various poses further imply a flowing nature rather than intense or structured.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Structured & Disciplined,' and 'Sport & Agility' were not considered due to the lack of intense or structured workout cues, while 'Outdoor & Adventure' is irrelevant given the indoor focus of the session."
