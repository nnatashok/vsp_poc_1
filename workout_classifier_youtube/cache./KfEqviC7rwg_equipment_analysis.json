  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Surrender Meditation | A Spoken guided visualization (Letting go of control)' by Jason Stephenson is a guided meditation visualization intended for sleep, relaxation, and stress release. The metadata indicates that this video is targeted towards enhancing mental peace through auditory guidance rather than physical exercise. The tags and description focus on meditation and relaxation without any mention of physical equipment typically associated with structured workouts. The emphasis is on listening to a verbal guide for deep relaxation and stress relief.\n\nAdditionally, there is no mention of physical activity or any equipment in the comments, and the channel predominantly shares meditation and relaxation content. Therefore, there is a very high confidence that no physical workout equipment is required to participate in this guided meditation session; it is bodyweight (or no-equipment) only."
