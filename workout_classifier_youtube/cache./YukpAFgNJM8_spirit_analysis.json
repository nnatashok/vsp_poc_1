  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's focus on PCOS and hormonal imbalances suggests a calming and healing approach, aligning with the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The description highlights a 'low impact' workout, which typically involves gentle movements suitable for restoration. Additionally, user comments reinforce this perception as participants felt less stressed and were able to follow the routine without exhaustion, which suggests a score of 0.8 for Soothing & Restorative. \n\nFlow & Rhythm is also relevant due to the inclusion of yoga, a practice known for connecting breath with movement, as indicated by multiple components in the video (e.g., yoga, Pilates). The workout is structured with cardio and strength components, implying a degree of routine and predictability, which is why Structure & Discipline scores 0.5. \n\nWhile the description mentions 'cardio + strength training,' the low impact nature and user feedback do not emphasize high intensity, excluding High-Energy & Intense. Similarly, heavily sports-oriented spirits like Sport & Agility and Outdoor & Adventure are less applicable here."
