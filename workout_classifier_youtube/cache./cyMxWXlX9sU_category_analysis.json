  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under the 'Meditation' category, with a very high confidence level (1.0), as evidenced by the title '10 Minute Guided Meditation for Positive Energy, Peace & Light \ud83c\udf24', which explicitly mentions guided meditation as its central theme. Additionally, the description emphasizes meditation practices such as visualization and positive affirmations suitable for all levels, including beginners, further supporting this classification.\n\nThe secondary category, 'Breathing exercises', has been assigned a score of 0.6. While the primary focus is on meditation, the description's mention of full body relaxation implies the inclusion of breathing techniques, as such practices often encompass controlled breathing for relaxation. However, this is only an inferred component and not explicitly stated in the metadata, leading to a lower confidence score compared to the primary category.\n\nNo evidence supports other categories such as Yoga, Stretching, or Body weight exercises, as there is no mention of physical postures, flexibility training, or strength exercises in the metadata."
