  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The primary piece of equipment needed for this workout is a treadmill. This is evident from both the video title and description, which explicitly mention a \"treadmill walking workout.\" The focus is on a 10-minute power walk using Taylor Swift music, which requires a treadmill to execute effectively. Additionally, the tags associated with the video (e.g., \"treadmill walking workout,\" \"beginner treadmill workout,\" \"treadmill workout for beginners\") further confirm that a treadmill is not only used but is central to the workout experience. Comments from viewers express appreciation for \"treadmill workouts,\" reinforcing that a treadmill is integral to the activity. Given the repeated emphasis on treadmill use throughout the metadata, there is very high confidence (0.9) that a treadmill is required for this workout."
