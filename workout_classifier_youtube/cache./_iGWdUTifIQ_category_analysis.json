  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under the 'Meditation' category due to explicit mentions in the title, tags, and description of being a 'guided meditation' intended for 'inner peace and calm.' The channel, 'The Mindful Movement,' also focuses on meditation content, supporting a strong presence of meditation practices. The high view count and engagement indicate a successful meditation session. The description emphasizes relaxation and self-compassion, common elements of meditation. Hence, a score of 0.9 is assigned.\n\nAdditionally, there is an aspect of 'Breathing exercises,' inferred from the mindful breathing component common in guided meditations (e.g., comments discussing the impact of breathing and letting go). While not explicitly stated, this is a reasonable inclusion based on context, granting it a moderate score of 0.6."
