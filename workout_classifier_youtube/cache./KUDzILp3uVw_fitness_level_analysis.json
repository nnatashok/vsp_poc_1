  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a dance cardio routine based on the music of One Direction. Dance workouts typically involve coordinated movements but can be accessible at the beginner level if the choreography is simple and repetitive. Given the emphasis on a 'party' atmosphere and the fun, engaging nature highlighted in comments and tags, the movements are likely to be straightforward. While some dance routines can involve intricate movements, this video appears to target a broad audience, including One Direction fans, who may not have specific dance experience. Therefore, cues are probably provided to simplify execution, justifying a 'Beginner' rating, with a mild inclusion of 'Intermediate' due to dance's inherent need for some coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 16 minutes, which is manageable for a low to moderate intensity session. Described as a 'full body dance cardio routine', it is likely to increase heart rate moderately. Comments suggest it is a fun way to get a sweat on, indicative of a moderate effort level, but not excessively demanding. The emphasis on enjoyment and relatability to music reduces the perceived intensity, justifying the 'Light' rating as well. Considering the visibility and popularity of such a routine, it's positioned to appeal broadly, suggesting a primary Moderate classification with an overlay of Light effort due to variable involvement in dance routines.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Combining technique and effort difficulty, the required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner', with the potential for 'Intermediate'. The technique is simple enough for newcomers due to straightforward dance moves aligned with music to appeal to wide audiences, including One Direction fans. While the effort involves moderate cardio, it remains appropriate for those new to dance fitness by modifying intensity. Comments from users benefiting from continued participation further support the Beginner rating, with an Intermediate overlay due to possible movement complexity and cardio progression for more engaged participants."
