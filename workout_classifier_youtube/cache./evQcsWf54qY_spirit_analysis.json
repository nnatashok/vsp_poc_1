  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified under 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a score of 0.75 due to its emphasis on being 'low-impact,' 'gentle,' and appropriate for when one is on their period, indicative of a focus on recovery and comfort. The metadata, including tags like 'gentle workout for PMS' and the description noting a 'relaxing warm-up' and moving 'light, move slow' support this. Comments about participants appreciating the workout for its low intensity and encouragement further reinforce this spirit. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant, scored at 0.55, due to elements of smooth, continuous movement implied by the 'no repeat' exercises and the pacing, although it's less emphasized than restoration. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the explicit mention of avoiding 'major cardio' or 'jumping' and the video\u2019s focus on minimizing intensity."
