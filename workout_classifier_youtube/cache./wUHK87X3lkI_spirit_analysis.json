  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata suggests that the workout embodies both 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Flow & Rhythm' spirits. The dominant spirit is 'Soothing & Restorative' (score: 0.8), evidenced by the video's focus on flexibility, gentle movement, and stress reduction, as indicated by tags and comments like 'stretches for the inflexible' and 'I needed this so bad today \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc Loving these stretches'. The beginner-friendly approach and emphasis on personal relaxation and recovery further reinforce this classification. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present (score: 0.6) as the workout likely involves smooth, continuous movements that enhance flexibility, with a 'follow along' tag often implying a rhythmic, guided session. The comments also highlight enjoyment and engagement with the routine, indicating a mind-body connection. Other spirits were considered but excluded due to the lack of indicators of high intensity, structured protocols, or outdoor elements."
