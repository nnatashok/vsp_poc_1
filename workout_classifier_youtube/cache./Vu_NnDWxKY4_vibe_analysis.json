  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled '30 min Yoga for Weight Loss | Fat Burning Workout | At-Home' features indicators aligned with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The focus on yoga, weight loss, and home practice indicates a grounding and intentional aspect common in yoga, justifying a score of 0.7. Comments such as 'feels fresh and new', 'motivated', and 'muscles strengthening' suggest a calming yet effort-focused experience, supporting 'The Meditative Grind' vibe with a score of 0.6 due to the repetitive and endurance nature of daily yoga practice. Lastly, 'The Reboot Workout' is moderately represented with a score of 0.5; the video seems to provide a series of fat-burning yet accessible movements that leave viewers 'feeling fresh' and experiencing a 'good workout' without high intensity, suggesting a refreshing and rejuvenating workout experience. Other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were less relevant due to the lack of high-intensity or aggressive language in the metadata."
