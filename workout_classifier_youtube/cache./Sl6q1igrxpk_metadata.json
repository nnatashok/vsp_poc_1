    "I am still loving all the HASfit exercise videos! It is because of these videos, plus a better diet that I, as of today, have shed 200 pounds! And that was my goal!",
    "It&#39;s crazy that this is one of the only true and healthy full body stretch videos on YouTube. Everything else is for lazy people who want to get things done in 3-5 minutes, they&#39;re more interested in convenience than health.",
    "This was such a great stretch thank you Claudia and Coach Kozak.",
