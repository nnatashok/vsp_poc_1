  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled \"Equal Breathing Exercise for Sleep\" strongly suggests a focus on relaxation and stress reduction, very indicative of the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit. The description explicitly mentions preparing both body and mind for sleep, with calming the nervous system as the primary objective. This aligns perfectly with practices aimed at healing and recovery rather than physical exertion or technical skill. The user comments further reinforce this classification, with mentions of falling asleep quickly and using the video to find peace in stressful environments. These elements confirm a very high confidence level (0.95) in identifying the primary spirit as Soothing & Restorative. Other spirits do not apply as there are no indicators of intensity, flow, structure, sports focus, or outdoor elements in the metadata."
