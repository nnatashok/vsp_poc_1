  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '15 MIN FULL BODY STRETCH - For Rest Day, Improve Mobility & Flexibility, Follow Along Style' explicitly states in its description that 'No Equipment' is required for the workout. This suggests that the workout is bodyweight-only, focusing on stretching and mobility exercises. The tags and comments further support this, mentioning various types of stretches such as hip rotations, lunge stretches, and pigeon poses, which are typically performed without any equipment. Additionally, the comments reflect viewers' experiences with improved flexibility through these exercises, without mentioning any equipment use. Therefore, my analysis concludes that no equipment is necessary for this workout."
