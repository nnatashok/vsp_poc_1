  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout comprises movements like Dumbbell Burpee Deadlift, Hinge Swing + Narrow Squat Thruster, and Bent Over Back Row + Straight Arm Kick Back, which require coordination, balance, and the ability to manage weights. Terms like 'lateral lunge,' 'plank walk out,' and 'squat thruster' suggest a moderate to high complexity in technique, suitable for those with some experience in exercise routines involving weights and compound movements. Additionally, the need for proper form is crucial, particularly given the combination of bodyweight and weighted exercises. Thus, scores reflect both an intermediate and advanced understanding due to the presence of moderately complex weighted movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 35 minutes long, comprising high-intensity interval training with limited rest (40 seconds work, 20 seconds rest) and a 4-minute AMRAP finisher, which demands sustained exertion and significant energy output. The inclusion of exercises such as push-ups, dumbbell burpees, and squat thrusters, with medium-to-heavy weights, significantly increases energy expenditure. User comments confirm high exertion levels and increased heart rates, indicating that the workout is challenging, pushing towards extreme for those less conditioned.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulties, the workout fits best for intermediate to advanced users. The intermediate level derives from the modifiable weight options and the opportunity to pace oneself during intervals, while the advanced level is warranted by the workout's duration and complexity. Although some might attempt it at a beginner level by adjusting weights and rest, the intensity and technical demands make this classification appropriate for those with some foundational fitness already established. The comments also suggest it pushes one's limits, further supporting these levels."
