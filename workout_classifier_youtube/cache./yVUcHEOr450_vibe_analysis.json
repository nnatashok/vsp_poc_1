  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified for this workout is \"The Warrior Workout,\" which is characterized by intense, primal energy and is often associated with HIIT workouts. The workout is structured around high-intensity intervals, with 45 seconds on and 15 seconds off, aimed at burning up to 1000 calories in a full body routine. This aligns well with the Warrior Workout's focus on sweat-dripping, heart-pounding intensity. This vibe is strongly supported by the user's comments expressing significant physical challenge and emotional release.\n\nThe inclusion of \"The Endorphin Wave\" is due to the steady build-up of energy throughout the workout and the resultant feel-good movement experience. Comments from users reporting increased stamina and personal accomplishments suggest a sustained, rewarding effort, supporting this moderate score.\n\n\"The Adrenaline Rush\" vibe is considered due to the unpredictable challenge of following high-intensity intervals in a no-repeat format, which can be mentally engaging and physically demanding\u2014the elements of unpredictability and intensity fit well, justifying a lower score. The confidence level in the classification is high due to explicit indications in the metadata and user feedback."
