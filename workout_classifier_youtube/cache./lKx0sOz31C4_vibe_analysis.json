The description highlights activities like warming up, cardio, hip openers, and pelvic floor exercises, which are specifically tailored to be safe throughout pregnancy, reflecting a vibe of safety and ease, typical of 'Comfort Moves'. This classification is supported by tags focusing on pregnancy and ease of delivery, and the channel's emphasis on a positive, supportive approach to movement.\n\nA secondary vibe 'The Reboot Workout' is moderately present, as the exercises aim to refresh and prepare the body for childbirth, incorporating gentle stretching and core work. The workout's goal is not intense physical exertion, but rather a total-body refresh suitable for pregnant women, aligning with the ideas of a refreshing, low-stress experience. The moderate emphasis on preparation for labor and maintaining health aligns with this vibe, though the stronger focus remains on comfort."
