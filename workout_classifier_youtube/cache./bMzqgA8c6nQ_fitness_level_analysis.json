  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a guided meditation focused on chakra balancing. Meditation generally involves seated or lying positions with minimal physical movement, primarily focusing on mental processes such as visualization and breath control. These are simple to follow and do not require any complex coordination or advanced physical technique, making them suitable for beginners. There are no complex movements described in the metadata, indicating a very low technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video's duration is 20 minutes, which fits within the timeframe suitable for light effort activities, particularly given the nature of the content, which is a guided meditation. Meditation involves minimal physical exertion, focusing instead on mental activity. The terms used in the description, such as 'soothing guidance' and 'rejuvenating', suggest a calming, low-energy activity designed to promote relaxation rather than physical exertion.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the low technique and effort difficulty, the main audience is clearly beginners, as meditation requires little to no physical fitness level. However, due to the focus on mental concentration and chakra balance, individuals with an intermediate level of mindfulness practice might also find the session useful. The meditation is accessible to anyone regardless of their physical fitness, but those with more experience in meditation (intermediate) could benefit from deeper or more effective engagement. Despite the small correlation, it's mostly suitable for beginners."
