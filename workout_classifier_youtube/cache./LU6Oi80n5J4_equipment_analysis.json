  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "This workout video focuses exclusively on guided breathing exercises, as indicated by the title \"Guided Breathing\" and the description. The metadata emphasizes breathing techniques without mentioning any physical exercises or equipment that would require supplementation. The tags such as \"wim hof\", \"breathwork\", \"mindfulness breathing\", and \"guided meditation\" align with a focus on breath control and meditation, traditionally performed without physical exercise equipment. Additionally, the safety information provided does not suggest the need for any equipment but instead gives guidelines on situational awareness during practice. Taking into account this information, I conclude with high confidence that no specific equipment is needed for this workout, as it appears to be bodyweight and breathing focused only."
