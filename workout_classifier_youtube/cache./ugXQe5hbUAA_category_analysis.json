  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily categorized as 'Stretching' with high confidence (score: 0.95) because the title, tags, and description emphasize stretching and increasing flexibility, particularly for beginners. Key phrases such as 'BEGINNER FLEXIBILITY ROUTINE,' 'stretches for the inflexible,' '30 min stretch,' and 'full body stretch' provide strong indicators that the video focuses on a stretching routine designed to improve flexibility. Additional tags such as 'beginner flexibility' and 'follow along stretch' further confirm this focus.\n\nA secondary category of 'Mat' is also assigned with a moderate score of 0.6, reflecting the likely use of a mat for performing the floor-based stretching exercises. This inference is supported by the description mentioning the specific mat used, suggesting that the exercises involve mat work, common in stretching routines. There is no mention of equipment or intense conditioning, which excludes categories like 'Weight workout,' 'HIIT,' or 'Pilates.'\n\nThe confidence level is high (0.9) due to explicit indicators across multiple metadata sources."
