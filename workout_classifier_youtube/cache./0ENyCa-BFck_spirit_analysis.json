  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is clearly intended for beginners in calisthenics, as seen in the title ('How To Start Calisthenics in 2025') and reinforced by the numerous tags such as 'calisthenics for beginners', 'beginner calisthenics workout', and 'bodyweight workout beginner'. The structured nature is emphasized by the detailed breakdown of the workout into specific chapters in the description (e.g., Pull-Up, Inverted Row, Push-Up, etc.) suggesting a methodical approach to training. This justifies a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a high score of 0.9.\n\nThere is moderate confidence in the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, given calisthenics often involves smooth, coordinated body movement patterns. However, the content's emphasis is on progression and structured learning, warranting a score of 0.5.\n\nA 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is present to a mild extent (score: 0.3) as the video is designed to help beginners overcome initial workout challenges (evidenced by phrases like 'for those of you who can't do a pull-up'), promoting gradual strength-building and development, which can feel restorative to those starting from a low fitness level."
