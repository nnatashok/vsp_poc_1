  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Guided Breathing: Awaken Your Inner Monk-Mode (3 Rounds w/ timer)' from the channel Kitaro Waga does not mention or imply the use of any physical fitness equipment in its metadata. The description focuses on guided breathwork, integrating the Wim Hof Method and mindfulness meditation, without reference to any exercise props or tools typically required for such practices. Consistent with the content type, user comments emphasize the effectiveness and mental clarity benefits of this breathwork and mindfulness practice without mentioning any equipment. Therefore, it appears that no physical equipment is necessary for this session, indicating it is a bodyweight or mental exercise only."
