  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title, description, and tags explicitly state that the workout is 'Standing Only' and 'No Equipment.' The consecutive mention of 'standing workout' and 'no equipment' in the title indicates a bodyweight-only format. Additionally, the description reinforces this by emphasizing exercises done in a standing position without any equipment reference. The step-by-step list of exercises includes movements such as side leg raises and squats to crunches, which are typically performed as bodyweight movements. The comments also focus on weight-loss results without any mention of equipment use. Therefore, based on the metadata and user engagement, it is clear that no equipment is required for this workout."
