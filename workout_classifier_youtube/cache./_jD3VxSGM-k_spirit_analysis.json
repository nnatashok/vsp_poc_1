  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout spirit for this video is predominantly 'Soothing & Restorative' with an extremely high confidence level. The title explicitly states the video is a 'guided meditation for pain and sickness,' which indicates a focus on healing and relaxation. Tags such as 'heal your body,' 'natural way to help with pain,' and 'relax me online' further suggest a restorative intent. The channel, 'Jason Stephenson - Sleep Meditation Music,' is devoted to meditation and relaxation content, reinforcing a soothing spirit. The description mentions 'peaceful meditations and inspired living,' further aligning with healing and stress reduction. User comments reveal emotional and physical healing experiences, such as a user mentioning their wife with cancer who relies on these meditations for comfort, suggesting strong emotional support and solace. Other spirits were not considered relevant due to the clear emphasis on rest, recovery, and emotional well-being rather than physical exertion, structure, or outdoor activity."
