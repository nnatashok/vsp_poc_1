  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes movements like goblet squats, uneven lunges, dumbbell swings, snatches, and lateral raises. These exercises require some coordination and balance, especially when performed in a HIIT setting. The presence of snatches and uneven thrusters increases the complexity slightly, making it more than just an intermediate-level workout. The inclusion of 45 different exercises indicates a variety of movement patterns requiring coordination, but they are not technically complex enough to be classified as expert-level exercises. Thus, the technique difficulty is predominantly intermediate, with some advanced elements due to the compound and changing nature of exercises.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's 45-minute duration with 30-second work intervals and only 15-second rest periods indicates a high level of physical demand, fitting the challenging category strongly. The inclusion of two 90-second finishers adds to the intensity, offering minimal rest relative to work time. User comments and the description emphasize the mental and physical demand of the routine, supporting a higher effort difficulty rating. Thus, this workout can be categorized as challenging but also moderately extreme due to sustained effort and high energy expenditure required over the extended period of the session.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique and effort difficulties align to suggest that this workout is best suited for intermediate to advanced fitness levels. The technique involves a variety of exercises that require a moderate level of coordination and strength, while the effort required\u2014consistent 45-minute duration with intensive intervals\u2014necessitates good cardiovascular and muscular endurance, consistent with advanced fitness levels. The metadata, including comments mentioning the pushing of physical limits, supports the need for participants to have some existing fitness foundation, although the ability for progression suggests intermediate users can still attempt with modifications. Given the weight-based nature, users can self-adjust weights, allowing some variability in fitness levels to be accommodated, hence both intermediate and advanced are suitable classifications."
