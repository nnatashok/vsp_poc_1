  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is a 'Third Trimester Prenatal Cardio Workout,' where the title explicitly mentions 'Prenatal' and 'Cardio,' suggesting a workout suitable for pregnant individuals. The description states that the only equipment needed is a 'mat or soft surface,' indicating floor exercises with minimal impact, which aligns with the 'Mat' workout category. Additionally, the nature of a third-trimester workout implies a lower intensity suitable for safety, further hinting at mat-based exercises. There is a question in the comments about intensity, but it remains focused on prenatal mat activities. This interpretation leads to a high-confidence classification under 'Mat' with a score of 0.8, due to the prenatal focus which typically involves gentle, mat-based exercises to accommodate the physical limitations during pregnancy."
