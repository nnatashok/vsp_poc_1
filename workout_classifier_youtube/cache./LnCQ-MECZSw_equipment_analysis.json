  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The description of the video explicitly mentions that viewers 'may want a chair or surface to hold onto' during the workout. This implies that a chair is used for stability or support during some of the stretching exercises. However, the chair is described in a way that suggests it may not be required for every exercise, but could be beneficial especially for those needing extra support. This results in a high confidence (0.6) that a chair is part of the workout equipment."
