  "vibesExplanation": "The metadata strongly supports 'The Deep Recharge' as the primary vibe due to the focus on mindfulness meditation, self-love, and easing pressure, which aligns with an ultra-gentle, nervous system calming approach. The video's title emphasizes 'going easy on yourself' and 'self-care,' indicating a practice intended for deep relaxation and mental reset. The description and content tags such as 'meditation,' 'calm,' and 'zen,' along with channel and comment references to reducing anxiety and promoting inner peace, further bolster this assessment. Hence, a score of 0.9 indicates a very strong match.\n\nThe additional selection of 'The Zen Flow' is justified by the emphasis on intentional mindfulness and a grounding approach, qualities typically associated with this vibe. The terms 'guided mindfulness' and 'calm' from the title and description suggest a breath-centered, unhurried process typical of a Zen Flow. A score of 0.8 reflects a strong fit, albeit slightly less than 'The Deep Recharge.' This dual vibe allocation takes into account the meditation's dual purpose of providing deep rest as well as promoting a focused, grounding experience."
