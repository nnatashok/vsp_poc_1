  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is designed as a gentle yoga flow, specifically described for beginners. Yoga poses typically require some coordination, flexibility, and balance, which aligns with a 'Beginner' technique difficulty. The use of the term 'gentle', and the lack of mention of advanced techniques or poses, supports this classification. While yoga inherently requires an understanding of form, the comments from beginners and users new to yoga strongly suggest that the movement complexity is manageable for most beginners. Given the mention of flexibility improvements and relaxing effects, there is a mild consideration for 'Intermediate', as users with some minimal prior yoga experience may integrate additional nuances into the practice.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a 22-minute yoga session, characterized as 'gentle', intended for beginners and as a recovery session for athletes. The primary focus is on stretching and breathing, not intense physical exertion. This warrants a 'Light' effort difficulty rating. The description and comments highlight its suitability for easy rest days and its role in tension release and flexibility, indicating low energy expenditure. However, due to the session's 22-minute duration, which may slightly elevate effort for users previously inactive, there is some overlap into the 'Moderate' category, especially for those not accustomed to sustained activity durations.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is strongly oriented towards 'Beginner', resonating with explicit directives for new practitioners and the beginner-friendly comments. With the inclusion of options for athletes and a practice duration slightly over 20 minutes, it also accommodates 'Intermediate' users looking to recover or improve flexibility. The simplicity of the practice aligns with the lower spectrum of fitness levels. Despite its simplicity, more experienced practitioners ('Advanced') engaging in this routine as a method for relaxation or flexibility enhancement can derive benefit, suggesting a broader application across fitness levels, especially considering the encouraging user testimonials on life improvements and pain relief."
