  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title and description of the video indicate that the workout is a stretch routine designed to improve mobility and flexibility. While the description mentions 'no equipment' explicitly, it also suggests using a 'mat for extra comfort'. This implies that although a mat is not strictly required, it is recommended for comfort during stretching exercises. Consequently, a mat is classified with high confidence (0.7) as it is strongly implied as useful, even though not labeled as essential."
