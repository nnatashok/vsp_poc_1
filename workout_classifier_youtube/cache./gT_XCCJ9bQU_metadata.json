    "To everyone that just started working out and stumble upon this video, DO NOT give up. I know at first it seems hard, I stop myself halfway through (my body screaming at me not to continue \ud83d\ude02 always try to push yourself but listen to your body at the same time). I do this twice a day, alternating with other workouts vid and a week later I can do this full video in one time (not at emi\u2019s pace yet but I\u2019m aiming for it \ud83d\udd25). Go at your own pace, what important is DON\u2019T give up. We can do this! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udd25"
