  "title": "30 MIN PILATES WORKOUT || Mat Pilates With Weights (Intermediate)",
  "description": "This 30 Minute Mat Pilates class works the entire body but with a special focus on strengthening the core. I recommend using 1kg-2kg weights but don't worry if you don't have weights as you can still enjoy the class without them. You could also be creative and use household objects like cans of beans or bottles of water to act as weights! I hope you enjoy it. \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\ud83e\udd0d \u00bfHablas espa\u00f1ol?

    "I absolutely love your workouts with weights. I had to quit my Yoga/Pilates classes at a local studio because it was so expensive. It is such a blessing to be able to do them online for free. Thank you so much for all the time and effort you put into every class. And for giving us so many options.",
    "I absolutely adore these intermediate videos with weights. This was truly amazing and Nicole has changed my life with her workouts! I do them everyday and I\u2019ve never felt stronger!"
