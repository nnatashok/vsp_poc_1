  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is primarily categorized as Beginner to Intermediate. The breathing techniques involved, such as the Belly Chest Out breath and breath holds, do not require complex coordination or advanced body awareness. The instructions emphasize laying down for relaxation, further simplifying technique for beginners. However, the mention of Psychedelic Breathwork\u2014typically more advanced\u2014introduces a slight increase in complexity, justifying an inclusion of the Intermediate level as well.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is primarily Light, given the 19-minute duration and the nature of breathwork focusing on relaxation and calmness. The only physical challenge comes from controlling breathing, including breath holds of up to 1:30, which may slightly increase effort, warranting a Moderate score due to the intense focus required and potential mental challenge experienced during prolonged breath holds.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is classified as Beginner to Intermediate. The Beginner score reflects the simplicity and accessibility of breathwork exercises. The Intermediate score accounts for the mental and emotional focus required for prolonged breath holds and the intensity described in psychedelic experience adaptations. The commentary on emotional release and consciousness alteration suggests Intermediate users might better navigate the mental aspects, though physically it's accessible to Beginners."
