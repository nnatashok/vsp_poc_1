  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily categorized as 'Calisthenics' with a high confidence score of 0.9 due to the channel name 'Hybrid Calisthenics' and the repeated emphasis throughout the metadata on exercises like pushups, pullups, squats, which are typical bodyweight exercises used in calisthenics. The channel focuses extensively on teaching calisthenics, as evident from both the title 'Home Workout for Beginners' and the detailed progression links in the description for various calisthenic exercises. \n\nThe 'Body weight' category is assigned with a score of 0.8 as it strongly overlaps with calisthenics; the exercises mentioned (pushups, pullups, squats) are bodyweight exercises since no equipment is explicitly mentioned for these basic movements. The comments from viewers about following progressions like 'pushups on the kitchen counter' reinforce the home and equipment-free nature of the workout.\n\nWhile the video is aimed at beginners, there's no direct mention of equipment or fitness categories like yoga or Pilates, so these categories were not included. The comment section reflects positive engagement with basic bodyweight exercises and a focus on building foundational strength, further supporting this classification."
