  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' is assigned with a score of 0.7 because the cycling workout is music-driven, as indicated by explicit song references in the description. The smooth transitions between segments like warm-up, speed increases, climbs, sprints, and cool down suggest an emphasis on rhythm and seamless movement. Evidence from the description and use of music playlist links further supports this classification.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is given a score of 0.6. The workout follows a clearly defined progression with labeled segments for warming up, increasing speed, climbing, sprinting, and cooling down. The methodical progression indicates organized, planned training, typical of a beginner cycling class. The title reinforcing 'for beginners' implies structured guidance instrumental for novice progress.\n\nOther spirits were not applicable. 'High-Energy & Intense' was considered but not included due to the beginner focus, lowering intensity. The absence of outdoor environment excluded 'Outdoor & Adventure', while no mention of athletics or agility ruled out 'Sport & Agility'. 'Soothing & Restorative' was not applicable as the workout was more energetic, not focused on relaxation or recovery."
