  "vibesExplanation": "The video 'Advanced Breathing - Ultimate Relaxation Exercise | 3 Minute Breath-Hold | Deep Pranayama Relaxation' is primarily aligned with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe, scoring a strong 0.8. This is due to its focus on deep breathing techniques and breath retention aimed at resetting the nervous system, as indicated by phrases like 'reset nervous system' and 'deep breathing retention'. These elements strongly resonate with a nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement feeling of The Deep Recharge.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Zen Flow' vibe is applicable at a score of 0.7. The metadata describes the exercise as grounding and breath-centered, evident in the emphasis on controlled breathing and gradual progression of extended breath-holds, which makes it a fit for a grounding, intentional experience typical of The Zen Flow.\n\nPotential vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Reboot Workout' were considered but excluded since the workout focuses more on relaxation than repetitive task completion or physical recovery."
