  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled '20 MIN CALORIE KILLER HIIT WORKOUT - Full body Cardio, No Equipment, No Repeat' explicitly states 'No Equipment' in both the title and description. Additionally, the tags reinforce this by including phrases like 'cardio hiit workout no equipment' and 'full body hiit workout no equipment'. The description further clarifies that this is a full body workout with 45-second exercise intervals followed by 15-second rest intervals, designed to burn 300-400 calories. There is no mention or implication of using any specific equipment in the comments, tags, or any other metadata provided. Given this clear and consistent emphasis on a no-equipment workout, the confidence level for requiring no equipment is very high, leading to the conclusion that this workout is entirely bodyweight-based."
