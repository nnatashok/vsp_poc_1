  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled 'Advanced Power Breathing | TAKE A DEEP BREATH' fits well with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe, scoring 0.8 due to its focus on breathwork that resets the nervous system, as indicated by the description of deep breathing rounds and meditation aspects. The incorporation of Wim Hof techniques emphasizes physiological relaxation and recovery, aligning with 'The Deep Recharge'. The 'Zen Flow' is also relevant (score 0.7) given the breath-centered and intentional nature of the exercises, promoting mindfulness and tranquility as highlighted by phrases like 'eliminate stress' and 'sharpen focus'. Lastly, 'The Reboot Workout' is applicable with a score of 0.6, reflecting the video\u2019s goal of energy boosting and stress management through breathing. Other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded due to the lack of high physical intensity or explosive movement."
