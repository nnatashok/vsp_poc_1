  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily focused on 'pranayama', which are breathing exercises inherent to yoga practices. The title, description, and tags, such as 'guided pranayama for beginners', 'easy pranayama techniques', 'breathing exercises for relaxation', and 'pranayama for stress relief', strongly indicate that the primary activity is breathing exercises, justifying a high score of 0.9 for the 'Breathing exercises' category. \n\n'Meditation' is assigned a secondary category with a score of 0.7 because pranayama often overlaps with meditative practices, aiming to promote relaxation and mental clarity, as suggested by tags like 'guided meditation and pranayama'. The description emphasizes controlling energy and enhancing mental clarity, which aligns with meditative goals.\n\n'Yoga' is included with a score of 0.6 because pranayama is a part of yogic traditions. The channel name and the description mention yoga education, further supporting a connection, albeit the specific focus is on pranayama, not asana-based yoga practices. The absence of physical yoga sequences or postures keeps the score lower than for the main category."
