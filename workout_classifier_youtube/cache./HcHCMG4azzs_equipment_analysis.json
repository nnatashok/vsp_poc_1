  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The provided YouTube workout video appears to require no additional equipment beyond the participant's body. The title and tags emphasize it is a 'standing cardio workout' with 'no jumping,' indicating that the exercises are likely bodyweight and focus on low-impact movements standing up. There are no mentions of equipment such as mats, dumbbells, or any other items in the title, description, or tags, confirming that this is a bodyweight session. The channel name 'The Girl With The Pilates Mat' suggests a focus on pilates, which often involves mats, but the absence of any reference to mats in this specific video's metadata suggests they are not necessary for this workout. Therefore, with high confidence, the workout is classified as bodyweight only."
