  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as a 'Body weight' workout with a score of 0.8, as the title '20 Minute Full Body Workout At Home - No Equipment' and the description both emphasize a workout performed without equipment, specifically mentioning 'body-weight' exercises multiple times. The tags also reinforce this with terms like 'body weight workout' and 'body weight exercise'. Additionally, the channel's focus on effective body weight workouts supports this classification.\n\nThe 'Mat' category is also applicable with a score of 0.6, as the exercises are designed to be performed at home, likely involving general floor exercises where a mat might be used for comfort, even though it's not explicitly mentioned. The presence of phrases like 'full body workout' and user comments emphasizing a lack of equipment suggests exercises that are often done on the floor, like planks, push-ups, or similar activities.\n\nOther categories such as HIIT or Weight workout were considered but excluded due to the absence of high-intensity-specific language or use of weights and equipment."
