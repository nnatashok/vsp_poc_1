  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of 'Structured & Disciplined' is strongly evidenced by the video's emphasis on 'proper technique instruction' and 'structured methodology' as seen in the description. This is a beginner-oriented, methodical yoga routine designed to teach the fundamentals with precision. The high score (0.85) reflects the clear focus on technique and structure.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also significant, given the focus on beginners finding relief despite inflexibility. Phrases like 'encouraging dialogue' and 'easy-to-follow' indicate a calming approach, indicating a strong restorative element, thus scoring 0.75.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is moderately present, as yoga naturally involves flowing movements and rhythm, albeit this video de-emphasizes traditional music-driven flow, highlighted by user comments appreciating the absence of music. Therefore, this spirit scores a 0.55 for its implicit presence.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to the video's non-competitive, indoor, and relaxed nature focused on technique rather than high intensity or outdoor activities."
