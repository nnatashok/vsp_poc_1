  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for this video suggests that the primary equipment needed is a mat. This is supported by the description, which includes a direct link encouraging users to \"grab your YOGA MATS here,\" implying that a mat is important for performing the exercises provided in the workout. The mention of yoga mats and a high-intensity workout routine usually suggests exercises on the floor, reinforcing the need for a mat to provide comfort and safety during such exercises. While the workout is described as a bodyweight HIIT cardio workout, the emphasis on needing a mat is clear and thus scores a high confidence of 0.9. No other specific equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata."
