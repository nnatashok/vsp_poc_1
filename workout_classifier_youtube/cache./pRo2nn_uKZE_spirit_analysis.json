  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary Workout Spirit of this video is 'High-Energy & Intense', as indicated by the use of HIIT elements and cardio components mentioned in the description ('increase your calorie burn'). The emphasis on muscle challenge and intensity is echoed in comments like 'yet it challenges every muscle in my body' and 'this is missing the fire in the title..lol \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25It is an intense workout'. These elements justify a score of 0.8.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Structured & Disciplined', as shown by the focus on building 'muscle and strength using compound movements and a variation in tempo per exercise'. The structured approach is highlighted in the comments, with some users indicating they followed along accurately and appreciated the workout's systematic nature ('I will try this slowly & accurately'). Thus, a score of 0.6 is appropriate.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were not supported by the metadata due to the workout's focus on intensity and structured strength building rather than smooth, gentle, or flow-based movements or recovery."
