  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title and description clearly indicate that this is a '20 min STANDING DUMBBELL WORKOUT' aimed at a full body sculpt and strengthen routine, explicitly mentioning the use of 'two 10LB weights.' The tags also reinforce this by including phrases like 'medium dumbbells,' '10lb dumbbells,' and 'dumbbell workout,' which all suggest the necessity of dumbbells for performing the exercises. The description emphasizes grabbing equipment for the workout, pointing specifically to dumbbells as essential. With all sources aligning with the same requirement, the confidence in needing dumbbells is very high, at 1.0."
