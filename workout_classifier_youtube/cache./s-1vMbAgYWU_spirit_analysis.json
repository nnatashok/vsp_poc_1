  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the workout is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.9. This is strongly indicated by the use of terms like 'vinyasa flow', 'feel good flow', and 'flow together', suggesting a smooth, continuous movement pattern that aligns with the yoga practice's emphasis on coordination and mind-body connection. The mention of a 'vinyasa flow yoga class' and the tag 'yoga flow' further corroborate this. \n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Soothing & Restorative', with a score of 0.7, inferred from the focus on flexibility and stretching, which are typically gentle and restorative actions. Comments like feeling 'so good in my body', and descriptors such as 'yummy intermediate yoga' and 'feeling really good' support this soothing nature. However, the dynamic elements typical of vinyasa, lead it to be not solely restorative. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are not applicable due to the non-competitive, gentle nature of the activity, and 'Outdoor & Adventure' is excluded as the practice takes place indoors, likely on a yoga mat with no outdoor elements involved."
