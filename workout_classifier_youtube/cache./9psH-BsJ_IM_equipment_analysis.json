  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video explicitly describes a 20-minute bodyweight cardio workout, emphasizing 'NO EQUIPMENT' in the title and tags, such as \"no equipment workout\" and \"bodyweight workout\". The description further details exercises that require no equipment, focusing on movements that can be performed standing or in motion, such as arm swings, high marches, and pivot punches. The tags reinforce this by repeating 'no equipment workout' and 'bodyweight workout'. User comments do not mention any equipment either. Overall, there is a very high confidence level that no equipment is needed for this workout, as all metadata sources consistently indicate a bodyweight-only session."
