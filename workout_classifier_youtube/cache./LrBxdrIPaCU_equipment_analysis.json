  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video clearly focuses on a cycling workout, as evident from the title 'Level Up Your Cadence | 10 Minute Cycling Workout' and repeated references to cycling and cycling workouts in the tags and description. The inclusion of terms like 'spin', 'indoor cycling', 'spinning class', and 'bike workout' strongly suggests the need for an Exercise bike. The session breakdown involves various intensity levels of RPM (revolutions per minute), a metric typically associated with stationary cycling workouts using an exercise bike. The channel's alignment towards indoor cycling workouts further supports this requirement. Therefore, the confidence level for needing an Exercise bike is very high at 0.95."
