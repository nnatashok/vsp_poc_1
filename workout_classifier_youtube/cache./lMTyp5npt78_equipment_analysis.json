  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Upper Back Love | Yoga For Back Pain' suggests a yoga session, which typically requires a mat to provide a comfortable and stable surface for performing yoga poses. The description mentions using 'yoga asana,' which indicates the practice of yoga postures where a mat is commonly utilized. The tags include 'free yoga videos,' 'yoga at home,' and 'beginners yoga,' further implying that having a mat would be beneficial, especially for those practicing on different surfaces at home. Given that no other equipment is explicitly mentioned or implied, the mat is identified with very high confidence (0.9) as central to this yoga workout."
