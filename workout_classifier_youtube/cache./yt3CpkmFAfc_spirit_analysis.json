  "spiritsExplanation": "The video exhibits a strong \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit, as evidenced by the focus on relieving neck and shoulder tension, enhancing posture, and ensuring comfort throughout the exercises. The repeated emphasis on pain-free execution and terms like \"relieve tension\" and \"gentle stretch\" in the description aligns with restorative qualities, warranting a high score of 0.9. Additionally, user comments corroborate its effectiveness for pain relief and tension alleviation, reinforcing this classification.\n\nThe spirit of \"Structured & Disciplined\" is present with a moderate score of 0.6, as the routine follows a methodical approach with step-by-step guidance through a series of specific exercises, each with detailed posture instructions and repetitions. However, the video's primary intention leans more towards restoration rather than precision, thus the relatively lower score.\n\nOther spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Flow & Rhythm\" were excluded due to the calm nature of the exercises and lack of high-intensity or rhythmic elements. \"Outdoor & Adventure\" and \"Sport & Agility\" were also irrelevant given the indoor, therapeutic context."
