    "I like how you got straight and to the point. No rambling on with long speeches, just a quick intorduction and then straight to business.",
    "I lost more than 100 lbs with this video. Thank you so much. I was 314 pounds, now I weigh 212.6 lbs  and man do I feel good.",
    "I love how he shows examples and then he actually does the workout with the viewer! It&#39;s uncut and real! I&#39;m very motivated to do this!",
    "LISTEN UP EVERYONE! STOP DOING THE EXERCISES WITHOUT WARMING UP! Do some swings and stretch your muscles. Thats why you feel tired after a minute. Your muscles and limbs need to be at the right temperature to do it\u2019s max potential. What i do is some light swing-exercises and to get my pulse up i do some jumps. Then i round it off with some shadow boxing. Hope you found this helpful! <br><br>EDIT: Remember to drink as much water as your body needs an hour or two before. Remember the 1-2 method. Eat and drink 1 to 2 hours before working out.",
