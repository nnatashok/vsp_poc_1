  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises described (table top crunches, crunch pulses, hip raises, leg lowers, etc.) generally involve straightforward movements, suitable for those at a beginner level. However, exercises like 'side plank oblique lifts' and 'on elbows tuck to extension' require some balance and core strength, indicating a low-end intermediate complexity. Comments mentioning participants needing practice show varying difficulty perceptions.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 10-minute session, which limits the overall volume, keeping energy expenditure moderate. It's labeled as a 'finisher' or solo session, which might lean towards moderate effort for fit individuals, but for the target audience, maintaining continuous core work with minimal rest can be quite exerting. Comments reporting fatigue and challenge contribute to it's potential to be more exerting for less fit users.",
