  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is titled as a 'Beginners Gentle Pilates Flow,' emphasizing that it targets newcomers to Pilates or those looking for a gentle exercise routine. The tags repeatedly mention 'gentle,' 'beginner,' and 'at-home workout,' suggesting simple movements suitable for those with little experience. The description also confirms it is a 'gentle Pilates Mat Workout for Beginners.' User comments praise the workout for being genuinely beginner-friendly and easy to follow, further supporting a 'Beginner' classification. A slight consideration for 'Intermediate' is included due to the potential need for coordination and core control typical in Pilates, suggesting some users might find it slightly more challenging, but the main focus and audience are beginners.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'gentle,' indicating low energy expenditure, a defining characteristic of 'Light' effort. The workout duration is a bit over 20 minutes, but the tags and description do not suggest high intensity. The commenters indicate the session is truly gentle and accessible, thus the primary category is 'Light.' However, some aspects of Pilates, such as maintaining positions and engaging specific muscle groups, can create a moderate level of effort, justifying a small attribution to 'Moderate' difficulty.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the workout's description, tags, and emphasis on being gentle and beginner-friendly, a 'Beginner' fitness level is most appropriate. The metadata and user comments strongly support this being accessible to those new to exercise. The video duration slightly over 20 minutes introduces potential challenges for complete novices, especially in maintaining focus and energy, suggesting a minor inclusion of 'Intermediate' could be appropriate for some aspects of Pilates coordination and stability. Overall, it is primarily suited for beginners, but individuals with minimal fitness experience may also benefit."
