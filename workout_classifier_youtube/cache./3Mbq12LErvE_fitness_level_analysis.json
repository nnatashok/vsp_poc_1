  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is titled \"10 MIN BEGINNER FLOOR STRETCHES\" and includes tags such as \"beginner,\" \"beginner workouts,\" and \"yoga for beginners,\" which suggest very simple, straightforward movements with minimal coordination required. The description highlights the stretching being done entirely on the floor, further indicating low technical complexity. Comments and metadata confirm this is accessible for those who may struggle with other beginner routines.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is assessed as 'Light' based on the short duration (10 minutes) and the nature of the workout, which is floor-based stretching. The video is intended for beginners, and the comments indicate it's suitable for deconditioned individuals. The light intensity is further supported by keywords such as 'low impact' and 'yoga for flexibility' in the tags.",

    }
  ],
  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.95,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner,' with a perfect alignment score due to the explicit focus on beginners seen in the title, tags, and user comments celebrating its accessibility to those out of shape. There is also some alignment with 'Intermediate' because even beginners with some prior exercise experience could benefit, as they might push themselves further with added stretches or more focus, hence the secondary score. The video\u2019s encouragement of beginners and lightweight nature justifies a strong beginner level classification."
