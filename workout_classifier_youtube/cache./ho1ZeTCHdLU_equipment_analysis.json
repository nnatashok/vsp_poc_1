  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is explicitly centered on treadmill workouts, as indicated in both the title ('BEST BEGINNER Tread Workout for 15 MINUTES') and the repeated mentions in the tags ('treadmill workout', 'how to treadmill', 'free treadmill workout', 'running treadmill workout for beginners'). The description further emphasizes that this is a 15-minute treadmill run with intervals for running and recovery, further supporting the need for a treadmill. User comments underline the workout as a treadmill exercise, with mentions of using it indoors as an alternative to outside running. Therefore, the treadmill is identified with very high confidence as the sole required equipment for this workout."
