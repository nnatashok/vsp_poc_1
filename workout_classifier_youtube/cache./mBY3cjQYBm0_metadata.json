    "I lost 40 pounds since November and a stationary bike was a big part of that. I\u2019ve got a bad knee and the bike was zero impact and strengthened my legs, helping my knee pain too. With that, I lifted three days a week and tracked my calorie intake. I feel great, and in better shape than ever since college, and I\u2019m 51!",
    "I&#39;m 52 and I&#39;m in the best shape of my life. I&#39;ve been riding a stationary bike for a minimum of an hour everyday since Jan. 11, 2023. I wake up at 3:30am Monday through Friday, on Saturday and Sunday I do it whenever I can fit it in. I weigh my food and I count my calories. This has become a lifestyle for me and I absolutely love it.",
    "I suffer from depression, anxiety and gaming addiction. Thanks to you guys i overcome all of it and became more active in exercise. I recently bought a yesoul stationary bike and some weight lifting equipment. I do stationary bike about 3-4hrs in the morning and weight lifting in the afternoon in midnight I also do light cycling in stationary about 2hrs. Before this I weigh about 120kg that was october of 2023 and now February 2024 I weigh about 90kg. Cycling and weight lifting really changed my life. I hope this continues",
    "I totally agree with cardio early in the morning. There&#39;s always something getting in the way of my cardio session throughout the day. It has bothered me for months.",
    "I enjoy walking on my treadmill with or without my weighted vest on the highest incline (15), lifting heavy weights and riding my spin bike and road bike.  Having a home gym is a blessing. <br><br>Variety is key. <br>Looking excellent Paul. \ud83d\udc9b"
