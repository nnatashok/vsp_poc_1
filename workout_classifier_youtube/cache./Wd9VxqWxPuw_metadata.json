  "title": "20 Minute Spin Class Workout (FAT BURNING INDOOR CYCLING!!)",
  "description": "Best fat burning workouts can be found in our 90 day fitness program\nhttp://athleanx.com/x/best-fat-burn\n\nThis 20 minute spin class workout is a great fat burning indoor cycling routine.  This spin class workout includes intervals of high intensity spinning followed by periods of lower intensity indoor cycling.  It\u2019s a great idea to include indoor cycling class in your workout plan one to two days per week on days that you\u2019re not lifting weights.\n\nThis 20 minute spinning workout will get your heart rate pumping and help you burn fat and calories.  You can do this indoor cycling workout at home if you\u2019ve got a stationary or spinning bike, or it can be done in the gym.  You\u2019ll need to adjust the resistance on your spinning bike to make sure you\u2019re working harder during the high intensity intervals, and let up on the resistance a little bit during the lower intensity periods.\n\nA 20 minute indoor cycling workout is the perfect amount  of time to give your metabolism a boost to help burn fat.  However too much cardio exercise can actually waste away at your muscle tone.  Make sure to keep spinning workouts to a maximum of 2 per week.\n\nFor all the best fat burning and strength training workouts, subscribe to our Youtube channel  https://www.youtube.com/user/womensworkouts",

    "I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say this video changed my life. I started my exercise habit about 3 years ago with this video and I come back again and again. Thank you AmyJo!",
    "I recently began spinning again after a lengthy period of not spinning.  By far athleanxx have the best workouts to get me back into it.",
    "Nice and simple workout. Love the authentic enthusiasm and effort of Amy. Love that the music is only in the background. I would only recommend putting a visual for the sprint times and intensity. It would really help. Thank you.",
    "Perfect workout! Loved the amount of talking she did, not to much, not to little. Most talkers get on my nerves working out. I will be doing her workout often!!!! Thanks...",
    "I\u2019ve just begun working out on a spin bike .... you kicked this 58yr olds butt!!  Loved it !!!"
