  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated between Intermediate and Advanced because this is a spin class requiring coordination for speed and resistance adjustments. The description emphasizes using a 'pyramid structure' and the importance of recalibrating resistance settings, indicating a need for knowledge of indoor cycling form and technique. However, as cycling inherently involves straightforward lower body movement, it's not rated Expert. Intermediate level is strong due to necessary control over multiple resistance levels and speed variations, while Advanced is present but less dominant due to specific cues for increasing resistance and the structured intervals mentioned.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a high effort difficulty, likely Challenging to Extreme for users in low physical condition. It is a 40-minute HIIT session with high energy activity such as sprints, jumps, and climbs with multiple pyramids, indicating high cardiovascular and muscular demand. User comments describe the session as 'challenging' and one of the hardest compared to previous classes, reinforcing significant energy expenditure. This leads us to classify it primarily as Challenging, with a slight lean towards Extreme due to the described structured intensity variations and resistance adjustments.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulty levels, the required fitness level for this workout spans Intermediate to Advanced. Although the technique difficulty aligns well with Intermediate users familiar with cycling, the effort required, especially the 40-minute duration designed to burn calories and push past plateaus, leans towards Advanced. Comments from users who have done the workout multiple times indicate it as particularly challenging. Therefore, while it is suitable for those at an Intermediate fitness level who are undertaking regular cycling or HIIT workouts, it would also push towards an Advanced level for those seeking a more rigorous session."
