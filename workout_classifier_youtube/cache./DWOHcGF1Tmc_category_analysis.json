  "categoriesExplanation": "The video title 'Guided Meditation for Children | Your Secret Treehouse | Relaxation for Kids' and tags such as 'Guided Meditation for Children' and 'Meditation for Kids' explicitly indicate that the main focus of the content is on meditation, aimed at children. This is further supported by the description referring to a journey to a 'peaceful place' for relaxation, which aligns with meditation's purpose of tranquility and emotional management. Thus, 'Meditation' is assigned a score of 1, indicating it is the primary workout category with very high confidence.\n\nThe score of 0.3 for 'Breathing exercises' is based on the implicit relaxation techniques that are likely included within the guided meditation, as part of establishing calmness and reducing stress or anxiety. However, without explicit mention of breathing exercises, it is a secondary aspect, hence the lower score.\n\nOther categories were excluded due to the lack of any physical exercise components or direct references that would align with them, as the channel specifically focuses on meditative and relaxation content suitable for children."
