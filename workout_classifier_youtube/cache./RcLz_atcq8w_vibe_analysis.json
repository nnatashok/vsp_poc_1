  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Warrior Workout' with a score of 0.7, based on the high-intensity, sweat-dripping nature described in the tags and description. The words 'HIIT', 'high intensity', 'full body', and 'burn fat fast' suggest a challenging and primal workout experience, typical of the 'Warrior' vibe. \n\n'The Firestarter' vibe scores a 0.65, reflecting the workout's short, 20-minute duration with explosive intensity as seen in the 'burn 500 calories' claim and '30s work, 15s rest' structure. This represents a fast, devastating workout experience often associated with HIIT.\n\nAdditionally, there's a presence of 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, scoring 0.45, since user comments highlight a feel-good post-exercise effect and the workout's ability to elevate energy and boost metabolism over a sustained period (calorie 'after burn'). This complements the elevated energy and steady build of endorphin levels typical of this vibe.\n\nAlternative vibes, such as 'The Groove Session' or 'The Nightclub Workout,' were excluded due to the lack of dance or rhythm-based elements and an absence of music emphasis. While the 'Adrenaline Rush' label could fit due to intensity, this workout's structured nature with no obstacles or unpredictability rules it out."
