  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The primary and likely only piece of equipment required for this workout is a chair. This is confirmed by the title of the video \"10 DAY - 10 MIN CHAIR WORKOUT To Lose BELLY FAT!\" and reinforced by the tags such as \"chair workout\" and \"chair workout for abs.\" Additionally, the description of the video explicitly mentions that it is a chair workout, emphasizing its use for individuals with back problems and targeting belly fat. There is no mention of any other equipment in the title, tags, or description, nor is there any indication in the comments that other equipment is required or used. Therefore, the confidence score for the chair being the required equipment is very high at 1.0."
