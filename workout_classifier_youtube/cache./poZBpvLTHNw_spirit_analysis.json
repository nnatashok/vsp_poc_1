  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under \"Flow & Rhythm\" due to the emphasis on continuous, smooth movement as indicated by the repeated mention of 'yoga flow' in the title and tags, reflecting a focus on coordination and integration with breath. The channel's background in dance and Pilates further supports this classification, as does the music-driven environment hinted at through the Epidemic Sound mention. A score of 0.9 is assigned due to the highly rhythmic nature implied by 'flow' and the channel's emphasis on feeling good through movement.\n\n\"Soothing & Restorative\" is the secondary classification, emphasized by the phrases 'Feel Good Yoga Flow' and 'breathe, stretch and feel good' in the description, suggesting a focus on relaxation and emotional well-being. Comments highlight emotional benefits such as navigating difficult emotions and feeling grateful and relaxed, which align with restorative qualities. A score of 0.8 is given due to clear indicators of a calming and restorative purpose, albeit slightly less pronounced than the flow aspect.\n\nOther spirits were not considered as the metadata strongly indicates a focus on rhythmic, soothing yoga."
