  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"High-Energy & Intense\" with a score of 1.0 due to several explicit indicators: the title includes 'ADVANCED HIIT [Intense Workout with Weights]', the description and tags repeatedly emphasize high-intensity training, and user comments describe it as challenging and sweat-inducing. This is reinforced by the detailed workout routine breakdown involving high-intensity exercises like jump squats and burpees, and the interval training structure of 40 seconds of work followed by 20 seconds of rest. \n\nAdditionally, \"Structured & Disciplined\" is assigned with a score of 0.7 because the video is part of a progressive program ('6 Week Shred'), suggesting a well-organized and methodical approach. The structured interval format and progression through various exercise formats (bodyweight and weighted HIIT) further support this classification. The users\u2019 comments reflect disciplined continuation and completion of the program, enhancing the score.\n\nOther spirits like \"Flow & Rhythm\" and \"Soothing & Restorative\" are excluded as the focus is on intensity and results, not fluidity or relaxation."
