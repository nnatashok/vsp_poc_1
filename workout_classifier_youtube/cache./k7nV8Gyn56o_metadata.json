  "description": "SUCH A KILLER ROUTINE - but you won't notice while you're training (because it's also kind of happy). I was dripping sweat after only 1 round! \u2665\ufe0e Cardio is fun today! / Werbung\n\nomg I am so exciteeeeeed! \nA combination of your (and my :D) favorite parts of the 15min Happy Dance, 12min Happy Sweat, 12min Happy Cardio & 10min R&B Dance. Basically, it's mostly about the last, super high energy songs! The parts that we put all our energy into, that we sweat it all out & feel so happy afterwards. \n\nThis is my favorite HIIT workout ever now. It's SUPER DUPER intense, will kick your ass, but it will also kick the 12min Happy Cardio from it's throne haha. At least for my personal taste. Let me know what you think!!! \n\n\u25b8 burn lots of calories \n\u25b8 improve your endurance \n\u25b8 main muscles worked: thighs, butt, abs (from all the high knees)\n\u25b8 boost your mood & just be happyyyyy\n\nPS: thanks for helping me decide about the workout parts on Insta Stories!
