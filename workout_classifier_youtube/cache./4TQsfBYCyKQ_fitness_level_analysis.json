  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video focuses on gentle, restorative yoga designed to release tension and stress, as indicated by the metadata and the practice's intent to relax the body and mind. The poses involved are likely to be simple and involve basic stretching, aligning with 'Beginner' level technique difficulty. The reference to being 'super gentle' supports this classification. However, the inclusion of potential mindfulness techniques slightly elevates the complexity to also include a minor 'Intermediate' score due to the subtle coordination and body awareness raised by the mental concentration and relaxation techniques.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video's primary focus is on stretching and relaxation before bedtime, suggesting very low physical intensity, appropriate for 'Light' effort difficulty. There is mention of soothing tension and promoting sleep rather than inducing physical exhaustion, reinforcing the 'Light' classification. While primarily light, a minor 'Moderate' score is included due to possible emotional and minor physical engagement indicated by comments about emotional release.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given that the yoga session is designed to be gentle and focuses on stretching and relaxation, it's accessible to a 'Beginner' fitness level, especially since it emphasizes self-compassion and emotional release over physical challenge. The short duration (12:49) also supports its suitability for beginners. An 'Intermediate' level is included with a lower score to acknowledge the potential for slightly heightened mindfulness or emotional engagement, as suggested in the comments about its cathartic effect."
