  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.9. The title and description emphasize mental balance, grounding, and relaxation, evident in phrases such as 'mental and emotional self,' 'balance and clarity,' 'soften,' and 'Settle in.' User comments further reinforce this spirit, discussing feelings of peace, stillness, and use in reducing stress and anxiety. Additionally, the presence of tags such as 'relaxation techniques' and 'yoga for stress relief' underline the restorative focus.\n\nThe spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' is assigned a low score of 0.3, primarily due to the potential for meditative practices to embody smooth and rhythmic breathing or movement patterns, although this is not explicitly emphasized in the video metadata. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the video\u2019s focus on calmness and meditation rather than physical exertion or athletic skills. 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are also not relevant, as the session is indoor and less methodical or progressive in structure."
