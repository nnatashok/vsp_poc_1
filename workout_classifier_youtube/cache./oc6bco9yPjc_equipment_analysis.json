  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for the video titled \"Guided 100 Squat Workout!\" suggests that this workout is focused on performing 100 squats, which is a bodyweight exercise. There is no mention of any specific equipment requirement in the title, description, or top comments. The description highlights that the workout series is designed to be performed at home or in the gym, without specifying any equipment, implying that it is a bodyweight workout aimed at lower body fitness. The absence of any keywords related to equipment like dumbbells or resistance bands further supports that equipment is not needed. Thus, it appears that the workout is bodyweight only, and no additional equipment is required."
