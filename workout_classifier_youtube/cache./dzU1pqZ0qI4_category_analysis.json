  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Pilates' with a high confidence (score of 0.8). This is because the workout emphasizes Pilates principles and movements, which is evident from the title '35 MIN CARDIO PILATES,' the description mentioning a 'Cardio Pilates Workout,' and the tags heavily focusing on various combinations of 'pilates' associated with full body workouts. Additionally, the channel's core focus is Pilates, as Nicole is a certified Pilates instructor.\n\nThe secondary category is 'HIIT' with a moderate confidence (score of 0.6). This is due to the combination of Pilates with athletic cardio flows intended to raise the heart rate, as explicitly mentioned in the description. Comments from viewers suggest a balance between energy-raising and muscle toning, akin to HIIT workouts, like engaging cardio without extensive jumping.\n\nOther potential categories such as 'Body weight' or 'Weight workout' were considered but not selected because the use of light weights was deemed supplementary rather than central to the workout. The primary emphasis clearly remains on Pilates with a cardio focus."
