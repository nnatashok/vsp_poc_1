  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.8 due to several elements that emphasize technical precision and progressive training. The metadata highlights 'time under tension,' which involves slow and controlled movements, indicating a focus on methodology and structure. This approach enhances strength through careful exercise execution, as evidenced by phrases like 'performed slow and controlled' and 'no equipment but can add weights.' This setup supports a disciplined workout spirit.\n\nA secondary spirit, 'High-Energy & Intense,' is identified with a score of 0.6. User comments suggest an increased heart rate and a strong physical challenge, keywords such as 'got my heart rate really up there' indicate intensity. However, the workout is not designed to constantly push limits or be heart-pumping, hence the slightly lower score.\n\nSpirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm,' 'Soothing & Restorative,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to lack of evidence of medium-paced, flow-based, or nature/outdoor components."
