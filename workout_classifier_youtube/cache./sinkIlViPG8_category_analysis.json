  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Weight workout' with a high score of 0.9. The title and description explicitly mention 'strength workout with dumbbells', 'build strength', and 'added resistance', indicating the significant use of weights. The structured workout includes heavy weight lifting (10lbs, 15lbs, and 25lbs) and focuses on building strength, both strong indicators for this category. \n\nThe 'Body weight' category is assigned a score of 0.5. Although the focus is on using dumbbells, some exercises like core training and movements with controlled body motions suggest mixed usage of body weight for stability and execution, implied by 'lean muscle' and 'controlled movements'.\n\nThe 'Mat' category is present due to the mention of using an 'exercise mat or other soft surface', indicating floor-based activities, and described in the breakdown where there's a 'core circuit' which often suggests mat work. However, it is not the main focus, giving it a score of 0.4.\n\nThe tags, the repetition of 'full body', 'strength', and user comments focusing on a full-body strength session further support these categorizations. The channel focuses on at-home workouts, enhancing confidence in the classification as it's in line with their style, leading to high overall category confidence of 0.9."
