  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'dynamic' and 'fast-paced', suggesting a need for coordination and body control typical of intermediate-level technique difficulty. Comments note that some moves can be 'really challenging', hinting at potential advanced techniques without explicitly listing them. The channel is run by a certified Pilates instructor known for offering technically sound workouts, further supporting an intermediate to advanced technique classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video length is just over 18 minutes, which coupled with the description of a 'dynamic and fast-paced' class, suggests a moderate to challenging level of physical demand. Comments describe it as 'tiny but mighty' and capable of inducing a 'burn', indicating significant effort but not to an extreme degree. The emphasis seems to be on consistency and flow rather than high intensity.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Technique and effort difficulty suggest an intermediate fitness level, as it involves coordinated movement patterns. Comments indicating users performing this 'as part of my daily routine' suggest sustained effort over time but also indicate accessibility to motivated beginners. Users are encouraged to repeat the workout to 'get the feel of it', making it more adaptable to varied fitness levels. Therefore, it is suitable for motivated beginners and more fits intermediate users, while also offering a challenge to advanced users due to aerobic and technical aspects."
