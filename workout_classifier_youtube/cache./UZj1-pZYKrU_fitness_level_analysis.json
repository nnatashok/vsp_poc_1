  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is focused on breath work, specifically the \"Wim Hof Method,\" which involves deep breathing and breath holds. The technique required is primarily about controlling breathing patterns, which is straightforward for most individuals. However, it requires a certain amount of mindfulness and body awareness, bumping it slightly into the Intermediate level, especially considering the deep breathing rounds and holds that may require practice to perform correctly. The safety guidelines and potential physical responses mentioned indicate some complexity which increases the technique difficulty slightly beyond beginner.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The breathwork session is 49 minutes long and consists of deep breathing rounds that suggest a continuous and focused effort over an extended period. This duration pushes the effort level to 'Moderate' for most deconditioned users due to sustained concentration and breath holds, which can be mentally and somewhat physically demanding. The description highlights potential physical sensations such as tingling or light-headedness, indicating moderate effort despite no physical movement.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the combination of relatively simple breathing techniques and a moderate effort level due to the length of the session, the required fitness level spans multiple categories. While beginners can attempt this, the duration and breath holds likely make it most suitable for Intermediate users. Advanced users could find challenge in the mental focus required over 49 minutes. Safety warnings suggest some fitness in managing breath and physical responses, contributing to intermediate classification with a slight tip into advanced due to the focus required over the prolonged session duration."
