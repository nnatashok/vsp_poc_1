  "description": "Let's do a full body yoga flow for strength and energy, no props needed!\n\u2764\ufe0f Try my mobile app to get exclusive content! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udcf1 \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/ytmobileapp\n\ud83d\udecd\ufe0f SHOP MY MERCHANDISE, BOOKS & ONLINE COURSES \ud83e\uddd8\ud83d\udc49 https://bit.ly/ywkshop\n\nHey everyone, thanks for stopping by! Lately I've been craving more strength-building yoga classes in my own personal practice so I decided to share this simple but very effective 20 min strength building flow with you. Beginning your day with strength is a fantastic way to wake up and get a boost of energy. This is an intermediate full body vinyasa flow practice with no props required.\n\nOf course, no practice of mine is complete without some stretchy poses added in! I'll be sure to give you some flexibility focused poses towards the end of class so you can stretch everything out and feel really good for the day ahead.\n\nLet me know how this one goes for you!\n\n\ud83d\ude0d MORE MORNING YOGA \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc49 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0v0k7UCVrmvckKAZJVyeLPFKjYYnu9M\n\n\n\u2705 SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET  http://bit.ly/ywkassandra\n\ud83d\udd14 Don\u2019t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!\n\nThanks for watching,\nKassandra\nWEB \u27a1\ufe0f http://www.yogawithkassandra.com\nINSTAGRAM \u27a1\ufe0f https://instagram.com/yoga_with_kassandra\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 MY MOBILE APP \ud83d\udcf1 Stream or download more than 800+ classes, use the in-app calendar to track and schedule classes, new exclusive challenges, classes and programs added every month \u2764\ufe0f FREE TO DOWNLOAD \u2764\ufe0f http://bit.ly/ytmobileapp\n\n\nFREE YOGA CHALLENGES\n\ud83c\udf1e 30 day Morning Yoga Challenge http://bit.ly/morning30days\n\ud83c\udf1b 30 day Evening Yoga Challenge: http://bit.ly/bedtime30\n\ud83e\uddd8 7 day Yoga & Meditation Challenge: http://bit.ly/ywk7day\n\ud83e\udd38 30 day Flexible Body, Flexible Mind Challenge: https://bit.ly/flexbodymind\n\n\nMY PUBLISHED BOOKS & PRODUCTS\n\ud83c\udf3f \"Year of Yoga\" (NEW Book+ Online Program): https://geni.us/yearofyoga\n\ud83c\udfb4 \"I Radiate Joy\" Affirmation Card Deck: https://bit.ly/affirmationdeck\n\u270d\ufe0f \"My Yoga Journey\" Guided Yoga Journal: https://bit.ly/ywkyogajournal\n\ud83d\udcd5 \"Yin Yoga: Stretch the Mindful Way\" Book: http://geni.us/ywkbook\n\ud83c\udf81 \"My Yoga Journey\" GIFT SET journal, candle + book: https://geni.us/giftsetywk\n\n\n\ud83d\uded2 SHOP MY AMAZON FAVORITES \ud83d\udecd\ufe0f\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/yogawithkassandra\n\n\nSTUDY WITH ME\n\ud83c\udf93 30 hour Yin Yoga Teacher Training: https://bit.ly/yinyttkass\n\ud83c\udf93 10 hour Vinyasa Teaching Methodologies: https://bit.ly/yttvinyasa\n\ud83d\udd49\ufe0f 10 hour Yoga Philosophy Course: https://bit.ly/ywkyama\n\u26a1 10 hour Tantra Wisdom Goddesses Course: https://bit.ly/wisdomgoddess\n\n\nYoga with Kassandra - Disclaimer\nPlease consult with your physician before beginning any exercise program.

    "I just wanna say thanks for your channel. I had so much back pain, I lived in fear of my back going out again and then my knees started in on me. I was intimidated by yoga classes and unsure if I could make time or afford it. I\u2019ve been practicing with pretty much just your 10-15min videos almost everyday now for 3 years and my pain is totally under control!\u2764 I appreciate the way you teach with no attitude, judgement or expectation. Just self-acceptance and care. Thank you so much.",
    "This was perfect to start the morning, hope you have a beautiful week everyone\ud83d\udc9b",
    "I love your 10 min morning yoga sessions, but 20 is even better.  My word is &#39;Be&#39;.  Thank you so much!",
    "This is an incredibly chaotic time in the world right now. I really needed this peaceful class. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a"
