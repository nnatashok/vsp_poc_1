  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary classification of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is backed by strong evidence in the title, description, and tags which consistently mention 'deep rest', 'relaxation', 'soothe the nervous system', and 'calm'. Additionally, phrases like 'yogic sleep', 'stress relief', and 'nervous system reset' emphasize the restorative and healing nature of the yoga Nidra practice. The usage of terms such as 'gentle ocean waves' and 'soothing female voice' further reinforce a peaceful and restful experience focused on recovery and stress reduction.\n\nA secondary spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm' is identified with a lower score of 0.3. This is due to the guided nature of the session and the incorporation of rhythmic elements such as ocean waves and voice guidance, which can create a fluid and meditative experience. However, the emphasis remains predominantly on rest and restoration, rather than continuous movement, so the match is mild."
