  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit of this video is 'Soothing & Restorative', with a score of 1.0. This is evident from the video's emphasis on 'stretch and recover', 'improve mobility & flexibility', and 'rest day' in both its title and description. The words 'stretch and recover', 'recharge our bodies and mind', and 'feel grateful for your beautiful body' indicate a focus on relaxation and recovery, which are quintessential aspects of the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The channel itself often posts HIIT and strength workouts, but this video is explicitly targeted toward recovery, evidenced by tags like 'rest day stretch' and 'stretch for sore muscles'. This is further supported by user comments praising the video for its calming and healing effects.\n\nA secondary spirit here is 'Flow & Rhythm', scoring 0.5, due to the 'follow along' style and the smooth transition between stretches, as described in the section '50 sec on, 10 sec off to change to the next stretch'. While it's not the primary focus, the structure suggests a rhythmic, coordinated approach to movement. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', and 'Sport & Agility' are not appropriate for this workout, as it lacks the intensity, methodical technicality, and sport-specific skills typically associated with these spirits."
