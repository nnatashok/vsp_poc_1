I don't want you to focus on burning calories but focus on the calorie readout as a way to make you work harder because the more you kick your own A$$ = the faster you'll lose weight.\n\nYou don't have to use the calories as a guide. You can use the strides per minute to make sure you keep the same high speed throughout the entire workout or you can use the total distance covered.\n\nThis workout is made up of 3 TEN minute sets where you alternate between 45 & 30 second burst with a 60 seconds all out burst at the end but your rest periods get shorter & shorter each time going from 30 seconds all the way down to 10 second breaks.\n\nYou also do not need an elliptical to do this workout. You can also follow along on a treadmill, bike or any other piece of cardio equipment OR you could do it without exercise machines by running back and forth (see this video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfa197Xkvd0), running in place, jumping jacks or ski steps (see this video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq4JVmbmi7E )\n\nHere's the layout of the workout...\n\n\u2022 Go All Out for 45 Seconds\n\u2022 Rest 30 Seconds\n\u2022 Go All Out for 30 Seconds\n\u2022 Rest 20 Seconds\n\u2022 Go All Out for 45 Seconds\n\u2022 Rest 10 Seconds\n\u2022 Go All Out for 30 Seconds\n\u2022 Rest 10 Seconds\n\u2022 Go All Out for 45 Seconds\n\u2022 Rest 20 Seconds\n\u2022 Go All Out for 30 Seconds\n\u2022 Rest 30 Seconds\n\u2022 Go All Out for 45 Seconds\n\u2022 Rest 20 Seconds\n\u2022 Go All Out for 30 Seconds\n\u2022 Rest 10 Seconds\n\u2022 Go All Out for 45 Seconds\n\u2022 Rest 45 Seconds\n\u2022 Go All Out for 60 Seconds\n\u2022 Rest 30-to-60 Seconds & Repeat up to 2 times\n\nYou can of course modify this elliptical workout to make it harder or easier to suit your fitness level but either way you're better off doing one of my easier elliptical workouts or one of my more intense elliptical workouts if this workout ends up being too hard or too easy for you.\n\nIf you're not doing this elliptical workout along with my DVD or on YouTube then it is a good idea for you to go and download the mp3 that accompanies the workout\n\n****************************************************\nMore Elliptical Workouts:\n10 minute Elliptical Workout: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjHaLu6QkdI\n\n24 minute Elliptical Workout: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wi6kARs7Us\n\nJay-z Elliptical workout: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiECI4n365I\n\nYou can download a printable version of this workout along with the mp3 for motivation here: http://www.nowloss.com/elip \n\n****************************************************\nI'm Adrian Bryant & I'm the guy who created NowLoss.com to help you look good naked.
