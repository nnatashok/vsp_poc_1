The title '30 MINUTE HIIT | Treadmill Workout Follow Along #IBXRunning' explicitly mentions both HIIT and treadmill, which are reinforced by the tags 'Treadmill workout,' 'HIIT workout,' and 'interval workout.' The description further clarifies the workout structure as a HIIT session involving run and recovery intervals designed for treadmill use, including speed and incline suggestions. Comments emphasize the HIIT nature, referencing the interval structure and personalized pacing. Both categories, \"HIIT\" and \"Treadmill,\" are assigned a high score of 0.9 due to clear indicators in the title, description, and comments showcasing these elements as central to the workout."
