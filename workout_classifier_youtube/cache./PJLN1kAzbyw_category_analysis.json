  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Pilates' with a high confidence score of 0.95. This is supported by the title 'Beginners Gentle Pilates Flow Mat Workout' and tags such as 'pilates', 'gentle pilates workout at home', 'pilates for beginners', and 'pilates flow workout', indicating a Pilates session designed for beginners. The description further reinforces this with phrases like 'gentle Pilates Mat Workout for Beginners' and 'balancing your body and mind', typical of Pilates. Additionally, comments affirm the Pilates nature by mentioning how the instructions helped improve posture, a common goal in Pilates.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Mat' with a score of 0.75, as the workout involves mat-based exercises, evident from the title and tags including 'flow mat' and 'mat pilates for beginners'. Though Pilates exercises are primarily performed on a mat, the presence of specific references to 'mat' justifies this additional categorization. The combined emphasis on Pilates and mat work makes these the most suitable categories."
