  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit for this video is 'Soothing & Restorative', evidenced by the emphasis on easy morning stretches aimed at relieving back pain and promoting overall physical freedom and relaxation. Words used in the title and description like 'easy', 'morning', and 'back pain relief' suggest a gentle, healing-focused session. The channel's focus on helping individuals find inner peace through yoga further supports this classification. The high view count and positive user comments highlight the routine's accessibility for beginners, reinforcing its restorative nature.\n\nThe secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm', is moderately represented with a score of 0.6. This is inferred from the inherent nature of yoga, which typically involves smooth, coordinated movements. The comments mentioning doing the routine in different places suggest adaptability, a hallmark of 'Flow & Rhythm'. However, without strong evidence of music-driven or highly fluid sequences, the score remains moderate.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the video\u2019s low intensity and its emphasis on relaxation rather than precise, technical execution."
