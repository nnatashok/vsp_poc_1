  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as a 'Weight workout' due to explicit mentions of dumbbells and the detailed description of various exercises like chest press, shoulder press, and squats, all using weights. The consistent use of dumbbells throughout positions this workout strongly in the weight workout category, with a high score of 0.9. Additionally, the tags emphasize 'dumbbell workout' and 'muscle building', further supporting this classification. Although this workout is a full-body routine, it's specific about using weights rather than just bodyweight exercises, so 'Body weight' is included with a low presence score of 0.2, considering some exercises may minimally involve bodyweight components. Other categories were excluded as the workout does not focus on cardio, flexibility, or meditation-related activities, ensuring high confidence in the chosen categories."
