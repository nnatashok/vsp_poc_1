  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video \"10-Minute Core Workout For Lower Back Pain Relief\" is classified primarily under the \"Mat\" category with high confidence (score 0.8) because it features exercises that are performed on an exercise mat, such as planks, single leg bridges, and side plank hip lifts. The description also explicitly recommends an exercise mat, indicating floor-based exercises. \"Body weight\" is another suitable category with a score of 0.7, as the video emphasizes strengthening exercises using only body weight, like bird dogs and reverse crunches, to enhance core stability. The focus on core exercises for stabilizing the back and reducing pain further supports these categories. Other potential categories such as \"Stretching\" or \"Pilates\" were considered but excluded because the primary focus is on core strengthening rather than flexibility or controlled movements typical of Pilates."
