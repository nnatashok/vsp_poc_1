    "Love the no repeated workouts... They feel like they go by so much quicker and I&#39;m more motivated to workout more!",
    "It\u2019s crazy how effective all these home workouts are with only body weight. I see a difference so fast and can tell I\u2019m gaining muscle. I still go to the gym but honestly it can\u2019t compete",
    "I love how flexible she makes her workouts... There&#39;s no pressure and she always gives easier options to make your exercise more enjoyable for you. She let&#39;s you know it&#39;s ok to be slow, new and inexperienced. For Maddie, it&#39;s not just about showing you the workouts, it&#39;s about encouraging and motivating you all the way... I&#39;m grateful to have stumbled upon your videos \u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f... Such a lovely coach... Much love from \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec",
    "Yes, I\u2019m a beginner and this will be beneficial for me considering I\u2019m new to fitness. So pumped to do this!!!",
    "I\u2019m basically a beginner again after taking a months long hiatus from working out\ud83d\ude05 &amp; this was a good way to get started again\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe"
