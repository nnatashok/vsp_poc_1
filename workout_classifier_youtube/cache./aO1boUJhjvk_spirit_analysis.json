  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout exhibits a clear 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as indicated by the title emphasizing 'FULL BODY STRETCH For Rest Day, Improve Mobility & Flexibility'. The description further mentions 'Recover on your rest day', highlighting recovery and relaxation. The term 'recharged' reinforces a focus on restoration. The tags and description repeatedly mention 'rest day' and 'mobility', solidifying this classification. The user comments about feeling refreshed and relieved also support this spirit, and the scoring at 1.0 reflects an almost perfect embodiment of this spirit. A 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is present moderately (0.6), suggested by the 50-sec stretch intervals with 10-sec transitions, and comments about auditory cues and smooth song choices indicate a gentle, rhythmic progression. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to their mismatch with the session's restorative and flexible nature, focused on slower pacing and relaxation."
