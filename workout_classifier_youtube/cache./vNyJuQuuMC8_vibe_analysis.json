  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this video is 'The Zen Flow' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is due to the title and description which emphasize a \"beginner\" yoga session focusing on foundational elements, breath work, and meditation. The goal is clearly to provide a grounding, intentional practice that is breath-centered and unhurried, aligning perfectly with characteristics of 'The Zen Flow.' The inclusion of phrases like \"meditative pace\" and focus on \"form and function\" supports this classification. \n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Reboot Workout' with a score of 0.7. This is suggested by the description's emphasis on a \"sustainable and beneficial practice\" that includes stretching and movement to increase flexibility and regulate the nervous system, offering a refreshing, low-stress experience. The nature of an accessible beginner yoga session also aligns with a total-body refresh typical of 'The Reboot Workout.'\n\nThe channel's focus on inclusivity and the comment feedback about the session being gentle and transformative for one's mental and physical health further reinforces these vibes."
