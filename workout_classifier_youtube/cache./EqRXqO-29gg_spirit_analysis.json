  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'High-Energy & Intense,' with a very high confidence score of 0.95. The title explicitly mentions 'EXTREME FAT BURNING HIIT CARDIO WORKOUT,' indicating a fast-paced, vigorous session aimed at burning fat rapidly, which is characteristic of high intensity workouts. The description reinforces this with phrases like 'MELT SOME EXTREME FAT' and 'NO BREAK WORKOUT,' emphasizing continual effort and maximum exertion. Comments from users describe the session as challenging yet rewarding, with mentions of perceived intensity and effort.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a score of 0.6. This is inferred from the smooth transition likely required during a 5-minute workout with no equipment, as well as the use of bodyweight exercises that naturally flow in sequence. However, due to the focus on intensity, 'Flow & Rhythm' is evident but less dominant.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were considered but found irrelevant due to the lack of emphasis on precision, methodical progression, or relaxation."
