  "vibesExplanation": "The workout primarily aligns with 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its intense, short-duration focus, as described by '10 Minute HIIT Express,' indicating an explosive and high-effort session, especially with pyramid style sprints ('Interval 1: All Out Sprint \u2013 15 seconds'). The urgency and max effort described in the title and description suggest a quick, powerful workout fitting this vibe (score: 0.8).\n\nThe 'Endorphin Wave' is also relevant because the workout has a steady build-up in intervals with short, high-energy bursts, as shown in the described pyramid intervals, creating an elevated and feel-good endorphin release experience, especially noted through consistent user enjoyment ('Great workout! I like to increase the intensity with each interval!'). Thus, scoring a 0.7 for noticeable but secondary elements.\n\n'Warrior Workout' is a more general match due to the 'all-out sprint' phrasing and the description of pushing the body to the max, typical of primal energy and sweat-dripping sessions, but it's less emphasized here, rating a score of 0.6."
