  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Full Body Mobility Stretches' is primarily characterized by the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, scoring a 0.95. This is reflected in the title and description, which emphasize mobility, stretching, and muscle tension relief, indicating a focus on recovery and relaxation. The repeated mention of 'joint mobility' and 'muscle tension relief' supports this classification, suggesting a gentle approach aimed at healing and restoration. \n\nAdditionally, there is a 'Structured & Disciplined' element present, scoring a 0.65. The association with the NYU Steinhardt Department of Physical Therapy and the involvement of a trained physical therapist, Dr. Daniel Giordano, highlights a methodical, evidence-based approach typical of structured exercise programs. The educational context and reference to evidence-based practices suggest a systematic execution of the stretches.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the lack of intensity or sports-specific indicators in the metadata. Similarly, 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Flow & Rhythm' are not applicable given the focus on therapeutic stretching rather than rhythmic or environmental engagement."
