  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Yoga,' with a score of 1.0. The title explicitly mentions 'Yoga,' and the channel is 'Yoga With Adriene,' which specializes in yoga practices. The tags and description repeatedly reference yoga, indicating that this is the central focus of the video. Specific mentions of 'yoga for hips,' 'yoga for lower back,' and 'yoga for flexibility' in the tags further support this classification.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Stretching,' with a score of 0.55. The focus on releasing tension in the hips and lower back in both the title and multiple tags (such as 'yoga for lower back pain' and 'yoga for hip pain') suggests that stretching is a significant component of the workout, as yoga often includes stretching exercises aimed at improving flexibility and relieving tension.\n\nOther categories, such as 'Pilates' and 'Mat,' were considered but excluded due to the explicit focus on yoga rather than general floor exercises or core-centric workouts."
