  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout seems to embody the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit predominantly with a score of 0.7. Evidence for this classification includes the focus on 'tone and strengthen' with smooth, continuous Pilates movements, as highlighted in both the video's title and description. The word 'flow' in \"radiate an incredible glow from the inside out\" suggests a seamless integration of physical and mental components, typical of the 'Flow & Rhythm' workout spirit. \n\nThe workout also has characteristics of 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.6. This is supported by the precise targeting of muscles such as 'hamstrings, core, obliques, shoulders, arms, glutes,' which implies a detailed and systematic approach to fitness. \n\nI did not assign 'High-Energy & Intense' since the Pilates approach generally emphasizes control over rapid movements, and the tone of the video is more centered around mindful, engaged movement rather than intense, heart-pumping activity. Similarly, 'Soothing & Restorative' was not applicable due to the focus on toning and strengthening rather than relaxation or recovery."
