  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is explicitly described as requiring \"No Equipment,\" evident from the title and several occurrences of the phrase \"noequipment\" among the tags. The description reinforces this by mentioning the workout is an \"All Standing HIIT Session,\" which typically involves bodyweight exercises that do not require additional equipment. Additionally, user comments discuss the intensity and personal fitness trackers without mentioning any equipment, suggesting it was not used. Given the consistent messaging throughout the metadata, there is very high confidence (0.9-1.0) that this workout is designed to be performed without any equipment, focusing solely on bodyweight exercises."
