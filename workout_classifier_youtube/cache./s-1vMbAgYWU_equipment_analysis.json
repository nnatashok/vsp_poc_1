  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for this yoga video makes it clear that no props are required to perform the workout effectively. Both the title and tags suggest a focus on flexibility and a \"feel good flow,\" which typically does not heavily rely on specialized equipment. Crucially, the description explicitly states \"No props are required,\" indicating that this is a bodyweight workout that utilizes only the body's natural resistance. Additionally, the tags include 'yoga without props' and 'no props,' reinforcing the notion that the session requires no additional equipment beyond perhaps a mat, which is standard for comfort but not explicitly required as per the metadata. Therefore, no equipment from the provided options list is needed for this workout."
