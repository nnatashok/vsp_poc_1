  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video \"Full Body Guided Workout | Session 1\" primarily fits 'The Meditative Grind' and 'The Progression Quest' vibes. Indicators for 'The Meditative Grind' include the guided nature of the workout with form tips and a calming, motivational coaching style that allows participants to zone into the exercises, as noted in the top comments and descriptions. Given the workout's focus on incremental improvement across a series, it also aligns with 'The Progression Quest,' as it involves a structured 12-class program aimed at gradual enhancement of fitness, strength, and body sculpting over a defined period (six weeks). The mention of \"technique and form cues\" supports the inclusion of 'The Masterclass Workout,' focusing on skill-building elements. This is further inferred from the channel's emphasis on scientifically-backed workout methods. The descriptions and tags lacked the intensity or explosiveness to fit more high-energy vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter.' The confidence in the vibes classification is high due to explicit descriptors like \"calm energy,\" \"form tips,\" and structured progression."
