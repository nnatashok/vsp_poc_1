    "I just want to say thank you so much. I followed your channel throughout my pregnancy. I gave birth natural with no tears at 38weeks and 6 days. GOD BLESS YOU AND ALL THE MOM&#39;S. I cannot stop recommending this channel enough. If you want me to do a testimonial or anything I will be more than happy.",
    "I would love a 30-40 minute one like this! Loved it. A huge gym goer and happy to have found a way to still move in a similar way while becoming a mom!",
    "29wks pregnant and today was the first time since becoming pregnant that I\u2019ve felt like exercising. So glad to have found your channel!",
    "Jessica, I don&#39;t know if you are conscious enough of how important is what you are doing. Having a free access to all your content saves my life! I have been following your videos since my first pregnancy and postpartum and now again in my 2nd pregnancy and I love it. Just a little bit every day, it makes such a difference. Thank you so much, I keep on recommending your channel to all the mom&#39;s whatsapp groups! &lt;3",
    "Thank you! I have been so nauseous, and it&#39;s hard for me to work out at the gym now. I am glad I found something I can do from home!"
