    "Less talk\u2026 more action. Love it. Thanks.",
    "Just watched ur video. I&#39;m stunned. We&#39;ve had an airdyne-older model for about ten years. I&#39;m just now getting serious about my health n really was blowing off how much benefit it can produce. Obviously you&#39;ve put me in my place. You were dripping in sweat! I&#39;ll be rethinking how I work out. Thanks so much! \ud83d\ude01",
    "Awesome. Never realized the Airdyne bike was so versatile. Will definitely give these suggestions a try.",
    "LOOLLLL if I tried <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyhTm-7_bGU&amp;t=187\">3:07</a> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyhTm-7_bGU&amp;t=193\">3:13</a>  (or most of these, for that matter) at my gym I don&#39;t think they&#39;d let me back on the equipment...",
    "Disregarding the standing options this is pretty creative. Certainly takes the boredom out of this piece of equipment. Appreciated! Getting ready to purchase an Airdyne Pro."
