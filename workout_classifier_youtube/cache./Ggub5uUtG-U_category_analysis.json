  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary classification for this workout is 'Treadmill', as explicitly indicated by the title and description. The title '20 Min Interval Treadmill Workout' clearly positions this workout for a treadmill, while the description further elaborates on the treadmill-based activities with multiple paces\u2014'jog', 'run', and 'sprint'. The tags also include 'Treadmill', affirming its central role. This category was scored 1.0 because the treadmill is the primary equipment used, as noted throughout the metadata.\n\nThe secondary classification is 'HIIT', with a score of 0.8. The workout features 'interval' training with varying intensities (jog, run, sprint), which is characteristic of High-Intensity Interval Training. The title describes the workout as 'HIIT Run', and both the description and tags reference the interval nature and intensity, such as 'all out sprint', aligning with HIIT principles. Despite the strong presence of HIIT elements, it is not the exclusive focus, hence the score is slightly lower than that for 'Treadmill'.\n\nOther potential categories like 'Running' were considered but excluded, as the focus is clearly on treadmill use and specific HIIT style rather than general running."
