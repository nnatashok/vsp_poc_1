  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Stretching,' with a high confidence score of 0.9. The title and description explicitly mention 'flexibility routine' and 'full body flexibility routine,' which are strong indicators that stretching exercises are the main focus. The tags also include several related to stretching, such as 'stretching,' 'flexibility routine,' and 'beginner flexibility routine.'\n\n'Yoga' is also a relevant category with a moderate score of 0.6, reflecting its secondary presence. Tags like 'yoga,' 'yoga follow along,' and 'flexibility follow along' suggest some yoga elements might be integrated, offering a holistic approach to flexibility and calmness, as noted in user comments. However, the absence of specific yoga postures or practices in the description lowers its score.\n\n'Mat' was considered with a lower score of 0.4 because, though primarily a stretching workout, activities described might take place on a mat and generally imply simple, bodyweight-based floor exercises, as indicated by the general nature of 'beginner stretches.' Other categories such as 'Pilates' were excluded due to the lack of specific terminology or techniques typical to Pilates in the metadata."
