    "I&#39;m a 71 year old guy who started with HIIT back in February. My body has changed like I couldn&#39;t believe, having used traditional power lifting techniques I learned 40 years ago up to that point. This routine in particular helps alleviate a lot of my upper back pain. I use lots of your videos, particularly your full body routines. Keep up the excellent work. You totally deserve your 7.46 million subscribers!",
    "I cried while doing this :( I feel like this will be a very important part of my healing journey. Thank you so much",
    "i think Maddie is a psychic, this is the precisely what i need right now \ud83d\ude42",
    "I&#39;m beyond grateful I discovered this channel three years ago. This woman is just incredible. I LOVE her workouts, her dance parties and these stretch routines. I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say they have changed my life. Because of them I&#39;ve become really fit &amp; so flexible I&#39;m even able to do the splits. Also, I&#39;ve learned how to eat intuitively without having to restrict certain foods which was a milestone for me as I had been struggling with under-eating and over-exercising since I was 13. Maddie is such a healthy influence in this whole fitness industry. Can&#39;t even put into words how thankful I am for her.",
    "I went back to university last week and my body is so sour from sitting for so long in class and then on the bus so this is so needed!! Thank you!"
