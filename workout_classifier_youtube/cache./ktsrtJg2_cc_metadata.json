    "\ud83d\ude22 another winner! Since I found you, I have been following many of your terrific videos.<br>As you advise, I have been consistent. I have been following your high blood pressure videos, which are wonderful. I am 84 years young, and can do everything to keep up with you.<br>You are very beautiful, within, as well as on the outside. I am very grateful .<br>Blessings to you, and your family.",
    "I love this video",
    "I want you to know that your exercise videos have made a solid difference in my life.  As I age, I need to modify exercises but still incorporate cardio, strength, and stretching into my daily routines.  I appreciate this morning mobility workout because it is all standing and effective.  Since I travel extensively, I don&#39;t enjoy getting down on hotel room floors and you have many effective videos that do not require floor work.  However, all your videos are great when I am at home.  Thank you and appreciate your content.",
    "Loved good morning."
