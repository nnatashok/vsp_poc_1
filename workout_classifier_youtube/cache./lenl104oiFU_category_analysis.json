  "categoriesExplanation": "The video 'Workout To Lower Your Blood Pressure Permanently \u2013 10 Minutes Per Day' primarily involves a series of low-impact exercises performed on the floor, which aligns with the 'Mat' category. The description emphasizes 'dynamic exercises' that can be safely done multiple times a day, suggesting a combination of moves that don't rely heavily on external equipment, supporting the 'Mat' classification. The focus on blood pressure management through a workout that can be split into sessions implies a low-impact, steady-paced session rather than high intensity, further indicating a mat-based routine rather than hi-intensity workouts like HIIT or aerobic-based categories. Additionally, the mention of feeling better and improving health could imply relaxation and some mild flexibility elements, hence the mild presence of 'Stretching'. However, the lack of specific stretching-focused language keeps its score lower. Exclusions were made for categories like 'Yoga', 'Pilates', and 'Walking', as these are not explicitly mentioned or sufficiently implied in the description or title."
