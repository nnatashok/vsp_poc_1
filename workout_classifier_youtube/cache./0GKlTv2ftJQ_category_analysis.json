  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is categorized primarily as a 'Treadmill' workout due to repeated references to a manual treadmill in both the title and description (e.g., '15 Min Manual Treadmill Interval Workout for Beginners'). The description further outlines a structured workout using resistance settings on a manual treadmill, which justifies a high confidence score of 0.9 for the 'Treadmill' category. \n\nThe 'HIIT' category is also relevant, with a score of 0.6, as the workout includes interval training elements that are characteristic of high-intensity interval training (e.g., 'Interval Set 1: Resistance 2 \u2013 30 sec', and references to interval training in tags like 'manual treadmill hiit'). \n\nThe 'Walking' category was included with a score of 0.5 because the description suggests a walking workout with adjustable resistance on the treadmill, particularly highlighted in the warm-up ('Warmup: Easy Walk Resistance 1 \u2013 2 mins') and consistent identification of this as a walking type of exercise albeit on a treadmill, making it a specialized walking workout. \n\nThe channel's focus on fitness equipment and the video tags, including 'manual treadmill walking workout', reinforce these categorizations. Comments from viewers further support the intensity and treadmill-interval aspect of the workout."
