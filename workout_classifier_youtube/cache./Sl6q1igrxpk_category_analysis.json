  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is best categorized under \"Stretching\" with very high confidence due to the frequent use of terms like \"full body stretching,\" \"mobility routine,\" \"improve flexibility,\" and \"stretching exercises\" both in the title and throughout the metadata. All tags prominently feature stretching-related terms, and both the title and description focus on improving flexibility and mobility. This is also echoed in the high-frequency views and user engagement comments praising the stretching content. Given the detailed emphasis on stretching routines and the purpose clearly defined as stretching to improve flexibility, the \"Stretching\" category receives a score of 1.0.\n\n\"Yoga\" was considered due to some overlap in mobility-focused exercises typical in yoga, and the channel's description listing yoga; however, since the video does not appear to explicitly feature yoga sequences or terms in the metadata, this category is only marginally relevant and thus receives a low score of 0.3.\n\nOther potential categories like \"Pilates\" or \"Mat\" were excluded, as there was no mention of Pilates techniques or general mat exercises beyond stretching."
