  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe assigned is 'The Deep Recharge,' with a perfect score of 1.0. This is because the video is a guided meditation focused on 'letting go' and releasing mental and emotional burdens. The description emphasizes spiritual surrender, peace, and harmony, indicating an ultra-gentle approach designed to reset the nervous system. The strong emphasis on emotional healing, as evidenced by the top comments about overcoming heartbreak and finding inner calm, supports this classification.\n\n'Zen Flow' is also a relevant vibe, scoring 0.7. The description focuses on connecting with true selves and the universe, which aligns with grounding, intentional, and breath-centered qualities of a 'Zen Flow.' This score reflects the structured and mindful approach to meditation seen in the content.\n\nLastly, 'The Reboot Workout' is considered with a score of 0.5 due to the focus on total-body refreshment and releasing what no longer serves the viewer. However, this vibe is secondary, as the primary goal is emotional and mental release rather than physical stretching or mobility."
