  "vibesExplanation": "The video is strategically designed for absolute beginners focusing on basic bodyweight exercises without the use of weights or high-impact movements, as emphasized in the title and description. 'The Foundation Builder' vibe is highly appropriate here due to the focus on strength and form, targeting every major muscle group while ensuring proper execution to build foundational fitness skills. This is reinforced by the beginner-friendly approach and the inclusion of guidance on correct form, as noted in the description and user comments.\n\n'Comfort Moves' is also a relevant vibe, given the low-impact nature (\"no jumping\") of the workout and its emphasis on safety and accessibility for beginners, aligning with comments from users who are restarting their fitness journeys. The consistent theme of achievable exercise and gradual progression indicates this vibe.\n\nLastly, 'The Reboot Workout' vibe is partially applicable due to the focus on basic movements and revitalizing one's fitness after periods of inactivity, reflecting comments from users experiencing emotional release and motivation upon completing the workout. The choice of exercise and structure promotes a reset for the body, although this vibe is less dominant than the former two."
