  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is classified under two primary spirits: 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Flow & Rhythm'. The 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is evident due to the focused use of terms such as 'kick some butt', 'motivating', 'energizing', and specific segments like 'JUMPS', 'SPEED', 'CLIMBS', and 'SPRINTS' listed in the description. User comments reinforce this with mentions of intense experiences and notable fitness progress. This aligns with a strong match score of 0.75. 'Flow & Rhythm' is also applicable as the class is set to hip hop music, a genre known for its rhythm and beat, and the class progression from warm-up to cooldown suggests a fluid transition between exercises. This connection results in a score of 0.65. The structured format of the class could hint at 'Structured & Disciplined', but the focus on music and intensity lessens its relevance."
