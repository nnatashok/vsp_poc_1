  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"Guided Meditation Before Sleep: Let Go of the Day\" by Scott Ste Marie is a meditation session aimed at relaxation and emotional well-being, especially before sleep. The title, description, and tags provide clear indications that this is a guided meditation video. There is no mention of any physical workout, exercises, or equipment needed. Meditation typically requires no physical equipment unless specified, such as a mat for comfort, but the metadata does not suggest any specific needs. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that no equipment is required, and this session is designed for bodyweight only, focusing on mental and emotional relaxation."
