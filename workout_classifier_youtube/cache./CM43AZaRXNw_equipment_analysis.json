  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"20 min Morning Yoga Workout - Strength & Energy Yoga Flow\" explicitly states in both the title and description that this is a yoga session, which typically involves minimal equipment. More importantly, the description and tags emphasize that 'no props' are needed. Phrases such as \"no props needed\" and \"no props required\" in the description indicate that this yoga session is designed to be performed without any additional equipment, which aligns with the tag \"yoga without props\". Therefore, the workout appears to be designed to be bodyweight only, suitable for individuals looking to engage in yoga without the need for items such as mats, blocks, or other traditional yoga accessories. The presence of tags like \"no props\" further supports this interpretation. Thus, there is a very high confidence that no equipment is needed for this workout."
