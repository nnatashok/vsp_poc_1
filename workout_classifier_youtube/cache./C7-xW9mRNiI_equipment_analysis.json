  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"20-Minute Bodyweight Workout for Beginners (No Repeats)\" prominently mentions that it is a bodyweight workout with no equipment needed. The tags and description consistently highlight this aspect, using phrases like \"bodyweight workout,\" \"no equipment workout,\" and explicitly stating \"EQUIPMENT: No Equipment\" in the description. The workout involves exercises that typically do not require equipment, such as squats, lunges, push-ups, and core exercises. Though a mat is mentioned as the instructor uses an oversized yoga mat, it is not necessary for performing the exercises, which are suggested to be completed without any equipment. Therefore, I conclude that this workout is designed to be performed with bodyweight exercises only, requiring no equipment."
