  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Indoor biking' with a score of 1.0, due to explicit mentions in the title, description, and tags such as \"15 Minute Indoor Cycling Workout,\" \"indoor cycling,\" \"spin workout,\" and references to gym bikes. These details indicate a workout focused on stationary cycling, which fits perfectly into the Indoor biking category.\n\nThe secondary category is 'HIIT' with a score of 0.9, as the workout involves intense interval training. This is evidenced by repeated mentions of \"intense interval blast,\" \"intervals,\" \"sprints,\" and \"interval training.\" The description further supports this with structured interval timings and varying intensities, indicative of a high-intensity interval format. The consistent emphasis on pushing limits with sprints implies a strong alignment with HIIT principles.\n\nThe confidence in these classifications is very high (1.0) due to clear, specific language in the meta descriptions and the channel's known specialization in cycling and HIIT content."
