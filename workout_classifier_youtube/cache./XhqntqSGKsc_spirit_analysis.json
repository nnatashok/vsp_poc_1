  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's primary spirit is 'Soothing & Restorative,' due to explicit focus on creating a safe and gentle exercise routine suitable for pregnant women across all trimesters. The title, description, and tags emphasize safety and comfort, traits aligned with 'Soothing & Restorative' workouts. The high engagement in comments highlights participants' feelings of having a meaningful, uplifting experience during this transitional period, confirming the spirit's strong presence. The score of 0.9 reflects the very high confidence in this categorization. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also present, inferred from descriptions of smooth, continuous movement and the channel's tendency to offer coordination-focused content like yoga and Pilates. Although this is not a central theme, the presence of coordinated movements during pregnancy-focused workouts justifies a secondary score of 0.7. The channel and video create a supportive environment with safe, structured routines, yet 'Structured & Disciplined' was not dominant due to the flexible nature of pregnancy routines highlighted compared to strictly regimented exercises."
