  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a 20-minute guided run described explicitly as 'beginner friendly' in both the title and the description. Running, especially a short duration guided run, involves simple, repetitive movements with no complex choreography or significant coordination challenges. As such, it falls squarely into the 'Beginner' category for technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 20 minutes long and described as a 'beginner friendly' run, indicating a relatively manageable level of energy expenditure suitable for those new to fitness. It primarily qualifies as 'Light' effort difficulty due to its beginner orientation and relatively short duration. However, running can still be somewhat challenging for complete beginners, layering in a 'Moderate' effort classification with a lower score, as perceived difficulty can vary based on individual fitness levels.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The guided run is specifically described as 'beginner friendly,' strongly aligning with a 'Beginner' required fitness level. Since the workout duration is 20 minutes, it may also challenge those completely new to exercise, justifying an 'Intermediate' classification for those with minimal running experience who might find maintaining a jog for this time challenging. The opportunity to perform the run on a treadmill or outdoors and the encouragement to pace oneself allows for a broader range of fitness levels to participate."
