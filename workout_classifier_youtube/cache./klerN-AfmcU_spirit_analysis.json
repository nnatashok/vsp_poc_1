  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is best classified under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to the focus on calorie burning and high-intensity intervals, as indicated by terms like 'calorie-burn,' 'intense,' and 'HIIT.' The repeated use of 'high resistance' and references to 'interval' workouts in the description and tags reinforce this classification, reflecting a vigorous and challenging session. A score of 0.8 is appropriate, reflecting the strong alignment with this spirit. \n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also applicable here, considering the workout follows a clear structure with warm-up, interval rounds, and cool-down segments, as explicitly detailed in the description. The workout's progression through different resistance levels shows a disciplined training approach, earning it a score of 0.7 as a solid fit for this spirit.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the high intensity and structured nature, which are contrary to flowing, rhythmic movements or a gentle, restorative focus."
