  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit assigned to this video is 'Soothing & Restorative,' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is due to the video's focus on breathwork aimed at releasing emotional blockages, promoting relaxation, and providing clarity. The description emphasizes stress reduction and emotional well-being, which are core aspects of the Soothing & Restorative spirit. Tags such as 'anxietyrelief,' 'calmmind,' and 'stressfree' further support this classification.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a moderate score of 0.6. The channel description mentions that the exercises are infused with 'rhythmic music,' indicating a connection between movement (or breathing in this case) and musical flow. The video aims to create a seamless mind-body connection, which is a hallmark of the Flow & Rhythm spirit.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the lack of intensity and athletic focus in the content. The content is more introspective and gentle rather than energetic or sport-specific."
