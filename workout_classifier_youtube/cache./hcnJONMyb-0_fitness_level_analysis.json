  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout comprises basic calisthenics movements such as elevated and knee push-ups, negative dips, body rows, squats, and plank holds. These exercises are straightforward and require minimal coordination, making them suitable for beginners. However, negative pull-ups and body rows may require some understanding of body tension and stabilization, slightly increasing the complexity for very deconditioned individuals. Hence, the technique difficulty is primarily beginner with some elements touching intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes a series of exercises repeated 3 to 4 times with no rest between exercises and 2-3 minutes rest between rounds, making it moderately demanding. The combination of exercises engages multiple muscle groups with bodyweight exercises, leading to moderate effort difficulty. For individuals new to exercise, repeating the circuit multiple times without equipment can be somewhat challenging, hence reflecting a challenging effort level as well.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is explicitly labeled for beginners, featuring basic calisthenics exercises that require minimal technical skill and can be performed by those new to exercise. The repetition of exercises over several sets increases the effort requirement, making the workout suitable for those slightly beyond novice level as well. Intermediate fitness levels are included due to the volume and intensity that can be achieved by repeating sets, while only a mild touch of advancement is included to accommodate more frequent exercisers seeking a foundational routine. Given its beginner focus and potential adjustability in exercise intensity, this workout ranges from beginner to intermediate, with minor components potentially challenging advanced beginners."
