  "spiritsExplanation": "The video titled 'Calisthenics for Complete Beginners (Tips, Exercise Form, Programming)' strongly aligns with the \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit due to its focus on teaching calisthenics with an emphasis on form, programming, and progression. This is evident from descriptors in the title and description, such as 'Tips,' 'Exercise Form,' and 'Programming,' as well as tags like 'beginner workout' and 'bodyweight training.' The structured approach is further supported by timestamps indicating a clear progression from warmup to specific exercises (push, pull, core, legs), programming advice, and the importance of rest\u2014typical elements of a disciplined routine. \n\nThe secondary spirit, \"Sport & Agility,\" is selected with moderate confidence (0.6) due to the athletic foundation of calisthenics, which focuses on bodyweight strength and skills, noted in comments praising the video for improving personal fitness and for being life-changing in terms of physical capability\u2014a key aspect of sport-focused workouts. However, the primary focus remains on structure rather than specific sports skills, hence the allocation of a more moderate score. Other spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Soothing & Restorative,' are not applicable as the video is not focused on high-intensity interval training or relaxation/recovery."
