  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'High-Energy & Intense' due to multiple indicators of HIIT and running involvement, which implies an elevated heart rate and vigorous effort. The tags \"hiit workout for beginners\" and \"full body hiit workout follow along\" suggest a high-intensity focus, while comments such as \"surprisingly great\" and \"how much sweat you can bring\" further emphasize the effort and intensity involved. Therefore, this spirit is given a score of 0.75, indicating a strong match.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also relevant here. The video includes \"run and recovery intervals,\" which indicates a structured approach to the workout. The description's mention of specific interventions like warm-up and cool-down segments supports this, suggesting a disciplined format catering to methodical improvement. Thus, this spirit receives a score of 0.7.\n\nOther spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Flow & Rhythm' are not applicable due to the focus on intensity and structure, rather than relaxation or continuous smooth movement."
