  "vibesExplanation": "The video 'Beginner Full Body Stretching Routine- Workout with Jordan' is categorized primarily as 'The Reboot Workout' with a score of 0.8. This is because the metadata explicitly mentions it as a full-body stretching routine suitable for beginners or for recovery after workouts, which corresponds to a low-stress workout aimed at total body refresh and flexibility improvement. Comments like 'I feel like 30 years old', and descriptions of utility for those who feel 'sore and stiff' further support this vibe as fitting a restorative session. \nAdditionally, 'The Comfort Moves' vibe scored 0.7 due to the beginner-friendly nature and the suggested use of a chair for stability, indicating a safe and comfortable workout experience designed for a wide age group and fitness levels, as evidenced by user comments from older viewers and the general description.\nOther vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Deep Recharge' were considered but excluded as the focus is more on general stretching than on intentional grounding or ultra-gentle movement."
