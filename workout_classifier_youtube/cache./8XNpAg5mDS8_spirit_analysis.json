  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative,' evident from the title, description, and tags emphasizing relaxation, stress relief, and gentle movement, such as 'No Talking,' 'for Relaxation,' 'gentle stretch routine,' and 'stress relief yoga.' The user comments reinforce this, expressing gratitude for the calming, non-verbal format during stressful times. This spirit was assigned a high score of 0.95 due to the strong and explicit indicators of a focus on relaxation and recovery.\n\nThe secondary spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' is present but less pronounced. The mention of 'relaxing music' and a structured 25-minute routine with audio cues implies a degree of continuous movement and coordination, earning a 0.55 score. However, the emphasis on flow is more subtle compared to the restorative aspects.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the clear absence of high-intensity or performance-oriented elements. Similarly, 'Outdoor & Adventure' doesn't apply, as the workout is home-centered."
