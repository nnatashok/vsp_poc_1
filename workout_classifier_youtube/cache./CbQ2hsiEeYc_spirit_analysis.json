  "spiritsExplanation": "The video titled '15 Min Gentle Yoga Flow Full Body Stretch to Release Tension' is classified primarily under 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Flow & Rhythm' workout spirits. The title highlights 'gentle' and 'release tension', suggesting a focus on relaxation and stress release, which are core elements of the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This is reinforced by the description terms 'gentle', 'not too challenging', and 'nurturing practice'. The score of 0.9 for this spirit reflects these strong indicators of a calming and tension-releasing session. Meanwhile, 'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant, as indicated by the mention of 'yoga flow' and repeated emphasis on flow in the channel description, denoting continuous, harmonious movement patterns. A score of 0.7 reflects these elements, albeit secondary to the restorative focus. Comments further affirm these spirits by mentioning how the session leaves participants feeling 'rested and restored' and appreciating the 'flow'. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the lack of relevant high-intensity or rigorous structure indicators."
