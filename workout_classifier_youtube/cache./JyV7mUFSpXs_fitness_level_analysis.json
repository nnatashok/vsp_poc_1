  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes straightforward exercises like bicep curls and hammer curls, which are common for muscle isolation and require minimal coordination, thus aligning with beginner technique difficulty. However, variations like 'Bicep Curl Negatives' and 'Double Reverse Curl' introduce slightly more complexity due to the focus on control and reverse positioning, which can elevate it slightly towards intermediate for some users.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is only 10 minutes long and uses lightweight dumbbells (5-30 lbs as suggested), indicating it is low in energy expenditure and intensity, suitable for users at a beginner level. The brief duration and lightweight nature suggest a 'Light' effort classification but can approach 'Moderate' for novices who may find the continuous muscle engagement moderately challenging.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the simple technique and low effort required, this workout is primarily suitable for beginners. The short duration and suggestions to use light weights make it accessible to those new to fitness. However, due to options for slightly more complex movements and the potential to adjust dumbbell weight and repetition tempo, it can also align with the early stages of intermediate users looking to establish a consistent bicep workout routine."
