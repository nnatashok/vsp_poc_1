    "4th day in a row of your calesthinics routines and my 56 yr old body feels so much better! Knees better, less pain, hips open, thoracic back injury feeling better, etc. Coming to you from Baltimore, MD. Thanks, mate!",
    "Hello from France ! Ive just discovered your channel few months ago and Ive really been enjoying your workouts. I like the fact that you don&#39;t talk too much during the workouts, it helps me focus more. You just give precise and useful instructions, which is rare in the youtube game. Thank you for posting such professionnal content :)",
    "Day 2 with us here. We appreciate your commitment and energy",
    "Day 2 done. Great to have straight forward advice with none of the hyper motivation pap",
