  "description": "Welcome to your 45 minute full body hiit workout! This workout is going to help you get stronger by using compound exercises for your upper and lower body muscles and we will also boost our metabolism with cardio intervals throughout the workout. This workout is perfect for all fitness levels and you only need a couple sets of dumbbells. \n\nGrab your January BREAKTHROUGH Program Calendar here: https://shop.royalchange.fit/products/breakthrough-january-2024-workout-stretch-calendar\n\nIn today\u2019s workout we will work for 45 seconds and rest for 15 seconds in a circuit of 2 exercises. We will complete each circuit 3 times total before moving on. Each circuit will target your upper and lower body muscles and also aim to get your heart rate up! The training variables we are aiming for this month are strength and improving your conditioning so make sure you\u2019re grabbing weights in the 75%-85% of your max weights range and push yourself to increase the intensity when you are performing a cardio exercise. The cardio exercises can be done on the ground for a low impact modification if you need that but try to push yourself however you perform these exercises. You\u2019ll get the most out of the workout by pushing yourself to your highest intensity in our working periods and breathing in your rests to be able to execute the next set!\n\nThe Exercises: \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Squat and side step\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Front raises alternating\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jackknives\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mountain Climbers\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Plank Hold\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Straight Arm pull over and bridge\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lateral Lunges with db switch\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DB anchored leg raises\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Db Toe taps\n10.
