  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is explicitly titled \"30 Minute Full Body Dumbbell Strength Workout [With Audio Cues]\", indicating that dumbbells are central to performing this workout. This is further reinforced by tags such as \"dumbbell workout\", \"dumbbell strength training\", and similar phrases, all pointing to the use of dumbbells. The description clearly states, \"All you need is a pair of dumbbells but we recommend challenging yourself with each movement by using multiple sets of weights if you have them.\" This solidifies the requirement of dumbbells with high confidence (1.0) as they are mentioned multiple times as essential equipment. No other equipment is mentioned or implied, suggesting that the workout focuses solely on strength training with dumbbells."
