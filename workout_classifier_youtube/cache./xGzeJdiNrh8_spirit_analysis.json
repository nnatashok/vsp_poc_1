  "spiritsExplanation": "The analysis of the video metadata points primarily to a 'Soothing & Restorative' workout spirit with high confidence due to several specific indicators. The title, 'Beginners Stretching Routine,' along with phrases in the description like 'gentle whole body stretching,' 'relieves muscle tension,' and 'pain free,' strongly suggest a focus on relaxation and recovery. The mention of 'deep breathing exercises to help you relax at home' and the tag 'relaxation' further amplify this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also relevant, albeit with less emphasis. The routine is described as 'Physio guided,' which suggests a methodical approach characteristic of structured workouts. The involvement of a physiotherapist and the clear protocol for the session reflect a disciplined style, as captured by the tag 'Physiotherapy.' However, the primary emphasis on relaxation supports giving the higher score to 'Soothing & Restorative.'\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit and others like 'Sport & Agility' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to the focus on gentle and low-intensity exercises appropriate for recovery, not athletic performance or intensity."
