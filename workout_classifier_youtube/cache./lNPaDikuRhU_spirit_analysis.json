  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily aligns with the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit due to the strong emphasis on gentle stretching, relaxation, and recovery. The title \"15 Minute Gentle Full Body Stretch\" and tags such as \"gentle stretch workout,\" \"gentle stretches,\" and \"gentle stretch routine\" highlight the calming and restorative nature of the session. The description further supports this by stating the workout aims to leave participants \"feeling relaxed, rejuvenated and more flexible in a safe and gentle way,\" which aligns closely with the core qualities of the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit. Additionally, channel comments praise the gentleness and care taken in instructing participants, emphasizing relaxation and comfort.\n\nThe \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit also fits, albeit to a lesser extent, due to the use of a specific routine over a set 15-minute period and Jessica Valant's background as a physical therapist and Pilates teacher, which suggests a methodical approach. However, this is not the predominant focus, leading to a moderate score for this spirit."
