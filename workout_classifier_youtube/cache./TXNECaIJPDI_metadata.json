    "I\u2019ve never done these or anything like this. I was having a horrible panic attack one night and just searched for breathing exercises for anxiety on YouTube. This was the one I clicked and now I come back to it several times a week. The whole \u201cimagine your lungs have a glow when you breathe in\u201d really resonates with me and I imagine it and breathe anytime I feel anxious now. This helps me more than anyone will ever know. My battle with debilitating anxiety that no ones knows about got a little easier after finding this.",
    "I am THANKFULL for these people who is doing videos like this. God and Angles Bless You \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude07",
    "Thank you. I was feeling so much anxiety this morning.  Started to feel a pain on my hips that I know eventually expands to the rest of my body. I texted a group of friends and one sent me this video. First time it made me cry more. Second time i felt more relaxed and sleepy by end of it. I went into your page and clicked on snother video and i felt numbness all over my body and mind. It relaxed me so so so much in less than 30 minutes. <br>Thank you thank you thank you!",
    "I always refer to this meditation whenever I feel awful and depressed. I am so glad I did. Earlier, I was having a breakdown and with terrible thoughts in my head so I just referred back to this meditation. It definitely helps me sleep before going about my day. Thank you so much for this.",
    "This was lovely. I like that there was no pressure to breathe in for X number of counts, hold, etc. but just to be mindful, aware, present, and steady. Thank you."
