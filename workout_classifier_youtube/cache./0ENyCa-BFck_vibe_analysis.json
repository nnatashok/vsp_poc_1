  "vibesExplanation": "The video strongly aligns with \"The Foundation Builder\" vibe due to its focus on foundational bodyweight exercises like pull-ups, push-ups, and dips targeted at beginners. This is explicitly noted in the title, tags, and description which emphasize 'calisthenics for beginners,' 'beginner calisthenics program,' and 'can't do pull-ups.' The instructional and foundational nature is evident as the video details progressions to help viewers strengthen from basic levels. This yields a high score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, the \"Progression Quest\" vibe is relevant as the video serves as a step-by-step guide to improving at calisthenics over time, suggested by phrases such as 'progressions for the most important bodyweight exercises' and 'how to get stronger at home,' indicating methodical progress. This receives a score of 0.7 given its strong focus on inciting physical improvement through structured methodical training, although the emphasis on foundational skills is even more pronounced.\n\nOther vibes such as \"The Masterclass Workout\" were excluded as the emphasis is not on advanced techniques or high-caliber skill-building but rather on basic entry-level development."
