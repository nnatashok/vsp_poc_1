  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily focused on improving mobility through stretching, as indicated explicitly by the title 'DAILY STRETCH', description mentioning 'mobility exercises', 'stretch routine', and tags such as 'stretching exercises', 'daily stretch routine'. The routines, such as 'World's Greatest Stretch', 'Cat Cow', and 'Asian Squat', demonstrate exercises aimed primarily at flexibility and range of motion. Therefore, 'Stretching' is assigned a high score of 0.9. Additionally, given there are some elements of mobility training that might not fit purely as 'Stretching' (e.g., 'mobility training' and 'flexibility routine'), an 'Other' category is also suggested with a moderate score of 0.5. This accounts for aspects of 'mobility training' that involve dynamic movements not strictly for flexibility. No evidence suggests alignment with other categories like 'Yoga' or 'Pilates', nor does it fit traditional exercise methods like 'Weight workout' or 'Body weight'."
