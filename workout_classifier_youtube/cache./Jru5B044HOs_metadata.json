    "I cannot begin to tell you how much this workout has helped me(36 M). I started about 4 months ago and at first I could barely get through it once but since then I&#39;ve started doing it every other day and I&#39;m up to 3X per workout, which takes 26 mins total. For starters I always had issues getting into a workout routine, I&#39;d ride my stationary here and there, shoot some hoops or do some rowing, which are all great but I could never find a good balance for a consistent full body workout. This circuit has given me structure, efficiency and, most importantly, results. When I started doing the workout I was hovering above 200 lb, I&#39;m now sitting below 180, a weight I haven&#39;t even sniffed since I was in my early 20&#39;s. I also had been struggling to squeeze into size 34 pants, but now size 32 is nearly falling off of me, which is also something I haven&#39;t experienced since my early 20s. If you&#39;re interested in the science behind this workout there is a Harvard study on high intensity circuit training (HICT) that is very interesting and is where this circuit originated. One interesting thing I learned from that study is that when you do HICT your metabolic rate is increased for up to 48-72 hours after working out. I&#39;d also like to mention that I DID NOT make changes to my diet, I think I&#39;m generally  a fairly healthy eater but I still indulge just as much as I used to, if not more now because I don&#39;t feel the guilt, I know I&#39;m burning it off even on my rest days. Thank you\ud83d\ude4fI highly recommend!!",
    "Hi! I&#39;ve been doing this exercise 4 rounds a day for 4 months. Along with proper diet, I lost 17 pounds and moved from being Obese Type I to having Normal BMI ^_^ Thank you!",
    "Here\u2019s the regimen, in case anyone else likes having it written down!:<br><br>Remember to keep moving during rest phases!<br>It\u2019s okay to modify these to make it easier for you. Just keep up the routine! The harder techniques will become easy if you keep building those muscles in any way that works best!<br><br>30sec Jumping jacks<br>10sec REST<br>30sec Wall sit/static squat<br>10sec REST<br>30sec Push ups<br>10sec REST<br>30sec Crunches (note: do NOT sit up all the way. sit ups aren\u2019t as beneficial as crunches the way she does them in the video)<br>10sec REST<br>30sec Step ups (chair, stair, etc)<br>10sec REST<br>30sec Squats<br>10sec REST<br>30sec Tricep dips (chair behind you, pull yourself up with those back muscles!)<br>10sec REST<br>30sec Plank<br>10sec REST<br>30sec High knees<br>10sec REST<br>30sec Lunges<br>10sec REST<br>30sec Push up + rotation<br>10sec REST<br>30sec Side plank - Side 1<br>10sec REST<br>30sec Side plank - Side 2<br>~ WORKOUT COMPLETE! ~<br>Keep at it! Make this routine just as ordinary as breakfast. This won\u2019t be difficult forever\u2014your muscles will build and learn to be efficient over time. I\u2019m trying to get back into shape, and I wish you just as much luck as I hope to have, myself. Go out there and gain that extra endurance, stranger!",
    "There&#39;s no many versions of this available, but I keep coming back to this one. I think it&#39;s Kelly&#39;s personality and presentation style. It feels like a good friend is talking me through it.",
    "Thanks for your video. It&#39;s very well put together, and so are you! I&#39;m 78 yrs old, and I&#39;m still able to do the exercises to a great extent."
