  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The 4-7-8 breathing technique is a simple pranayama exercise. Its core action involves inhaling, holding, and exhaling for specified counts, which are beginner-friendly movements as indicated by the terms 'simple breathing,' 'calm breathing exercise,' and the channel's emphasis on ease. However, achieving precise pacing control might require some practice, hence the 'Intermediate' score as well.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 1.0,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as 'Light' because breathing exercises are inherently low in energy expenditure, as reflected in calming terms like 'deep relaxation' and 'anxiety relief.' The mentioned potential slight lightheadedness for beginners due to increased oxygen is a minor physiological effect and does not imply any high exertion. Being a 15-minute practice aligns with a gentle classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner,' suitable for the target audience looking for simple relaxation techniques, as the practice is about calm breathing and meditation. 'Intermediate' is modestly scored due to potential initial challenges of proper paced breathing noted in comments, although the overall physical requirement is minimal. The offering of slower and faster versions indicates adaptability, supporting inclusion of the 'Intermediate' level."
