The description and comments suggest starting with exercises one can do, and working up as strength is gained, indicating a focus on straightforward movements. However, intermediate techniques could apply if variations or progressions like gym rings or more advanced bodyweight exercises are incorporated.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the beginner-centered focus and 26-minute duration, the workout is primarily suitable for beginners, who can start with basic exercises. Intermediate and advanced levels are included because users can progress to more challenging versions of exercises (e.g., full pushups or pullups), as indicated by user comments and descriptions of progressions. Thus, multiple levels are applicable, especially since users can modify intensity and resistance by changing exercise variations or adding progressions."
