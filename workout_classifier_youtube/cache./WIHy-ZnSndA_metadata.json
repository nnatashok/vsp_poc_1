    "People most likely will not see this. This video is rather old at this point. Using this video and changing my diet slightly. I lost 120 lbs over this past year. I will go on to upgrade myself to the longer workouts on Hasfit&#39;s channel. I love what you two have done for my life. I hope some person out there can read this commet and know that it is possible!",
    "i actually finished a weights workout? me with my noodle arms???? holy heck ive never been more proud of myself. thank you for this video!",
    "I&#39;ve been doing this video in my little apartment during covid lockdown and it&#39;s one of my favorites I&#39;ve come across so far. I&#39;m at the tail end of chemotherapy and trying to build my muscle back up. It&#39;s challenging but not to the points of being unable to complete it. Thank you for making this!",
    "My arms are burning and I love it.  I have lost 39 pounds over the last three months with diet and exercise.   This is a wonderful video... Who would give it a thumbs down???  Stay motivated......",
    "This is by far the most realistic beginner strength training video I\u2019ve ever seen. Finished it and feeling the burn."
