  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Meditation' with a high score (0.9) as the metadata heavily indicates that this is a guided meditation video. The title mentions 'Guided Meditation' explicitly, paired with terms such as 'Chakra Alignment' and 'Balance', aligning with common meditation themes of inner alignment and peace. The description further reinforces this by focusing on 'peaceful meditations' and offers a link for more meditation resources. Tags such as 'guided meditation', 'meditation for sleep', and 'chakra alignment' suggest the video\u2019s purpose is meditation focused.\n\nAdditionally, 'Breathing exercises' receives a moderate score (0.5) because the video, while not explicitly described as a breathing exercise session, frequently involves breathing as a relaxation and meditation technique, especially under the theme of chakra alignment and balance, which often incorporate breath work. \n\nOther potential categories like 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were excluded due to lack of emphasis on physical movement or postures, as the focus remains on mental peace and meditation."
