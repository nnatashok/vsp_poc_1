  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, due to the focus on doing 100 push-ups, which suggests an aerobic, high-intensity effort (as indicated by terms like 'insane results' and 'extreme workout' in the tags). This aligns with the fast-paced, challenging nature typically associated with high-energy workouts, warranting a score of 0.7.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also prominent, given the routine's procedural nature and repeated emphasis on building discipline and consistency (as supported by comments about repetition, progression, and the structured nature of the workout). The mention of 'step-by-step guided tutorials' in the description and users discussing progression paths (like starting with fewer reps and building up) further corroborates this spirit. Therefore, it was rated at 0.8.\n\nThe mode of exercise (push-ups) and detailed methodology explicitly confirm this spirit. Other spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the evident indoor, high-intensity focus of the workout."
