  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"Best Pregnancy Stretches | 15-Min Full-Body Daily Stretch Routine | Relieve Pregnancy Symptoms\" suggests a passive and floor-based routine typical for stretching and prenatal yoga, evidenced by tags such as \"prenatal yoga\" and \"pregnancy yoga.\" Such practices commonly require a mat to provide a comfortable, soft surface for poses and to prevent slipping, particularly for pregnant women who need added safety and comfort. The absence of any other specific equipment mention in the title, description, or tags, and the fact that comments and the description emphasize a gentle, accessibility-focused stretch routine, supports a high confidence in the need for a mat while indicating no other equipment is clearly necessary. Therefore, a mat is identified with high confidence (0.75) as potentially needed for the comfort and safety essential in prenatal stretch routines."
