  "categoriesExplanation": "The video title and description clearly indicate a focus on 'neck exercises' and 'neck stretches,' suggesting a primary category of Stretching. The tags further reinforce this with terms like 'neck stretches,' 'neck stretching exercises,' and 'Stretching (Character Power).' The specific exercises mentioned, such as 'Chin to chest stretch' and 'Ear to shoulder stretches,' are traditional stretching exercises targeting the neck and shoulder areas, which strongly supports the assignment of the Stretching category with a high score of 0.9. The prominence of 'Physical Therapist' and 'physio' tags suggest professional guidance, but the core activity remains stretching, not physical therapy per se. Some elements like posture correction overlap slightly with general exercises but are primarily part of stretching routines. Thus, the 'Other' category is included with a low score (0.1) to account for any peripheral activities, though the emphasis remains on stretching, as corroborated by the user comments highlighting relief from tension and improved flexibility through these routines."
