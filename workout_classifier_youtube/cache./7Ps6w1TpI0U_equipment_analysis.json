  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video explicitly states \"No Equipment\" in the title and the description reinforces this by stating it is an \"at-home and no-equipment workout.\" The comments, tags, and other metadata consistently refer to the workout as a Pilates session that is suitable for anywhere due to its lack of equipment requirements. Therefore, the analysis concludes with very high confidence that no equipment is needed for this workout, aligning with the descriptions and intent of bodyweight exercises characteristic of Pilates. This makes it a bodyweight-only workout, further supported by the channel's focus on accessible, equipment-free exercises."
