  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated between Beginner and Intermediate because the exercises are likely simple yet could involve basic to moderate coordination due to yoga's nature. The use of terms like 'seemingly simple practice' and the emphasis on stability and release suggest accessible poses that may still require attentive engagement, suitable for beginners and intermediates. The wide audience appeal and comments from users of all ages and backgrounds further support this classification, indicating both basic and somewhat complex elements might be present.",

  ],
  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty leans strongly towards 'Light' due to the focus on breath, stability, and release, suggesting a gentle flow intended for relaxation and pain relief rather than intense physical exertion. The duration of 23:20 is relatively short but long enough to lightly moderate effort for deconditioned users. Given the focus areas (hips and lower back) frequently target gentle rehabilitation and mindfulness, effort is primarily light, with some moderate elements likely in maintaining positions or transitions.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is strongly suitable for both Beginners and Intermediates due to the focus on simple yoga practices and accessibility for all levels, as evidenced by the inclusive language targeting all bodies and the supportive nature of the community testimonials. The combination of light to moderately challenging effort and techniques that require basic to moderate coordination supports this dual-level rating. Advanced fitness levels are unlikely required, but some users with improved body awareness may find depth in this practice, albeit at a lower intensity."
