    "Thank you for doing so many quiet workouts. I broke my pelvis four months ago and I can do most of your moves. I love being able to safely get my heart rate up! I used your sitting workout for the first few months of my recovery. You are awesome!",
    "This channel has some of the most engaging, fun, and &quot;feel good&quot; workouts! Never stop doing what you&#39;re doing!",
    "well this was my first ever workout with Jessica smith.  I do a lot of Ellen Barrett barefoot fusion workouts.  THis one I had sweat pouring off of me.  I thought I would not make it through.  But I did,  Look forward to doing more of her workouts.",
    "oh boy, i thought i was ready to move on to your moderate intensity workouts...made it about half way and am drenched. Guess I&#39;ll stick with the beginners for a while longer! Thanks!",
    "I paused the video for 30 seconds to caught breath and drink water every 12 minutes. I kept having to convince myself to keep going, but I did the whole thing and I feel good. I really needed a good sweat. I love that you have workouts for all fitness levels. Thank you for your hard work. You are so encouraging and realistic."
