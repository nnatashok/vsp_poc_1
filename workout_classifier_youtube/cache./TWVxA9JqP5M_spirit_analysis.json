  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this video is 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.9. This is supported by the description emphasizing 'burning way more calories' and the 'after-burn effect,' indicating a workout designed to maximize calorie burn through elevated heart rates and continuous exertion, characteristic of high-energy workouts. The mention of 'peripheral heart action training' which involves circuit-style training alternating between upper and lower body exercises, further emphasizes intensity. \n\nThe secondary spirit, 'Structured & Disciplined,' scores 0.8 due to the specific methodical approach described, including the use of circuit training with specific exercises (e.g., bench press, barbell squats) and the mention of 'building muscle to elevate resting metabolism.' This suggests a structured approach to modify weight training for fat loss, requiring discipline and protocol adherence.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded as the focus is on intensity and structure rather than continuous smooth motion or relaxation."
