  "categoriesExplanation": "This workout is classified as 'Calisthenics' with a high confidence score of 1.0 because the title and tags explicitly mention 'calisthenics workout' multiple times, including 'intermediate calisthenics,' 'calisthenics skills,' and 'calisthenics exercises.' The description further supports this by mentioning exercises aimed at improving strength and flexibility through 'pistol squats, press up progressions,' and various bodyweight exercises. The second category, 'Body weight,' is also relevant with a score of 0.7, as the workout focuses on using body weight for strength training, indicated by terms like 'bodyweight strength workout' and 'bodyweight training.' Although there's a mention of 'strength and mobility,' there's no specific equipment like weights signaled, which aligns with bodyweight training. No other categories fit as closely; for example, 'Weight workout' is not applicable due to the absence of equipment use."
