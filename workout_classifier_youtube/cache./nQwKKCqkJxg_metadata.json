    "Being a person with 120kg, I have started my diet and workout from this week. Doing this yoga in the morning helped me a lot to get comfortable with my body and I can do this without any difficulties. Yet, felt a lot of stretches in my body. Thank you so much for this beginner friendly yoga.",
    "I am 65 and completely out of shape. This is the first yoga class I\u2019ve been able to do all the way through. I can\u2019t tell you how thankful I am to you. I think I can continue this."
