  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves basic bodyweight exercises performed with a focus on 'time under tension,' implying slow and controlled movements, which enhance muscle engagement. The 'no repeat' format suggests a variety of simple exercises without complex routines, aligning mostly with beginner techniques. Intermediate techniques are somewhat represented because maintaining proper form with 'time under tension' requires attention and body awareness.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video length of approximately 25 minutes increases the effort required, especially for beginners. The workout is labeled as a 'full body strength workout' focused on 'time under tension,' which implies a sustained contraction and thus a moderate level of effort. User comments about raised heart rates suggest that there's a considerable challenge, but the lack of equipment keeps the intensity in the moderate range for most individuals. The possibility of adding weights further increases the potential difficulty, pushing the effort margin towards challenging for those who do so.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is described as suitable for beginners with the possibility for advanced users to increase difficulty by adding resistance. This inclusive approach suggests it caters to both beginners, who benefit from the simplicity and basic nature of exercises, and intermediates who enjoy a minority of more challenging, slow movements. With added weights, it also touches the edge of suitability for advanced fitness enthusiasts. Therefore, all three levels are included, with a strong emphasis on beginner and intermediate levels due to the workout's structure and descriptions."
