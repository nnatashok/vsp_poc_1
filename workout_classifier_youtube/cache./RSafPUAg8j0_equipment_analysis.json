  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video, titled \"PERFECT 5 MIN CHEST WORKOUT | REAL RESULTS,\" strongly implies a bodyweight-only routine. The use of \"calisthenics\" in the tags and the description's encouragement to follow Chris Heria for a chest workout suggests exercises that rely on body weight, such as push-ups, which are mentioned explicitly in the comments. No specific equipment is mentioned in the title or description, nor do any of the comments imply the necessity of equipment. The absence of tags or descriptions indicating equipment also supports the conclusion that this is a bodyweight-only workout. Therefore, no equipment is classified as needed for this workout."
