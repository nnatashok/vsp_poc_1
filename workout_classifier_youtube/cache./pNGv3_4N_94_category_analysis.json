  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as a weight workout due to the inclusion of dumbbells, as evident from the description which lists 'Dumbbells I use: https://amzn.to/3fajFM5'. This strongly indicates that the workout involves exercises with weights, thus supporting a high score of 0.9 for the 'Weight workout' category. Comments from viewers such as 'Just finished this one at 35 weeks with 13lbs dumbbells' and '5lb weights were still a great challenge here' further confirm the use of weights, bolstering the confidence level and score assigned.\n\nThe 'Mat' category is also moderately applicable with a score of 0.5, given the equipment specified includes a mat or soft surface ('Equipment needed: mat or soft surface'), indicating that exercises may be performed on a mat, possibly involving exercises that utilize body weight or are floor-based. This aligns with typical mat exercises, contributing to a moderate presence. However, since the primary focus is on strength with weights, the score is lower than for the weight workout.\n\nThere is no strong evidence of yoga, pilates, HIIT, or other specific categories; the focus is more on strength and prenatal suitability."
