  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The guided meditation is primarily about visualization and relaxation, requiring minimal physical technique or coordination. The words 'gentle' and 'calming' in the description suggest simplicity, which aligns with 'Beginner' level technique difficulty. Visualization techniques mentioned could potentially require some mental focus or practice, aligning with 'Intermediate' for those new to meditation, but still primarily beginner-friendly.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Meditation is a low-energy physical activity involving sitting quietly and focusing, which requires minimal energy expenditure. The description's emphasis on relaxation and letting go of stress indicates it's a low-intensity activity, well-suited for the 'Light' effort difficulty level. The 'best guided beginner meditation' tag further supports this classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The meditation requires minimal physical exertion and simple techniques, making it accessible for beginners. The inclusion of the tag 'meditation for all levels' and 'best guided beginner meditation' suggests it can be beneficial for beginners, while the mental discipline involved in visualization techniques may slightly challenge and thus interest intermediates. The 'Intermediate' level is included to account for potential initial challenges with maintaining focus, yet still very beginner-friendly."
