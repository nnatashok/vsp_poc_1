    "If you have anxiety thinking you can&#39;t breathe fully in, you feel like your chest is tight and possibly you&#39;re yawning a lot-<br>Learn the difference between chest breathing and diaphragmatic breathing, you want to be doing diaphragmatic breathing.<br>I was struggling with this for days at a time before I figured it out, focusing on my breath made me feel more anxious because I felt like I couldn&#39;t take a full breath, thought something was wrong with my lungs but it was all a mental thing, it&#39;s a form of hyperventilation.<br><br>Learn to use your stomach muscles to control your breath, it&#39;s effortless and how you breath when you&#39;re not paying attention to it, learn to do it consciously. I hope this helps someone \ud83d\udc9a",
