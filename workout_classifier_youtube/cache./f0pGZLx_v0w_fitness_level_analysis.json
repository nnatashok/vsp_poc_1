  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty of this workout is primarily beginner due to the simple nature of guided breathwork exercises. Breathing techniques generally do not require extensive physical coordination or complex movements, making them accessible to those new to exercise. Users can easily modify the intensity by adjusting breathing pace, as mentioned in the top comments. However, some users may find certain techniques slightly overwhelming, suggesting a mild alignment with intermediate level for those unfamiliar with breathwork specifics.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level for this workout is chiefly beginner due to the low physical demands and simplicity of the breathwork exercises. The description and comments suggest it is accessible to new practitioners, though some might find initial techniques slightly challenging, which suggests a modest alignment with intermediate. User comments indicate potential initial overwhelm for complete novices, marginally raising the need for some mental readiness, characteristic of intermediate users, but overall, it's highly accessible."
