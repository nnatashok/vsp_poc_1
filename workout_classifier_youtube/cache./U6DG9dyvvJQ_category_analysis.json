  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Calisthenics,' as evidenced by the repeated mention of 'calisthenics' throughout the video title, tags, and description. The program is specifically structured around a 3-day calisthenics routine, as indicated in both the title \"3 Day Calisthenics Workout Plan | FULL PROGRAM\" and the description that outlines calisthenics exercises for different skill levels. The video description provides timestamps and details about calisthenics exercises, including full-body, leg, and upper-body routines, confirming that calisthenics is the central focus.\n\nAdditionally, 'Body weight' is a relevant category with a score of 0.7, as the video involves exercises using bodyweight, which is a key aspect of calisthenics. This score reflects its strong presence but secondary importance compared to the calisthenics classification. The absence of equipment-based workouts, typical of calisthenics, and the tags like 'how to build muscle with your bodyweight' further support this classification. No other categories like 'Weight workout' are applicable as there is a clear emphasis on no-equipment, bodyweight exercises."
