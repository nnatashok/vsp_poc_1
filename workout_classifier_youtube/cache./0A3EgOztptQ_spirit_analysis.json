  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Structured & Disciplined' with a strong score of 0.8 due to its clear, methodical design, outlined in the description. It follows a proven protocol with specific sets, reps, and rest intervals (e.g., 3x8-12 reps with 60 seconds rest). The emphasis on 'good form' and 'maximum gains' further underscores this disciplined approach, aligning with the structured spirit. \n\nAdditionally, there is a secondary classification as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a moderate score of 0.6. This is supported by the video's emphasis on 'maximum gains,' and the full-body focus implies a demanding physical level, which can be intense, especially with exercises like lunges and presses.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to lack of emphasis on continuous movement, relaxation, or stress reduction cues. 'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are also not relevant as the workout is gym-based and not focused on athletic agility or nature-based activities."
