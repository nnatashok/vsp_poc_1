  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is classified as 'Beginner' with high confidence due to the simplicity of the movements involved in this workout. Manual treadmill walking primarily requires basic walking skills, which involve straightforward movements with minimal coordination. The video description emphasizes that the workout is appropriate for beginners, and the routine includes walking at various resistance levels, which does not demand advanced motor skills or complex patterns.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is primarily 'Light' due to the short duration of 14 minutes and the focus on walking intervals with recovery periods between sets. However, 'Moderate' effort is also relevant because the workout includes increases in resistance, which can slightly elevate energy expenditure. Comments indicate an increased heart rate ('feel the burn'), suggesting that it can be marginally challenging for deconditioned users. Overall, the intervals and resistance can elevate the workout from light to moderate, especially since it is conducted on a manual treadmill which requires more effort than an automatic treadmill.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level primarily includes 'Beginner,' as explicitly stated in the title and description, and reinforced by the short duration and basic walking technique. 'Intermediate' fitness level is also applicable because users need to manage intervals with varying resistance, which requires some stamina and control. A minor inclusion of 'Advanced' is due to the possibility of increasing resistance and pace, making the workout more challenging as noted in the description and viewer comments. The nature of manual treadmills requires more effort than motorized versions, which can make it somewhat demanding for absolute beginners, thus supporting a broader fitness level range."
