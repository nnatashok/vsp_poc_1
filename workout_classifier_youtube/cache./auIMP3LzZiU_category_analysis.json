  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified under the 'Pilates' category with high confidence due to multiple strong indicators in the metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'Full Body Pilates Workout,' and the description highlights that it's a Pilates session led by a Pilates teacher, Jessica Valant. Additionally, tags such as 'full body pilates workout,' '10 minute pilates workout,' and 'Pilates Workout full body' reinforce this classification. The comment praising the instructor's teaching style suggests typical Pilates workout characteristics, such as clarity in exercise explanation, which are usually associated with Pilates practices. Other categories like 'Cardio' or 'Yoga' were closely considered but not selected due to the clear emphasis on Pilates in both the title and tags. The score of 0.95 reflects the central focus on Pilates and the prevalent use of related terms across metadata."
