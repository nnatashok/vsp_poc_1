  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described in the title and tags, such as '20 Minute Spin Class Workout,' 'spin workout', and 'indoor cycling workout', indicating that it is an Indoor biking session, giving it a score of 1.0 as the central and defining characteristic of the workout. The description further reinforces this by mentioning 'this 20 minute spin class workout is a great fat burning indoor cycling routine,' and the need for a 'stationary or spinning bike.' Furthermore, the description of the workout as including 'intervals of high intensity spinning followed by periods of lower intensity indoor cycling' suggests characteristics of a HIIT workout, which involves alternating high and low intensity intervals, justifying a score of 0.8 for the HIIT category. The overall structure and remarks from the comments further corroborate the categorization, highlighting the alternating intensity and the format typical of a spin class."
