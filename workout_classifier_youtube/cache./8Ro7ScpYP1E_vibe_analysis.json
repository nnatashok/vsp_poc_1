  "vibesExplanation": "The video is best categorized as 'The Masterclass Workout' due to its focus on technique and strength-building commonly associated with Pilates, as highlighted by phrases like 'tone and strengthen' and 'build a solid foundation'. This fits the vibe with a score of 0.7 due to the explicit focus on strengthening various muscle groups technique-centered exercises. 'The Zen Flow' is also an appropriate vibe, scored at 0.65, because the holistic, mindful approach and inclusion of words like 'strong and centered', 'radiate an incredible glow' suggest a calm, breath-centered practice that's intentional and unhurried, which is essential for a Zen Flow workout. Additionally, 'The Foundation Builder' fits moderately well, scoring 0.6, since the description emphasizes building a 'solid foundation' of health and fitness which is a characteristic of workouts that aim to strengthen weak points and ensure a strong base. The presence of a scenic location (Barbados) and emphasis on 'authentic light' implies a mindful, foundational journey rather than an intense physical push. Potentially confusing tags like 'booty tone' suggest other vibes, but the overall emphasis on health and foundational strength leads to these choices."
