  "vibesExplanation": "The workout primarily features a HIIT structure that includes resistance and incline intervals, aligning partly with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe due to the heart-pumping nature of HIIT, warranting a score of 0.6. However, the use of a 'happy 70s pop soundtrack', with artists like Sister Sledge and Abba, strongly evokes 'The Nightclub Workout' vibe, characterized by upbeat music and a fun atmosphere, hence a score of 0.8. Comments mention phrases like 'had my heart rate up' and 'great class,' indicating an energetic and enjoyable experience reminiscent of 'The Endorphin Wave', which gets a score of 0.5. The short duration and music-enhanced environment further emphasize a nightclub-style class rather than a gritty or overly intense experience typical of warrior or firestarter vibes."
