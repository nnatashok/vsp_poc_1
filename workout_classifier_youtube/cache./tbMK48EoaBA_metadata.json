    "A little cry at the end makes me feel how necessary this was. Adriene, you\u2019re a life changer. Everyday.",
    "I just want to say I\u2019m so happy that you\u2019ve kept the same introductory music and video to lead into your practice after so many years. I began following your videos in 2013 and it\u2019s like home to hear that beginning song and the shot of young Adriene in siddhasana. Thank you for keeping this the same!",
    "Exhale day 21\ud83c\udf89 a little bit of breath work to start the day in the best way, thank you, Adriene, for this practice. \ud83d\udc96\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",
    "Discovering the breath has been an amazing addition !! Ps Benji is so ZEN - our quick breath activity had my pup doing circls lol ! Thank you Adriene for your continual efforts and blessings, May you be blessed today!",
    "Blessed Beloved Beauties! Exhale Day -  21 is an ideal return to the practice after a brief hiatus. I began to feel uneasy last Friday and couldn&#39;t keep anything on my stomach not even ginger ale or crackers. Thankfully, the following day the nausea subsided and I successfully kept down ginger ale, soup \ud83c\udf72 broth, and crackers. I spoke with a nurse on Saturday and we ruled out many things that aren&#39;t with the  symptom of nausea only; no stomach virus, or any other virus, and no ear ache. Well, I&#39;m getting better every day, and my stomach began to feel tight with subtle cramps off and on the next day, so hubby will go with me to the doctor&#39;s office Saturday to have my vitals checked. I&#39;m grateful for the final return to the yoga mat. This session is healing and therapeutic. How has everyone else been? Best wishes, everyone! \ud83e\udd8b\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd8b"
