  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily focused on teaching viewers how to start with calisthenics, as evident from the title \"How To Start Calisthenics in 2025 (BEST EXERCISES)\" and the recurrence of the term 'calisthenics' in the tags like \"calisthenics for beginners,\" \"calisthenics workout,\" \"calisthenics tutorial.\" The detailed breakdown of exercises like pull-ups, inverted rows, push-ups, and dips further supports this as these are classic calisthenics moves. The description explicitly mentions bodyweight as a core part of the workout, linking to a beginner bodyweight program, which aligns with the 'Body weight' category. The score for 'Calisthenics' is high (0.8) due to the video's strong focus and educational angle on beginner calisthenics. 'Body weight' has a moderate score (0.6) as these exercises are fundamental to building strength without additional weights, although the primary focus is clearly calisthenics methodologies. Comments and further channel context, referencing foundational exercises, support these classifications."
