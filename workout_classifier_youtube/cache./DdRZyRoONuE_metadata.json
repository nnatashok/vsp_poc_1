    "Lost 5kg and fitness is up so much thanks to this channel. Doing it on a cheap spin bike just copying the knees of the guests for cadence. Love this channel \u2764\ufe0f",
    "Great session! Sweating over here in Illinois for sure! Please keep adding 40-50 minute workouts!!",
    "As a 62 yr old from Ohio...heart attack...double bypass recipient...love doing the GCN workouts. My wife and I got into cycling bout 2 yrs ago and are hooked. We do outside rides in the warmer months, but in the colder months we use the indoor trainer with GCN workouts.GREAT JOB TO ALL!",
    "I\u2019m 66 and still enjoying these sessions, today was a tough one\u2026thanks all.",
    "I have an Echelon Connect Sport spin bike. My 0 exertion at 80BPM was at gear 18. Each gear was worth one, so my perceived effort of 10 was gear 28. This was awesome. Mixed in with my GCN 20 HIIT workouts, I&#39;m getting the best of both long and short routes whilst living through another Canadian winter. You guys rock. Cheers for everything you do."
