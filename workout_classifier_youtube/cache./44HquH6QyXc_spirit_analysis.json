  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified under 'Structured & Disciplined' due to its emphasis on a methodical approach suitable for beginners in Pilates. The title 'Introduction to Pilates' suggests a foundational, instructional design. The description mentions an introductory course with slow-paced, low-impact movements, emphasizing a structured progression. The score of 0.7 indicates a clear match, albeit not a perfect one, as the video is not heavily focused on technical precision to the exclusion of other elements. 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is prominent, with a score of 0.8. The language used, such as 'gentle and slow-paced,' the focus on safety, recovery from injuries, and suitability for those with low fitness levels, aligns well with restorative qualities. Viewer comments also mention the slow, clear guidance of the instructor, reinforcing this classification. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' are excluded due to the workout's explicitly described low intensity. The combination of these assessments guides the confidence level to be high at 0.9."
