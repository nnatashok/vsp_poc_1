  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout described is centered around indoor cycle training, as evidenced by the title \"Race Winning Intervals Workout - Indoor Cycle Training\" and tags such as \"wahoo trainer,\" \"indoor training,\" and \"cycling workout.\" The description explicitly mentions instructions for a \"race winning interval session,\" typically performed on a stationary cycle. The comments further reinforce this, with one user mentioning doing the workout on a basic indoor spinning bike, expressing a desire to upgrade to a Wahoo smart trainer, which indicates the use of an exercise bike for optimal participation. Thus, the confidence score for requiring an exercise bike is very high at 0.9."
