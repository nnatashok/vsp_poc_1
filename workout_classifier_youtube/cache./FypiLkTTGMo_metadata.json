  "channelDescription": "This is the official account for the Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh and our centers practicing in the Plum Village Tradition. \n\nPlum Village, in southwest France, is the first monastic community founded by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh (Thay) in the West. Plum Village is where Thay has realized his dream of building a Beloved Community: creating a healthy, nourishing environment where people can learn the art of living in harmony with one another and with the Earth.\n\nAt all our centers we weave mindfulness into all our daily activities, training ourselves to be mindful throughout the day: while eating, walking, working, or enjoying a cup of tea together. We enjoy periods of silence, sitting meditation, rest, relaxation, mindful work and play.  On this YouTube channel we are sharing Dharma talks, guided meditations, songs and chants from the Plum Village Tradition.",
