  "vibesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe with high confidence due to its focus on a 'Cardio Pilates' session that combines Pilates movements with cardio flows to elevate heart rate, as mentioned in both the title and description. The inclusion of music (from Epidemic Sound) further indicates a rhythmic, feel-good session. Commenters express enjoyment and positive body responses over consistent sessions, reinforcing the steady, elevated energy and feel-good movement typical in 'The Endorphin Wave.'\n\nAdditionally, 'The Groove Session' is also a strong match, given the channel's background in dance, which reflects in the workout's enjoyable, fluid nature and enthusiasm shared by users in comments. The instructor's background in dance and the expressive, engaging nature of the workout described in the comments support this vibe.\n\n'Rhythmic Powerhouse' is a moderately strong match considering the workout's music-infused exercise.
