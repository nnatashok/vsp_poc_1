  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video '15-Minute Walk-Run Intervals | Follow Along Treadmill Workout!' embodies two primary spirits: 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Flow & Rhythm'. The interval training format suggested in the title and description involves alternating between walking and running, which creates a cardiovascular challenge indicative of 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.7. The description emphasizes calorie burning and boosting endurance, aligning with intense workouts.\n\nAdditionally, the use of music (as noted in the description mentioning specific remix songs) and the guided, seamless transitions between walking and running suggest an element of 'Flow & Rhythm', scored at 0.65. The continuous movement and coordination in aligning with music-driven pacing resonate well with this spirit.\n\nWhile the workout incorporates a structured interval approach, 'Structured & Disciplined' was not deemed a primary spirit as the focus is more on rhythm and intensity rather than precise technical structuring. The feedback from users, such as holding certain speeds and improving performance, supports the high-energy and flowing nature of the session."
