  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a yoga-based workout titled '10 Min Yoga Full Body Stretch.' Yoga workouts typically require a mat for comfort and safety, especially when performing floor exercises, poses, and stretches. The description states it's a yoga routine designed to improve flexibility, suggesting floor movements that would benefit from a mat. Tags like 'yoga stretch,' 'yoga follow along,' and 'full body yoga' further imply mat use. Although the mat is not explicitly mentioned, the context and standard practices for yoga sessions provide very high confidence (0.9) that a mat is needed."
