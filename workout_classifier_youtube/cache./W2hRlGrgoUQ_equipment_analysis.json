  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video focuses on a 10-minute yoga routine for beginners, which is typically performed with a mat. The description explicitly mentions that the class can be done 'on the mat' or even in bed, but given that most yoga routines are practiced on a mat, it is likely the central equipment here. The tags also include terms like 'morning yoga', and 'yoga for back pain', which suggest a typical yoga setting that includes a mat. Therefore, a mat is considered essential for this routine, assigned with a very high confidence score of 0.8."
