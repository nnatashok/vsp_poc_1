  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"Yoga\" with a strong score of 0.9 due to the repeated emphasis on yoga practices in the title, description, and tags, such as \"yin yoga\", \"yoga stretch\", and \"full body yoga\". The channel's focus on yoga, as indicated by its name \"Yoga With Bird\" and description of the creator as a certified yoga teacher, further supports this categorization. Additionally, the video is tagged with yoga-related terms and the description mentions it as a yoga session aimed at relaxation and flexibility, reinforcing the yoga classification. \n\nThe secondary category is \"Stretching\" with a score of 0.8 because the workout explicitly aims to \"deeply stretch the entire body\" and is described as a \"full body stretch\" targeted at increasing flexibility, as per the metadata. The emphasis on body stretching aligns closely with the \"Stretching\" category. The video's comments also support the relaxation and stretching aspects, contributing to the chosen categories. \n\nThe categories are chosen with very high confidence based on explicit indicators in the title and keyword use in the tags."
