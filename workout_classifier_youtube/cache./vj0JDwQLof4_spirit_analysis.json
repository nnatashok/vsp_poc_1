  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a very high confidence level. The title and description focus on 'guided meditation' and 'self-love,' which implies a gentle, healing-focused session promoting relaxation and emotional well-being. The tags such as 'mindfulness meditation,' 'positive energy meditation,' and 'self-love meditation' further reinforce the restorative nature of this session, aiming to reduce stress and promote mental peace. The comments also reflect emotional relief and peace achieved through the meditation, which aligns well with the Soothing & Restorative spirit.\n\nA secondary, less emphasized spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a moderate confidence score. Although the primary purpose is relaxation and emotional healing, the guided nature of the meditation involves a certain degree of flow and continuity as the instructor leads participants through the session, aligning with elements of rhythm and mind-body connection. Other potential spirits were considered but excluded due to insufficient indicators of physical intensity, discipline, athleticism, or environmental interaction."
