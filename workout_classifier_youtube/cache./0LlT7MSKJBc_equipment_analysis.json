  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is explicitly described as a 'no equipment' workout, which is directly mentioned in the title and description. The listed exercises (squat to knee drive, reverse plank marches, shoulder tap plank jacks, kneel to squat thrust, explosive jacks) are all bodyweight exercises, further supporting that no equipment is necessary. The tags also emphasize 'no equipment,' reinforcing the concept of a bodyweight-only routine. Additionally, comments from viewers express appreciation for the lack of equipment, allowing them to perform the workout anywhere. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, requiring no additional equipment."
