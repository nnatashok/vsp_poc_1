  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout title '40 MIN PILATES YOGA WORKOUT' and description explicitly frame the session as a fusion of Pilates and yoga, both of which traditionally involve floor exercises, thereby typically requiring a mat. Additionally, the description includes a promotional link for a Liforme yoga mat, further reinforcing the importance of using a mat for this workout. The confidence score of 0.9 reflects the explicit mention of the mat in the description and its centrality to the activities described in the video."
