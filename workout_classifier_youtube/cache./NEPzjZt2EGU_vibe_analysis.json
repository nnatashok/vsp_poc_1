  "vibesExplanation": "The analysis of the video suggests a strong \"The Zen Flow\" vibe, evidenced by the emphasis on grounding and breath-centered techniques typical in slow-flow yoga or tai chi. The title 'Guided Meditation' alongside tags such as 'mindfulness meditation', 'calm', 'feeling relaxed', and 'relaxation music' strongly indicate a focus on unhurried, intentional movement and deep relaxation, fitting the Zen Flow vibe. A score of 0.9 reflects the strong match due to its comprehensive meditation approach and the influence of a spiritual guide. \n\nAdditionally, the video strongly embodies \"The Deep Recharge\" vibe, warranted by descriptions of achieving a \"deep relaxation\", and the focus on transforming negative emotions into a positive state. Comments frequently mention feelings of comfort, stress relief, and emotional release, highlighting an \"ultra-gentle movement\" suitable for resetting the nervous system. Given the intense relaxation focus and the meditative guidance from a spiritual leader, a score of 0.8 appropriately reflects this vibe alignment. \n\nOverall, the video relies heavily on emotional transformation and relaxation rather than purely physical elements, confirming high confidence in this assessment."
