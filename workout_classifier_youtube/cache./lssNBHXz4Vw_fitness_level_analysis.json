  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for this guided meditation video is assigned as 'Beginner' with high confidence. Meditation involves minimal physical movement and coordination, focusing instead on mental relaxation and mindfulness, which is accessible to almost all fitness levels. The metadata, including tags like 'easy meditation' and 'calm meditation,' supports this classification. Guided meditations like this typically require little to no physical exertion, aligning with beginner-level technique complexity.",

  ],
  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.95,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as 'Light' with high confidence based on the metadata. Meditation is inherently a low-energy expenditure activity, requiring no intense physical effort. The video duration of 21:53 does not affect this rating because the activity itself is inherently sedentary and relaxing, focusing on mental states rather than physical exertion. This aligns with the general purpose of meditation as indicated in the tags and description, such as 'calm meditation' and 'guided meditation for abundance.'",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner' with a secondary 'Intermediate' classification. This decision is based on the technique and effort difficulties assessed as beginner and light, respectively. Meditation demands mental endurance more than physical fitness, and despite the video's longer duration, it remains accessible to most individuals, including complete beginners. Given the general understanding of meditation as accessible and the user-friendly nature conveyed in the tags and description, the video is suitable primarily for beginners but also intermediate practitioners seeking enhanced mindfulness practice."
