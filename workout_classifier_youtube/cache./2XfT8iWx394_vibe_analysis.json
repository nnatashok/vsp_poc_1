  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe of 'The Zen Flow' was primarily chosen due to the emphasis on yoga and the channel's focus on mindfulness and mental stillness as seen in both the video and user comments. The description highlights a 'rest day' practice, suggesting a grounding, breath-centered flow. The comments also mention a calming pace and a gradual return to exercise, supporting this vibe. 'The Reboot Workout' was also chosen due to the association with a restorative practice for recovery and relaxation, hinted at by mentions of its suitability for athletes and beginners and the focus on balance and body awareness. The moderate duration and mention of 'full body yoga' indicate a holistic yet gentle approach, further supporting these selections."
