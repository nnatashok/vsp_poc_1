  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout focuses on basic bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, and push-ups, which are indicated as 'beginner strength exercises' in the description. These movements are simple and straightforward, aligning strongly with a Beginner technique difficulty (score: 0.9), as they require minimal coordination. Intermediate is also included (score: 0.5) due to some exercises like '3-Pulse Reverse Lunge + Knee Drive' and 'Bicycle Crunch' that require slightly more coordination than typical beginner movements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of 45 seconds of work with 15-second rest intervals, making it a low-intensity routine. The description states it's a 'total body workout for beginners,' suggesting a Light effort difficulty (score: 0.8). However, given the duration of over 20 minutes and continuous nature with no repeats, it also has characteristics of Moderate effort (score: 0.7) as it can pose a cumulative challenge, especially for deconditioned users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is explicitly designed for beginners, as noted in the title and description, resulting in a strong classification for Beginner (score: 0.8). However, the workout's duration slightly reduces its accessibility to very unfit beginners, shifting some classification to Intermediate (score: 0.7). The consistent pace and inclusion of slightly complex movements, along with the descriptors from comments indicating added modifications by users, justify including an Advanced level, though at a lower alignment (score: 0.4). This ensures a wide range for users who might progress in the workout series."
