    "Hello my friends! How are you feeling today?",
    "I\u2019ve had neck issues for years and also did daily PT. I would have extreme neck pain and burning twice a week for over a decade. I\u2019ve used Biofreeze and Salonpas Patches for relief. My BFF sent me this video on a whim. Since practicing yoga using the video every morning, my neck pain is nearly diminished. It\u2019s truly been life changing. Typically, I don\u2019t post comments, but I wanted to thank Adrienne for changing the quality of my life.",
    "Wow... that was my first time ever doing yoga stuff. It felt really good... I\u2019m kinda shaking now lol  my name is Joseph, I\u2019m a disabled Iraq war veteran a father of two and coming on two years since my wife passed away. I\u2019ve been in a very dark place to say the least. I\u2019m slowly coming out of it and have been looking for natural was to deal with all my physical and emotional pain. So happy to have found you sharing your knowledge of yoga, I could never afford to have a private lesson. I will be doing a lot of your lessons that deal with weight, back and neck pain to start with . Thank you again, I really enjoyed it. Keep up the amazing job \ud83d\udc9c",
    "One of my favorite bed-time rituals is rotating my neck round and round, a soundtrack of cricks and cracks following from my joints, and murmuring &quot;daily neck hygiene is soooooo important&quot; while my husband watches, terrified.",
    "Wow love this so much \ud83d\ude2eam a very farmer from Uganda and sometimes I have a lot of Neck, shoulders and also upper back pain back after doing this yoga I really feel good for sure thanks so much for giving your time for helping us may God bless you"
