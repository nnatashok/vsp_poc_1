  "vibesExplanation": "The workout vibe is predominantly identified as 'The Reboot Workout' with a score of 0.9. This is supported by the title 'POST-WORKOUT STRETCH for Injury Prevention & Flexibility,' indicating a focus on gentle stretching and recovery, fitting the qualities of total-body refresh and low stress management. The description and comments affirm the workout's role in mobility improvement and relief following more intense activity. Comments reflect a calming, restorative experience ('felt like 2 minutes,' 'calming') reinforcing the 'Reboot' vibe. \n\nThe 'Zen Flow' vibe scores 0.7, highlighting elements of grounding and intentional, breath-centered movement. This is supported by comments appreciating the calming effect of the workout and the speaker's soothing voice, indicative of a slower, focused routine consistent with the vibe description. Less relevant vibes, such as intense or high-energy ones, were excluded due to the workout's rehabilitative and calming nature."
