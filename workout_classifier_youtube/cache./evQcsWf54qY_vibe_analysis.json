The description emphasizes 'low-impact', 'relaxing warm-up', and 'energizing bodyweight exercises', aligning with a total-body refresh, hence a strong score of 0.8. 'The Comfort Moves' vibe is also relevant as it targets a special physical condition (PMS) and is described as 'gentle workout for PMS'. This suggests a safe and cozy experience, scoring 0.7. Lastly, 'The Zen Flow' is applicable because the workout is described as 'move with intention', indicating a grounding and intentional practice, thus receiving a score of 0.6. Other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' were excluded due to the lack of high intensity or explosive elements."
