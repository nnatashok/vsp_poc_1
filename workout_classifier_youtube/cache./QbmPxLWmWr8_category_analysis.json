  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified in the 'Mat' category with a high score of 0.9. The evidence for this classification comes from the title and description, which emphasize a 'No Jumping/Apartment Friendly, No Equipment' workout, indicating exercises likely performed on an exercise mat. Additionally, the description refers to the workout as 'full body cardio' with no equipment, which aligns with typical mat workouts that involve body movements such as floor exercises. Furthermore, the reference to being able to perform the workout at home or in an apartment reinforces the 'Mat' categorization, as mat exercises are quiet and floor-based, making them ideal for such settings. \n\nThe 'Body weight' category is also applicable with a score of 0.6, supported by the mention of 'No equipment needed' in the description, suggesting that the workout relies on body weight resistance for the exercises. This is further supported by tags like 'cardio no equipment' and user comments reporting feeling out of breath, implying vigorous body movement likely using body weight. The absence of jumping suggests exercises might include low-impact bodyweight movements instead. The categories of 'HIIT', 'Pilates', and 'Yoga' were excluded as there are no indications of intervals, controlled core exercises, or meditative components."
