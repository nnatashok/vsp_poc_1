  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit identified for this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is evidenced by the video's focus on breathwork and meditation practices aimed at stress and anxiety relief, as highlighted in the title (\"Breathwork & Meditation Practice | Pranayama Techniques | Stress & Anxiety Relief\"). The description reinforces this as it mentions the purpose of providing a 'clear, calm, and energized mind' and is suitable for individuals who feel 'ungrounded, overworked, or mentally overstimulated.' Comments from users such as feeling 'calm but not without energy' and using it for 'relaxation' further support this classification. The presence of yoga and breathing tags suggest a secondary 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with a score of 0.4, as these activities often involve smooth and rhythmic breathing patterns. However, this is not the primary focus as the session is more about relaxation than movement or coordination."
