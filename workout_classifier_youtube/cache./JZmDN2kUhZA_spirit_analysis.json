  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as primarily 'Sport & Agility' (0.8) due to its focus on cycling, a sport that demands coordination, reflexes, and cycling-specific skills. The title includes 'Cycling Workout' and mentions components like 'Rollers' and 'Static Trainer,' which are typically used for performance-based training. Furthermore, the channel's owner is a cyclist known for participating in races and sports-related content, indicating a sports-oriented approach.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also present (0.6), as the workout involves specific equipment and techniques (rollers and turbo trainers) which suggest a methodical approach to developing cycling skills. The mention of 'Beginners' and 'Stage 1 of Tour De Kids' in the description suggests a structured progression suitable for learning. This spirit aligns with technical precision and goal-oriented training.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' and 'High-Energy & Intense' could be considered but were excluded as the tone is specifically tailored for kids and beginners, likely making the intensity moderate. The content doesn't emphasize gentleness or adventure strongly enough for other spirits."
