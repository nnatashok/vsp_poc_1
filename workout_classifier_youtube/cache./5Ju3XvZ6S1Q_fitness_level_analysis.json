  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is a 15-minute yoga stretch focused on relaxation and flexibility. 'Deep relaxation' and 'stretch the entire body' infer a calming, low-energy demand.

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulty, this workout is highly accessible to beginners with its calming and gentle nature. The instructor's emphasis on listening to one's body and modifying poses confirms this is beginner-suitable. However, the inclusion of slightly more complex poses like pigeon, as reflected in comments, and possible modification needs, justify an intermediate score for those who may wish to engage more fully or have baseline yoga experience."
