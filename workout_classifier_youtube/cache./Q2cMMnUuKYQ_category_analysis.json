  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is clearly centered on 'Body weight' exercises, as indicated by the tags 'bodyweight strength workout' and 'strength workout without equipment.' The title and description emphasize a 'full body strength workout (No Equipment)', reaffirming its primary focus on body weight exercises. This category is assigned a very high score of 0.9 due to the explicit emphasis on strength building using body weight as resistance, confirmed by the description and tags.\n\nA secondary category of 'Weight workout' is assigned a score of 0.4. Although the workout is primarily body weight-focused, the description suggests optional resistance using 'dumbbells, kettlebells, or weight vest' for those who want a more challenging session. This indicates a moderate presence of potential weighted exercises.\n\nOther categories, such as 'HIIT' or 'Calisthenics,' were considered but excluded due to the lack of interval training elements or gymnastic moves commonly associated with those workouts. The workout's no-repeat format and focus on 'time under tension' further support its classification under Body weight and potentially Weight workout."
