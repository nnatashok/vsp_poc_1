  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Mat' due to the focus on activities suited for low-impact and floor exercises like those mentioned in the title and tags such as 'low impact workout' and 'workout to do during period'. The video's goal is to be gentle and suitable for menstruation, aligning with typical mat exercises. The 'Stretching' category is also selected as a key component, evidenced by the tags 'stretch', '5-minute stretch', and the emphasis on reducing bloating and easing menstrual cramps, which are often addressed through stretching. The channel's content generally supports home-friendly exercises, synergizing with mat-based and stretching workouts. The confidence level is high (0.8) due to explicit metadata indicators, and the scores reflect significant presence without being sole central elements."
