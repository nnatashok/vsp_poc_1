    "Thank you so so very much Adriene! Thanks to your inspiration and wonderful teaching. I have committed to a regular, mostly daily home yoga practise for over two years and its thanks to you and your programmes. I have noticed a difference physically for sure (i was rocking the core today, something that i used to dread and hate but now do with a smile on my face!) but for me its been about connecting with my spirit and my breath (so this practise was spot on!) and how its carried off my mat into my consciousness, the way i treat others, deal with my emotions and being able to observe my actions and reactions on a daily basis. I thank you in my &#39;gratitude practise&#39; i have at the end of every session in shavasana / meditation; you are in a star studded line up of the tools of yoga, the  Universe and Spirit :D So so much love to you and gratitude, keep up the amazing work sis*star, you inspire so so many people. Arohanui (lots of love and community) from Aotearoa! (New Zealand) Please come visit here someday! I live in the paradise world of Wanaka and you would be a welcome guest anytime :-) xxx",
    "Adriene,   I am celebrating my 71st birthday with your class.  I am so very grateful to you.  Your happiness and positivity gives me hope, love and gratitude.  XOXXO",

    "There are days when i just don&#39;t feel like doing yoga. Today i&#39;ve come to the mat, did 18 minutes of the practice and stopped the video, i simply couldn&#39;t continue to follow it, it felt wrong. <br>I&#39;m writing this as a reminder of Adriene&#39;s words &quot;Find What Feels Good&quot;. Yoga doesn&#39;t always feel good and that&#39;s OK. I&#39;m still proud of myself for doing yoga almost daily for over a year now! I notice how my mind and body get stronger with every practice.<br>Thank you, Adriene!"
