  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a strong score of 0.9 due to its nature as a HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) session. The use of terms like 'push', 'hard push', and 'get ready to get sweaty' in the description indicates a vigorous and challenging workout aimed at pushing physical limits, as further supported by user comments highlighting the intensity and encouragement from Coach Veronica. The inclusion of a structured sequence of 'Warmup', 'HIIT Section', and 'Cooldown' suggests a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.7. This spirit is supported by the organized intervals and specific pacing guidelines provided in the workout's description. The absence of elements that emphasize music-driven flow, recovery focus, sports specificity, or outdoor adventure suggests exclusion of other spirits. Therefore, the workout is primarily high-energy and structured, with strong confidence in this classification based on complete metadata evidence."
