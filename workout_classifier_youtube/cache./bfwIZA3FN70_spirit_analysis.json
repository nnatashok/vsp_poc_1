  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout prominently embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, evidenced by phrases in the title and description like 'back pain relief,' 'physio guided,' 'gentle home exercise routine,' and 'mobility exercises for pregnancy.' These indicate a focus on gentle movement, relaxation, and pain alleviation rather than intensity or high-energy activity. The high praise for the exercises in the comments, such as feelings of relaxation and alleviated pain, further reinforce this classification, giving it a score of 0.9 for a very strong match.\n\nAdditionally, the workout presents elements of 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The video is guided by a physiotherapist and involves a methodical series of exercises, indicating a structured approach, reflected in detailed guidelines and specific exercise names like 'Pelvic tilts' and 'Kneeling lunge stretches'. This earns it a moderate match score of 0.6.\n\nThe exclusion of 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Flow & Rhythm,' 'Sport & Agility,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits is due to the absence of indicators such as high intensity, rhythmic coordination, sports-specific training, or an outdoor setting."
