  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is clearly classified under the 'Stretching' category due to multiple explicit references in the title, tags, and description that indicate its focus on flexibility and being a beginner-friendly stretch routine. The title '15 Minute Beginner Stretch Flexibility Routine!' explicitly mentions 'stretch,' suggesting the primary objective of improving flexibility. Many tags support this, such as 'beginner flexibility routine,' 'stretching follow along,' 'stretching exercises for beginners,' and 'stretching for flexibility.' Furthermore, the detailed description lists various stretching exercises, including 'Child Pose,' 'McKenzie push Up,' and 'Hip swivels.' The positive comments about the video include experiences of improved flexibility and reduced stiffness, further reinforcing the stretching focus. The absence of high-intensity or strength training elements, and the clear intention to improve mobility and flexibility, excludes potential categories like 'HIIT,' 'Yoga,' or 'Body weight.' This strong consistency across metadata and user feedback provides very high confidence in the 'Stretching' classification."
