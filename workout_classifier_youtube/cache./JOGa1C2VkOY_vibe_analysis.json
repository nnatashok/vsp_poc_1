  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is titled '10 MIN Full Body Calisthenics Workout For Beginners (On The Bars)', indicating a structured, skills-building approach suited for beginners, aligning well with 'The Progression Quest'. This vibe is strengthened by the description's mention of building strength and endurance, suggesting incremental improvement, further supported by viewer comments praising the workout's effectiveness over two months of practice. Therefore, a score of 0.75 reflects its strong alignment.\n\n'Foundation Builder' also fits because the workout is designed for beginners to establish basic calisthenics skills ('basic calisthenics', 'calisthenics basics'), focusing on foundational exercises like pull-ups and push-ups. This justifies a 0.6 score, reflecting its secondary focus on core skills development.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Disciplined Grind' is apt because of the emphasis on discipline and execution without equipment ('you don't need weights...'). This aligns with consistency and commitment to skill development seen in calisthenics, warranting a score of 0.7.\n\nWhile intense, this workout lacks the express heart-pounding pace of 'Warrior' or 'Firestarter' vibes, focusing more on technique and steady progress."
