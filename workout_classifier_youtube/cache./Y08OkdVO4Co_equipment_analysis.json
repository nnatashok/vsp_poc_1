  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video metadata explicitly states that no equipment is needed for this workout. The title \"20 Minute Full Body Workout At Home - No Equipment\" clearly indicates that the workout is designed to be performed without any equipment. The description reinforces this by stating, \"All you need is your body and your devices (mobile, laptop, TV) to get this party started!\" This emphasizes that the exercises are body-weight based and can be completed with nothing more than the viewer's own body. The tags also include terms like \"body weight workout\" and \"at home exercise,\" further suggesting that the workout is intended to be performed without any additional equipment. Consequently, there is very high confidence (0.9-1.0) that no equipment is required for this workout, leading to an empty array as the requiredEquipment output since it is a bodyweight-only routine."
