  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The routine includes very basic and fundamental stretches aimed at beginners, such as neck side flexion, child pose, and McKenzie push-ups, which require minimal coordination. The inclusion of movements like 'Frog pose rocks' slightly elevates the technique difficulty to provide some challenge for those at the beginner to intermediate transition. However, the focus on basic stretches underpins its primary classification as 'Beginner'. Most movements are static or simple dynamic stretches, requiring little coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 15-minute stretching routine with a focus on flexibility which inherently involves low energy expenditure. It's aligned with light effort difficulty due to the gentle nature of static and slow dynamic stretches. The comments from older individuals and beginners experiencing relief and ease with this routine reinforce its classification as 'Light'. Some elements, like 'Squat to pike', slightly increase the effort, but the emphasis on stretching maintains the primary 'Light' classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the beginner-focused title and tag descriptors, along with the presence of basic movements, this routine primarily serves beginners. User comments strongly indicate accessibility for those new to exercise or with limited flexibility experience, such as older adults with no prior stretching. Intermediate inclusion reflects minimal transition complexity in movements like 'Frog pose rocks', which might pose a slight challenge to absolute novices but is manageable for those slightly more advanced. The routine is accessible enough for a broad range of beginners and early intermediates."
