  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for this workout video clearly indicates it is a bodyweight-only routine. The title explicitly states \"NO EQUIPMENT,\" which suggests that no additional items are needed to perform this workout. This is reinforced by the tags, which include 'bodyweight workout' and 'no equipment', emphasizing that the exercises can be performed without any external apparatus. The comments provide insight into the exercises included, such as push-ups and plank variations, which are traditionally performed using just body weight. Thus, no equipment is necessary for this workout, and the confidence in this classification is very high, resulting in an empty array of required equipment."
