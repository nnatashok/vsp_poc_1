  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Guided Meditation for Anxiety' video is predominantly characterized by a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This classification is supported by the video title and description, which emphasize the focus on relieving anxiety and promoting relaxation (\"Relieve anxiety with this guided meditation\" and \"The Hourglass is the perfect way to unwind\"). Moreover, the channel Priory is dedicated to mental health improvement, which aligns with the therapeutic and calming nature typical of 'Soothing & Restorative' sessions. The high viewership and engagement indicate its effectiveness and resonance with viewers seeking relaxation and stress relief. The minor presence of 'Flow & Rhythm' is due to the structured and rhythmic guidance implied in the use of a ticking clock sound mentioned in the comments, providing a gentle, continuous background focus for meditation, although this is secondary to its primary relaxing intent. Other workout spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are irrelevant here, given the focus on mental calmness rather than physical exertion or athletic training."
