  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"High-Energy & Intense,\" supported by explicit mentions of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and Tabata's structure focusing on maximum effort during short 20-second work intervals with 10-second rests. The description emphasizes an energetic and heart-pumping experience, underscoring this spirit with terms like \"sprint,\" \"boosts energy,\" and \"feeling ALIVE\" after workouts. A confidence score of 0.9 reflects the strong alignment with this spirit, given the intense nature of Tabata protocols.\n\nThe \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit also applies, as evidenced by the workout's adherence to a specific Tabata protocol with defined work-rest cycles, reflecting a methodical and disciplined approach to training. The description and tags mention guidance on how to manage RPMs and resistance, further supporting a structured format. This spirit scores 0.7 due to these structured elements.\n\nLastly, \"Flow & Rhythm\" is represented through the mention of music synchronization such as the music driving interval recognition and motivation during the workout. The mention of specific songs contributing to the workout experience justifies a moderate score of 0.5 for this spirit. This secondary selection recognizes the influence of rhythm and coordination in the session, albeit as a supporting element."
