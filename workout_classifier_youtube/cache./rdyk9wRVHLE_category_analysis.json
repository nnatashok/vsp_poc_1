  "categoriesExplanation": "The video title, \"Full Body Stretch | Mobility Routine for Flexibility & Relaxation,\" and tags such as \"stretching,\" \"flexibility,\" \"stretch,\" and \"mobility routine\" strongly indicate that the primary purpose of the workout is focused on Stretching. This is reinforced by the description, which highlights a smooth stretch routine and mobility workouts, supporting a high confidence classification in the Stretching category with a score of 0.9.\n\nThe tags and description also mention \"yoga,\" and the comments describe the workout as calming and grounding, which are often characteristics of Yoga practices. However, given the stronger focus on stretching over Yoga-specific activities, Yoga is assigned a score of 0.7.\n\nA mention of \"Pilates\" in the tags, along with the emphasis on flexibility and mobility, suggests some overlap with Pilates exercises, as Pilates often includes elements of these. However, the explicit focus on stretching makes Pilates a secondary association with a lower score of 0.4. \n\nOverall, the video is predominantly focused on Stretching, with additional elements suggestive of Yoga and mild evidence pointing toward Pilates."
