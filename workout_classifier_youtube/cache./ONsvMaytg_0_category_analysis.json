  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is clearly focused on specialized breathing techniques designed to support the release of DMT and provide a meditative experience. The title explicitly mentions 'Guided Breathing,' and tags like 'breathwork,' 'breathing technique,' 'guided breathing,' 'DMT breathing technique,' and 'meditation' strongly indicate a focus on breathing exercises. This justifies the high score of 0.95 for the Breathing exercises category.\n\nAdditionally, the description and comments suggest benefits aligned with meditation, such as self-discovery, emotional release, and altered states of consciousness. The reference to 'getting in a calm meditative state' and user comments about life-changing experiences and altered perceptions indicates meditation elements, supporting a score of 0.75 for the Meditation category.\n\nOther categories, such as 'Yoga,' are tagged but are likely to mislead given the core focus on breathing, not physical postures typical of yoga sessions. No other categories fit as the workout centers around intentional breath control for mental and emotional benefits."
