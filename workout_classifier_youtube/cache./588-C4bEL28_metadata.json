    "Can we just acknowledge the fact the writing on the screen matches her outfits?  I think it is like that every time. It&#39;s the little details. The little ones that tell us you care.",
    "61 and am going heavy but keeping up. Your enthusiasm and desire to be as excellent as you can be is just fantastic. I feel I should be paying you something!",
    "To be successful in anything in life, they say stay in a community with like mindedness people. I am glad I found one here and we all strive with the Queen Caroline. I am just gonna smash this one, so help me God. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udd25",
    "First timer - I loved the workout! Exactly what I was looking for - challenging - low key (no excessive cheerleading) and no hip hop in the background:). I am hooked.",
    "I was overwhelmed with some sort of bittersweet feeling and I started crying. It was such a genuine feeling. I used to hate lunges and think push up pulses are impossible. And I did them today and did them good. I am born and bred in an extremely patriarchal city. At a young age, I realized I had a passion for physical workout. I have no doubt that despite being so resilient I would have broke and given up if it weren&#39;t for so many writers who wrote amazing, detailed magical stories about impossible women, those movie makers, those social heroines, the impossible doers like Caroline. <br>Thank you so much, Caroline. Now that I have had the taste of it I will never settle for anything less.\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc85\ud83d\udc97"
