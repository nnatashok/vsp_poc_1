  "vibesExplanation": "The workout vibes for this video primarily align with 'The Reboot Workout' due to its focus on gentle stretching to decrease tightness and enhance flexibility, as indicated by phrases in the title and description such as 'decrease tension and pain' and 'perfect for beginners'. The score of 0.9 reflects a strong match as the routine serves to refresh and reset the body without high intensity or stress, typical of the Reboot Workout. \n\nSecondly, 'The Comfort Moves' receives a score of 0.7 because the routine is described as simple, beginner-friendly, and safe, designed to feel good and be accessible to a wide audience, including the elderly, which aligns with the comfort-centric characteristics.\n\nFinally, a moderate score of 0.6 for 'The Zen Flow' is appropriate since the workout emphasizes slow, intentional movements across major muscle groups, which echoes elements of a grounding and breath-centered practice, though it lacks the deep, mindful element typically seen in full Zen Flow workouts. Overall, confidence is high due to explicit mentions in comments and metadata about its beginner-friendly, refreshing, and tension-relieving properties."
