The tags and description explicitly mention 'stretches,' 'stretch routine', and 'pregnancy stretching exercises,' implying basic and gentle moves suitable for pregnant individuals, which are usually straightforward to perform. The presence of terms like 'pregnancy yoga' suggests a slight possibility of slightly more complex movements, justifying a minor consideration for intermediate-level technique. This aligns mostly with beginner movements given the target audience of pregnant women typically engaging in gentle exercise to manage discomfort.",

Comments from users suggest it's suitable for those new to regular exercise, including pregnant individuals with conditions such as Type 1 Diabetes, seeking easy entry into fitness. Given these users might experience energy limitations, the workout must be accessible. Whereas the slight consideration for intermediate level is due to yoga elements that could appeal to those with a minimal fitness foundation, encouraging the inclusion of mild challenge for slightly more experienced individuals."
