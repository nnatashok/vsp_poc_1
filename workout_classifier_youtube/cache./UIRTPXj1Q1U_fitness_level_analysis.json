  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video focuses on lower body stretches, particularly for hamstrings and hip flexors, which are classified as basic stretches. The metadata includes phrases such as '10 minute lower body stretch', 'stretches for sitting all day', and 'stretch follow along'.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration is approximately 12 minutes, primarily focused on stretching, which is inherently low-intensity and low on energy expenditure. The phrases 'quick, 10 minute lower body stretch routine', and 'relieve pain/tension' suggest a gentle routine aimed at relaxation and flexibility rather than intense exertion.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The simple and gentle nature of the workout, primarily comprising stretches, makes it extremely suitable for beginners, especially the deconditioned individuals. However, due to the possible flexibility improvements (as suggested by 'gain flexibility over time'), it could also appeal to those at an intermediate level looking for recovery or mobility enhancement."
