  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title explicitly states \"NO EQUIPMENT,\" implying that this 5-minute HIIT cardio workout does not require any tools or devices, focusing instead on bodyweight exercises. The description and tags further reinforce this by emphasizing terms like \"bodyweight workout,\" \"calisthenics,\" \"no equipment,\" and \"home workout.\" The top comments support the intensity and nature of the routine, with one noting how planks are used as \"rest breaks,\" indicating exercises performed without any equipment. Thus, it is clear that the workout is designed to be performed using only one's body weight, and no additional equipment is needed. This analysis leads to a conclusion of a bodyweight-only workout with a confidence score confirming no equipment needed."
