  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves basic strength exercises using dumbbells and bodyweight, which requires moderate coordination, placing it generally at an Intermediate level. The tags \u2018modifications provided\u2019 and \u2018beginner modifications\u2019 indicate options for less complex techniques. The use of weights can add complexity, but the exercises are not described as overtly challenging or technical, thus it remains accessible for those with some exercise experience. The additional options for lighter or no weights allowed for some Beginner-level techniques.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 35 minutes and the structure of 45 seconds work with 15 seconds rest suggests a Challenging effort level for deconditioned users, as continuous effort with minimal rest is demanding. Terms like 'full body strength' and user comments referring to the workout as \u2018doable\u2019 but requiring modifications support a Moderate to Challenging classification. The inclusion of a warm-up and cool down suggests a well-balanced session, but overall energy expenditure could be higher than a simple Moderate session.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique difficulty at Intermediate and availability of Beginner modifications justify the inclusion of both beginner and intermediate levels. The Challenging effort difficulty also supports Intermediate. Advanced inclusion is due to the potential to increase weights, which raises intensity for those more fit. Commentary from users who use varied weights and mention it being 'doable' underline the inclusiveness of multiple levels, especially with modifications. Despite a longer workout duration, modifications make it partially accessible for beginners, resulting in a range from Beginner to Advanced."
