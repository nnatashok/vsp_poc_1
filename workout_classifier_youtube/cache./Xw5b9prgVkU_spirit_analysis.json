  "spiritsExplanation": "The video title, description, and tags emphasize a fast-paced and intense workout, such as 'FEISTY & FUN,' 'short, intense, and effective,' and 'things move quickly,' indicating a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. The structured format, with specifically timed exercises (60 seconds work, 10 seconds rest) and a clear exercise list, aligns with a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, underscored by the workout's methodical approach and technical precision required for exercises like curls, squats, and renegade rows. The score for 'High-Energy & Intense' is 0.7, reflecting the dynamic and quick nature of the workout. 'Structured & Disciplined' scores 0.6 due to the formal structure and precise approach mentioned in the description. Other spirits were considered but not included as the workout is not focused on relaxation, smooth flow, sports agility, or outdoor elements."
