  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Breathing exercises' with a high score of 0.9. This decision is based on the title mentioning 'Guided Breathing' and the '15-day breathwork course' in the description. The tags 'wim hof' and 'wim hof method' further support breathwork's central role, as this method is known for specialized breathing techniques. User comments also emphasize the practice's impact on health and anxiety, aligning with the benefits of breathing exercises.\n\n'Meditation' is assigned a secondary rating of 0.7 due to the comments and description that suggest a meditative aspect of the practice, such as its calming effects and focus not being purely functional. Commenters describe feelings of gratitude, calmness, and readiness, typical outcomes of meditative practices.\n\nWeight workout, stretching, or other physical forms of exercise aren't mentioned or implied, reinforcing the exclusion of other categories. Overall, the metadata strongly indicates a session centered around breathing and a meditative approach."
