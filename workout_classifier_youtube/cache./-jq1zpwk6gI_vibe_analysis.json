  "vibesExplanation": "The video title and description emphasize metabolic conditioning coupled with intense, full-body strength training using dumbbells, aligning well with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe, characterized by primal energy and sweat-dripping efforts. The use of heavy weights and short rest periods further supports this selection. The score of 0.85 reflects the intensity and strength focus.\n\nThe phrase 'boost your metabolism and get strong' and user comments implying post-workout feelings of elation (e.g., \"I feel freaking amazing!\") suggest an 'Endorphin Wave' vibe, highlighting elevated energy and feel-good movement. The score of 0.7 reflects the steady build and elevated energy aspects of this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, the description's emphasis on building strength and the structured format indicate a potential 'Progression Quest' vibe, with methodical improvement through repeated circuits aimed at progress and endurance. The score of 0.55 reflects the structured, repetitious nature of the workout aimed at incremental improvement, though not as intensely focused on long-term progression as typically seen.\n\nOverall, these vibes are supported by both metadata and user feedback, with high confidence due to clear indicators in the workout's design and description."
