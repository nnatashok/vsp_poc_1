  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title, description, and description explicitly mention that no equipment is needed for this full body stretch workout. It is part of a 14-day challenge intended for recovery and improving mobility, and the description specifies 'Equipment: No Equipment.' Furthermore, the comments and additional channel information support the bodyweight-only nature of the workout, focusing on stretching and recovery, which aligns with workouts that typically require no equipment. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, requiring no specific equipment."
