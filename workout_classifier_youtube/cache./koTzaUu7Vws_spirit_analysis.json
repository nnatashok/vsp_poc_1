  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily exhibits the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit, as indicated by the Pilates focus and the continuous full body movements emphasized in the title and tags, such as \"pilates class\" and \"move with nicole.\" The channel's description highlights the instructor's background in dance, promoting a coordinated, rhythmic style. A score of 0.75 reflects high confidence, supported by this movement style and the music component mentioned in the description. \n\n\"Structured & Disciplined\" is also relevant, scoring 0.65. The video targets specific muscle groups and progression is evident in the term \"Intermediate Pilates Class\" and the structured feedback in comments, praising the instructive approach. Pilates itself is a highly disciplined practice, requiring precision and control.\n\nFinally, the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit receives a score of 0.5. Though it's an intermediate class, user comments about the calming and encouraging voice of the instructor suggest a gentle, holistic approach, despite the physical challenge. Non-inclusion of other spirits is justified, as there are no signs of high-energy intensity, explicit sports techniques, or outdoor elements."
