  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '20 Minute Beginner Flexibility Routine V2! (FOLLOW ALONG)' appears to be focused on a flexibility routine for beginners, as indicated by the terms 'flexibility routine', 'mobility routine', and 'beginner flexibility routine' in the tags. The description of the video emphasizes full body flexibility and mentions it helps increase range of motion, suggesting a series of bodyweight exercises. There is no explicit mention of any equipment in the title, description, or tags. The frequent references to 'yoga', 'stretching', and 'bodyweight' imply a bodyweight-focused session without the necessity of additional equipment. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this is a bodyweight-only routine with no additional equipment required. The absence of user comments mentioning specific equipment reinforces this conclusion."
