  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Beginner Full Body Stretching Routine- Workout with Jordan' is classified primarily as 'Soothing & Restorative' with high confidence (score: 0.9). This is evidenced by the focus on a full-body stretching routine, which is designed to alleviate soreness and stiffness, as noted in the description. The routine is described as easy-to-follow and suitable for beginners, further emphasizing its gentle nature. User comments underscore the restorative intent, with viewers noting improved flexibility and reduced discomfort. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also relevant, though to a lesser extent (score: 0.6), as the routine likely follows a methodical progression to ensure comprehensive body coverage, a typical characteristic of structured workout sessions. The channel, known for providing therapeutic and structured approaches to fitness, supports this secondary classification. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Flow & Rhythm' are excluded due to the lack of dynamic or fast-paced elements in the routine."
