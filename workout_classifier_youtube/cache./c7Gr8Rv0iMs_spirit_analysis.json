  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as evidenced by the title ('Full Body Stretch | Daily Routine for Flexibility, Mobility + Tight Muscles') and the description, which discusses active recovery, cooling down, and releasing tension in muscles. The focus is on healing, relaxation, and flexibility, making it a strong match with a score of 0.9. Additionally, the routine involves 'flowing through the routine' with smooth, continuous movements and a focus on breathing, aligning well with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, which is assigned a score of 0.7. The video's emphasis on stretching, mobility, and body awareness through structured sequences further supports this spirit. There is no indication of high intensity, structure beyond gentle progression, or outdoor elements, which excludes other spirits from consideration."
