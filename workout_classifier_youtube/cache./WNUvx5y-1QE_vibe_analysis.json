  "vibesExplanation": "The selected vibes for this workout video are \"The Warrior Workout,\" \"The Firestarter,\" and \"The Endorphin Wave,\" based on the analysis of its metadata.\n\n1. **The Warrior Workout (Score: 0.75):** The presence of \"HIIT\" (High-Intensity Interval Training) in both the title and tags suggests a challenging workout designed to push the participant's limits. The description and tags emphasize \"high intensity,\" \"full body,\" \"plyometric movements,\" and \"advanced,\" aligning with the sweat-dripping, heart-pounding characteristics of The Warrior Workout.\n\n2. **The Firestarter (Score: 0.7):** The workout is described as \"30 Minute,\" which indicates a shorter duration typical of The Firestarter vibe, characterized by fast, explosive sessions. The mention of explosive \"plyometric movements\" further supports this vibe, along with the video length being relatively short yet intense.\n\n3. **The Endorphin Wave (Score: 0.55):** The description mentions a \"fun\" workout and user comments highlight the \"good and refreshed\" feeling after completion, indicative of the feel-good, uplifting energy of The Endorphin Wave. However, the intensity markers point more strongly toward the other vibes.\n\nOther potential vibes such as \"The Groove Session\" were considered due to comments about the enjoyable music, but the primary focus on intensity and advanced workout movements made this less fitting."
