  "vibesExplanation": "The video is primarily geared towards beginners in calisthenics, focusing on building strength and muscle through a detailed and structured approach. This aligns closely with \"The Progression Quest\" vibe, as it emphasizes long-term improvement and methodical progression in calisthenics, with mentions of programming and templates (e.g., \"progressing in calisthenics\"). This vibe receives the highest score (0.9) due to strong evidence of goal-oriented progression.\n\n\"The Foundation Builder\" is also relevant with a score of 0.8, as the video content revolves around fundamental movements like pushing, pulling, and core exercises which are essential for strengthening weak points and perfecting basic techniques.\n\n\"The Masterclass Workout\" is moderately applicable (score of 0.7) because the video provides detailed, step-by-step guides for beginners, focusing on teaching and skill-building, which is characteristic of masterclass-style instruction. User comments like \"Informational and organized\" further highlight the technique-driven aspect.\n\nLess emphasis on intensity or competitive elements excludes vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Competitor.\" The confidence level is high at 0.85 due to explicit cues in the title, timestamps, and user comments, although some uncertainty about the intensity and personal coaching style remains."
