    "Nice ! I have waited all day to do this stretch and it accomplished exactly what it was meant to do... stress release and feeling relaxed !!! Thank you again for a great video !!!",

    "Lauren, I want to tell you a little story. I was recently visiting my 8-year-old granddaughter in California. Her parents are going through a divorce and things have been a little topsy turvy for her, alternating one week with Dad and one week with Mom. At bedtime my son had been letting her do some rough housing thinking it was a way for her to burn off some energy, but , of course, it had just the opposite effect. I suggested we all do your bedtime stretches instead. Well it calmed her down and she was able to go to bed without the usual hoopla. They have continued to do these stretches every night and bedtime has become a pleasure rather than a chore. So even though your channel is \u201cSenior Shape\u201d this video at least has brought some calm to a little girl and her dad during an otherwise stressful situation. You are so appreciated. \u2764",
    "My kids (son, 7 and daughter, 11) have been joining me for this stretch routine lately. We do it at bedtime and love how relaxing it is. Thank you so much!"
