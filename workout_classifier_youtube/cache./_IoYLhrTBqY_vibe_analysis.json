  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Reboot Workout' with a strong score of 0.9. This classification is based on the focus of the video on stretching, flexibility, and mobility, which aligns with the concept of a low-stress, total-body refresh. The description highlights stretching as a way to counteract stiffness from activities like sitting or intense training, further supporting this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Zen Flow' also applies with a score of 0.7, as the workout involves breath-centered, intentional movements typical of yoga and mobility work. The soothing nature of Pamela's voice, as mentioned in the comments, and the encouragement to use this routine regularly indicates a calming, grounding experience.\n\nThe workout lacks the intensity or fast-paced energy required for more vigorous vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter'. Instead, its focus on relaxation and gradual improvement in flexibility fits well with the selected vibes."
