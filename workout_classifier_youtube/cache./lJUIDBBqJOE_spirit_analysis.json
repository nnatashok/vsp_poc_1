  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit of this video is 'Soothing & Restorative' due to explicit mentions of 'stretching', 'rest days', 'calm down', 'muscles feel extra stiff or sore', 'mobility and flexibility', and 'before bed' in the title and description. These indicate a focus on recovery, relaxation, and stress reduction, fitting the spirit perfectly with a score of 0.9.\n\nThe secondary spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' is a mild match, scoring 0.3, due to the continuous movement and stretching pattern, and the mention of music involvement in the description. However, the focus is not primarily on synchronization with music or a flowing sequence, so this spirit is less dominant.\n\nThe tags and comments reinforce the restorative intent, discussing relaxation and the soothing aspect, with only a minor presence of rhythmic continuity. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are not suitable as there is a lack of indicators for intensity or structured training protocol. Overall, there is high confidence in the primary assignment due to clear metadata indicators."
