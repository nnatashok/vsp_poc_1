  "description": "Subscribe to GCN Training: https://gcn.eu/GCNTraining\n\nIndoor cycle training is one of the best ways to lose weight quickly and train for cycle events.\n\nBlack Friday Shop Range - http://gcn.eu/YI\nSubscribe to GCN: http://gcn.eu/SubscribeToGCN\nSign up to the GCN newsletter: http://gcn.eu/gcnnewsletter\n\nIf you're looking for a lunchtime workout to either tone up or prepare for a bike event with some cardio-vascular training this 20 minute HIIT session is just what you need. Get yourself set up on a static bike, be it an indoor bike, Wattbike or turbo trainer and follow the instructions on the screen. We've tried to make the sessions a bit tongue in cheek and fun, but at the same time, if you follow this session you will feel like you have had a proper workout. We know, we tried it!\n\nFor details of how GCN's training sessions run and work, see our guide to indoor training here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dq6UWX9c6A and for how to make sure your indoor bike is set up correctly, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_abRj3kInU\n\nFilmed at Pedal Studios in Wimbledon\n\nMusic - licensed by Cue Songs\nStereo MC's - Get On It: http://gcn.eu/YcsMfF\nGarrett & Ojelay - Daze Of Disco: http://gcn.eu/W0sJ89\nDiego Drums - Azteca: http://gcn.eu/YVEwzS \nCult 45 - Revolver: http://gcn.eu/16lzKmP\nThe Milk - Mr Motivator: http://gcn.eu/16lzQLa\nTristeza - Biege Finger: http://gcn.eu/WYQNnM\nStefano Azati - Fandango: http://gcn.eu/W0tspJ\nStefano Azati - Palermo: http://gcn.eu/ZDa00a\nBig Pimp Jones - Thoroughly Whipped Asses: http://gcn.eu/10CozG8\nCagedbaby - Lovers: http://gcn.eu/YVEUOS\n\nNot all exercises are suitable for everyone - there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach. As with any strenuous exercise, you should take into account factors such as your flexibility, strength and overall health to determine if an exercise is appropriate for you, and consult a doctor/physician before beginning a programme of exercise.

    "I&#39;ve never been more grateful of a 30 second YouTube ad in all my life.",
    "We tackled assembling the bike as a family project. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxzg0clhbtRf2gGxPkVETFKJJKGqdsorQu\">https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxzg0clhbtRf2gGxPkVETFKJJKGqdsorQu</a>  The package is heavy, but I have 2 teen boys that were able to move it. The written instructions were great- we didn&#39;t need to watch the videos, but it was good knowing that the option was there if we needed it. After we were able to get it set up, the boys each rode 3 miles and I rode 8 and the bike stayed quiet. The display is easy to reset, and you can put it on whichever setting you are using (time, distance, calories, etc). I will say that my butt is a little sore from the seat, but that could be because I haven&#39;t rode in a while. While it is comfortable for me, it was not comfortable with the seat position for my friend (could not move the seat back far enough and he slightly looked like a kid riding a tricycle that he had outgrown). He also said that the seat hurt his manly parts. We are going to look for a different seat that will be compatible with this bike for him.I did purchase the Wahoo Cadence sensor and strapped it to the crank of one of the pedals. This will sync with my Apple Watch, iPhone and will import data in to my Health app. Wahoo does have other sensors available other than cadence. I can also keep either my phone or my iPad on the display and they both feel pretty secure.",
    "Just want to say that doing this video 2 times a day ( 1 is fasted cardio) has changed my life! I\u2019m down 10 pounds in 2 months and my legs have gotten soo shapely! I\u2019ve always dreaded the treadmill because of my big breast but bike is just a lifesaver. Thank you so much for this video!! I\u2019ve done others but this one makes me sweat the most! Good job ladies!!!!",
    "This is amazing already lost 63lbs in 2 months doing this video 4times a week love  these videos thank you GCN.",
    "I am 190 I always been 145 my whole life at one point lower than that I&#39;ve gained over 50 lbs in the last 4 years and now that I am engaged I am wanting more to be healthy again. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx5VQ5nUzHu6i0O5_u7ipyLnCz0lbsSvr0\">https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx5VQ5nUzHu6i0O5_u7ipyLnCz0lbsSvr0</a> I am not fat but I am thick and have muscle. I am very close to how you were but a lil smaller but I am so sick people making comments to me like I&#39;m huge or like you said having shorts that used to be so cute on me and now I can&#39;t even find a pair to fit me. I used to love shopping now I don&#39;t even want to go to the store and if I do I pick the biggest size don&#39;t even try it on and deal with it. I went from size 5 to size idk because I don&#39;t even want to know the real number. I hate looking at pics of myself now or me before. thank you for your video it&#39;s time to make a change."
