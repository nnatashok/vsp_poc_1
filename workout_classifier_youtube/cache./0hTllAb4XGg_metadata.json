    "AWAKEN \ud83e\udd8b | April 12, 2025 | I&#39;m not a runner, and I wouldn&#39;t call myself a fierce walker \ud83d\ude06 but I do walk. At least I used to before my four legged walking buddy left us last summer. Since then I&#39;ve been struggling to get walking again by myself, it&#39;s just not the same. But now as the winter is finally loosening its grip on us, I&#39;m determined to get back to it. I probably should have saved this for after my walk today, but I had already rolled out the mat when I realized and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to make my walk that much sweeter. It really was such a treat today, getting into those hips and the low back too. Loved it! \ud83d\ude4f",
    "Tried to talk myself out of this practice this morning,  but found the strength to conquer it!!! Glad I did <br>Day 12 explore 2025<br>We are One<br>\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",
    "Awaken day 12! I\u2019ve been uncovering some trauma this evening and this practice came at the perfect moment. That hip release was something else. I\u2019m very grateful for this practice\ud83d\udc95<br>Thank you, Adriene and YWA community\ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udde1"
