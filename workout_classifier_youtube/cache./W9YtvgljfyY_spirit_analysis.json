  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this video is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.8. The video is a '10-Minute Guided Stretching Routine for Runners,' which is described as focusing on static stretches, suggesting a meditative and recuperative nature. Comments emphasize the relaxation and flexibility benefits, with one remarking on how the routine feels 'super relaxing' and another on flexibility improvements, indicating recovery and healing aspects.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Structured & Disciplined' at a moderate score of 0.6, due to the methodical approach of holding stretches for specific intervals (30 seconds for each), and targeting specific muscle groups for runners. The channel's description also emphasizes proper form and mobility, which aligns with a structured approach to fitness.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility,' do not fit the relaxed and focused nature of the routine, nor is there any element of 'Outdoor & Adventure' involved, as this is an indoor stretching session."
