  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Endorphin Wave' because it includes a combination of cardio and strength exercises in a structured format, with a focus on elevating energy and creating a feel-good movement experience over 60 minutes. The alternating periods of effort and rest ('45 seconds work, 15 seconds rest') and the mention of 'the afterburn effect' suggest a steady build of energy typical for endorphin-high workouts. \n\n'The Meditative Grind' is also applicable due to the structured, repetitive nature of interval training, where participants can zone in on their efforts. The workout includes an extended duration, repetitive intervals, and adjustments for different fitness levels, which allows participants to focus deeply on each movement. \n\nLastly, 'The Groove Session' is included as a potential vibe due to the 'Walking Cardio & Strength' and 'standing stretch and cooldown,' which suggest elements of fun and expressive movement. However, this is less pronounced due to the emphasis on structure and repetition. \n\nThe channels focus on fun, safe, and multi-level workouts for mature participants supports these classifications, emphasizing the enjoyable and inclusive nature of the workout."
