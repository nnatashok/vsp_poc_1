  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",
