  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video focuses on simple breathing exercises to manage panic attacks, which are straightforward and require minimal coordination or specific technical skill. The description mentions 'guided breath sounds' and focusing on a 'breath bubble', implying this exercise relies more on following along rather than executing complex movements. The simplicity of the techniques is highlighted by its aim to be calming and accessible, supporting a classification of Beginner for technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a low-intensity, 10-minute breathing exercise specifically designed to calm the individual and relieve stress and anxiety. The lack of physical movement and emphasis on relaxation inherently classifies this as light effort. User comments and the description further emphasize the simplicity and non-physical nature of the exercises, affirming its light effort classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the Beginner classification for technique difficulty and Light classification for effort difficulty, the workout is most suitable for the Beginner fitness level. The video is designed to be accessible for those seeking to manage stress and anxiety, making it particularly fitting for beginners. However, since breathing exercises can be relevant at all fitness levels for relaxation and stress management, it can modestly align with Intermediate and even Advanced users seeking a calming routine. This multi-level accessibility reflects in the required fitness level classification."
