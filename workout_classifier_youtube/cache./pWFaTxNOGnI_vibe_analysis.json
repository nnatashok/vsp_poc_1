  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled \"Breathing Exercises to Stop Panic Attack\" prominently focuses on utilizing gentle, guided breathing techniques to calm down, relieve anxiety, and combat stress, as indicated by the title and tags like 'calm breathing' and 'stress relief'. These features align well with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe due to the emphasis on nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement to achieve relaxation, which is central to the described breathing exercises. This is strengthened by the description's mention of 'calm down' and extending exhales for relaxation.\n\nMoreover, 'The Zen Flow' also applies due to the intentional, breath-centered nature of the workout, which matches the channel's focus on mindful breathwork and the video\u2019s guidance without musical accompaniment, creating an unhurried, grounding practice. The absence of music and emphasis on focusing on a 'breath bubble' further supports the Zen-like, meditative quality.\n\nThe scores reflect strong matches due to the explicit relaxation intention and slow, deliberate breath focus, but 'The Deep Recharge' scores slightly higher as the primary goal is calming a panic attack, embodying an ultra-gentle approach. No other vibes were significantly aligned with the video's content and purpose."
