  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Meditation' due to the strong emphasis on meditation throughout the metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'Meditation', and tags like 'meditation', 'guided meditation', 'mindfulness meditation', 'morning meditation' all point towards this category. The description and comments also suggest a focus on mental relaxation and mindfulness, typical of meditation practices. This warrants a high score of 0.95 for the 'Meditation' category. Additionally, there's a secondary presence of 'Breathing exercises', given indicators such as 'calm', and 'stress relief', which may involve breathing control to achieve these states, supporting a score of 0.6. Other potential categories are excluded due to the absence of physical activity-related terms and focus on the mental aspect of wellness."
