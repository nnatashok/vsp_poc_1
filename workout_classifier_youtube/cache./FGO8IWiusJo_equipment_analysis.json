  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video metadata indicates that the workout is a guided meditation session, which typically does not require any physical equipment. The title \"Guided Morning Meditation\" and tags such as \"meditation\" and \"mindfulness\" emphasize a mental practice rather than physical exertion or specific exercise equipment. The description further supports this by suggesting a quiet space to sit in stillness for meditation. There is no mention of any physical exercise, props, or equipment in the metadata that would suggest the need for items like mats or blocks used in physical yoga practices. Therefore, this workout appears to be bodyweight only, focusing purely on meditation and mindfulness."
