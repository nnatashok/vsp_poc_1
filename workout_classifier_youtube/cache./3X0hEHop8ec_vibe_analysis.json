  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized as a gentle, beginner-friendly 10-minute yoga class, indicating a calming and softly-paced experience, fitting for 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The description and tags emphasize terms like 'gentle', 'simple yoga stretch', and 'beginner yoga flow', suggesting a grounding, breath-centered practice consistent with Zen Flow's qualities. The use of foundational yoga poses and the emphasis on breathing deeply also align with this vibe. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong match between the workout's characteristics and Zen Flow.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of 'full body stretch', 'gentle on your body', and user comments referencing the session as a 'good morning starter' and 'gentle slow flow' align with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which focuses on low-stress, refreshing movement. The slightly lower score of 0.65 for Reboot indicates a moderate but clear match, as the primary focus is likely on relaxation and gentle movement rather than energizing revitalization. \n\nOther vibes were excluded due to lack of high intensity, fast pace, or specific technical skill focus mentioned in the video metadata."
