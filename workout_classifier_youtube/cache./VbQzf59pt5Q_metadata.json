    "I&#39;m 59 and I just finished my second week (3 workouts a week) and I&#39;m already seeing results and I have increased weights from when I started. This workout is perfect for me with my equipment at home. Also, wanted to let you know that posting these on YouTube is effective as I purchased your Ripped after 40 workout. And thanks for showing us what the perfect, natural physique looks like. You give me something to shoot for.",
    "I had a health setback that kept me from my usual workouts. Months later, when I went to start back, I didn\u2019t know where to begin. I saw your after 50 workout on YouTube, and since I\u2019m 62 I figured I\u2019d start here. I\u2019m thrilled that  I came across you, and this routine ... I feel like it\u2019s the  perfect way to get my workout \u201cgroove\u201d back again! Thanks so much!",
    "Efficient. Functional. Focused. As a dude born in the 60&#39;s, I appreciate the simplicity. Well done, brother, and thank you...",
    "I am 65 and go to the gym 6 days a week. It is an investment in my health which potentially could save me thousands of dollars in medical bills in the future. I think it is worth the time and energy to watch what you eat and do some form of cardio/resistance training daily."
