  "vibesExplanation": "The title and description of this workout explicitly focus on preparing for an easy delivery during the third trimester of pregnancy, highlighting gentle, supportive movements aimed at facilitating a positive birth experience. This aligns strongly with 'The Comfort Moves' vibe, which is about safe, feel-good movement, especially given the context of accommodating prenatal needs and encouraging comfort and safety during pregnancy exercises. The tags such as 'birth ball exercises' and 'pregnancy workout' further reinforce this gentle, supportive focus.\n\nAdditionally, the video has elements of 'The Reboot Workout' vibe due to its emphasis on deep stretch and total-body refresh in preparation for labor, as indicated by comments praising its efficacy in helping to achieve a head-down position for the baby and promoting a powerful and confident mental state for impending labor. The moderate to high score reflects the focus on relaxation and gentle movement as an aid to prepare for a physically demanding event like childbirth.\n\nAlternative vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Reboot Workout' were considered due to the restorative nature of the exercises, but the focus on comfort and safety makes 'The Comfort Moves' more fitting."
