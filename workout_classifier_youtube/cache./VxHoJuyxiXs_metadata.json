    "During my meditation today, I was guided to share this message: \u201cYou all hold and have an inner light, shining even in your darkest moments.\u00a0 Even in your saddest moments.\u00a0 That light, that divine spark within each and every one of you, shines like an eternal flame, never going out, just radiating your beautiful selves outwards.\u00a0 That light within you, is what you should nurture and tend to, feeding that light with hope, faith, positivity, love, joy, compassion, the list goes on. This light is your own sovereignty you hold within, and caring and nurturing that light is never selfish, it is what you must do, to fulfill your soul purpose. Stay in that alignment of light, allow it to burn steady and strong, unaffected by the winds of energy of all that surrounds you, only feel yourself shining bright, shining true, shining full of love.\u00a0 Strong and steady, you have the utmost spiritual support behind you.\u201d<br>During these times where we spend so much time at home, if you have a question, feel free to ask me by sending an email to natome44@gmail.com.\u00a0 Sending lots of love out to you all.",
