  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout, as described in the video metadata, is titled '30 MIN CARDIO PILATES || At-Home Full Body Workout,' strongly indicating a focus on bodyweight movements typical of Pilates. The description and tags emphasize at-home, full-body, and cardio Pilates without mentioning any specific equipment requirements. This suggests that the workout is designed to be accessible without the need for additional equipment, likely relying on bodyweight exercises which are common in Pilates routines. Furthermore, none of the top comments or other metadata references any specific equipment used in the workout. Therefore, we conclude with high confidence that no equipment is required for this workout, and it appears to be bodyweight only."
