  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Indoor biking' with a score of 1.0. This decision is strongly supported by repeated references to 'spin class,' 'indoor cycling,' and 'stationary bike workout' in the title, description, and tags. These terms clearly indicate the use of an indoor cycling machine as the workout's main focus.\n\nAdditionally, 'HIIT' is selected as a secondary category with a score of 0.7. The description mentions 'High Intensity,' and the workout includes elements like 'sprints' and 'jumps,' which are characteristic of HIIT workouts due to alternating periods of high-intensity effort and recovery. The mention of 'torch FAT' also aligns with calorie-burning goals typical of HIIT.\n\nOther categories such as 'Treadmill' or 'Yoga' were not considered relevant due to the specific focus on cycling and high-intensity elements rather than running or flexibility/mind-body practices."
