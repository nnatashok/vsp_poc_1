  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary classification of this workout video as \"Soothing & Restorative\" is based on the explicit focus on stress reduction and calmness conveyed by \"5-Minute Stress Buster\" in the title and the detailed description focusing on stress relief and mood stabilization through box breathing. The video is tailored for relaxation, emphasizing a quick reset and mood stabilization, which are key components of a restorative spirit. This strong emphasis is reflected in both the title and the comprehensive description, indicating high confidence in this classification, thus justifying a score of 0.9.\n\nA secondary spirit of \"Flow & Rhythm\" is considered due to the structured breathing pattern of \"breathe in, hold, breathe out, hold, and repeat,\" which suggests a rhythmic and repeating practice. The description highlights a smooth continuity in the breathing technique which aligns with elements of flow, although it's not explicitly music-driven or dance-like, leading to a moderate score of 0.4.\n\nOther spirits, such as \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Sport & Agility\", are excluded as there are no cues of vigorous activity or athletic performance within the metadata. The calm nature of the exercise and its restorative purpose lead to low confidence in these spirits. Overall, the classification confidence is high due to explicit cues in the metadata supporting the chosen spirits."
