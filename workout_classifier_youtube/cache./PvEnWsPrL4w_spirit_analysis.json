  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is classified mainly under 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.6 due to the title and description emphasizing 'beginner', 'fat burning', and 'home cardio', which suggests a planned, methodical approach to fitness suitable for beginners. The mention of 'take part at your own pace' in the description indicates a level of structure but with flexibility for individual progress. The presence of a specific instructor (Daniel) further implies a disciplined approach with guided progression.\n\nThe spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' was assigned a score of 0.59 because of the 'ALL standing' nature of the workout, suggesting a continuous, rhythmic movement pattern. While the title doesn't explicitly mention music, the home cardio format usually follows music-driven or rhythmic pacing, and the channel's description highlights 'excellent movement'.\n\n'Soothing & Restorative' receives a score of 0.4 given the low impact nature and the encouragement to 'pause whenever you have to', which emphasizes a gentle approach conducive to rest and recovery, especially for beginners.\n\nOverall, the video does not match 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Sport & Agility', or 'Outdoor & Adventure', as the workout is described as low impact and designed for a home setting without the intensity or specificity that characterizes those spirits."
