  "vibesExplanation": "The video strongly aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe due to its emphasis on 'insane' intensity, sweat-dripping effort, and primal energy elements that are typical of HIIT and heavy strength training. The title, 'Insane 30 Minute Treadmill Workout' and description emphasize high-intensity interval training as a fat-burning powerhouse. This is confirmed by user comments praising the workout's impact on fat loss and physical endurance. The score of 0.9 reflects the very high confidence in this classification.\n\n'Firestarter' was also chosen, scoring 0.7, due to the fast and explosive nature of sprint intervals included in the workout. The description outlines a structure of 30-second high-intensity sprints followed by low-intensity recovery phases, which are characteristic of short, intense HIIT sessions. However, it is a less dominant vibe than 'The Warrior Workout', resulting in a slightly lower score of 0.7."
