  "description": "Burning fat while sleeping? I know you're thinking it's impossible, but it's actually not! Our body is always burning fat. It's our body's way of keeping our involuntary system working.\n\nBurning fat is all about boosting your metabolism, and today's routines are great for this. This workout is a cardio and resistance training which helps ensure consistent muscle recovery throughout the night while you sleep.\n\nDo this workout every night before you sleep. Make sure to allot at least 2hrs before bedtime so you won't be too maxed out before bed. Good luck and let's get started!\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**If you want to be notified when I upload a new video, make sure to subscribe to our channel.

    "I\u2019m not even lying I did this for 1 week and I already notice changes . I feel so much fit than before and thinner than before thank you Roberta",
    "Dear Roberta,<br>I was really unhappy with my body and once I got to 70kg I said enough. I started doing some of your exercises and I saw a change. I kept on going and successfully lost 15kg in 4 months. Thank you so much for helping me on that journey!",
    "I love hearing rest time!!\ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\ude1d",
