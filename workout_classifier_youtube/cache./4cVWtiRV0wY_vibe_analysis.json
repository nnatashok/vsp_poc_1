  "vibesExplanation": "The workout focuses on managing intercostal muscle pain, which is evident from the title, description, and tags that frequently mention pain relief and specific exercises aimed at alleviating rib pain. The video length suggests a gentle routine, reinforcing the idea of a restorative workout rather than an intense one.\n\n'\"The Reboot Workout\"' is a strong fit (score 0.9) as the workout emphasizes pain management, recovery, and a total-body refresh approach, indicated by comments that describe significant relief and return to normal activities like golf.\n\n'\"The Foundation Builder\"' moderately fits (score 0.75) since the routine aims to strengthen weak points, such as the muscles around the ribs, aligning with the video\u2019s purpose of rebuilding after pain, supported by viewers' descriptions of improved strength and mobility.\n\nOther vibes like '\"The Zen Flow\"' or '\"The Deep Recharge\"' are less applicable because the focus isn't primarily on meditation or passive stretching, but more on active recovery and therapeutic movement."
