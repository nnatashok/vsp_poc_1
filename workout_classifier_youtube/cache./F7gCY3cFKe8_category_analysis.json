  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category identified for this workout is 'Breathing exercises' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is supported by the title, tags, and description which emphasize 'guided breathing' and the involvement of a 'breathing technique' specifically designed for relaxation and sleep aid (insomnia support). The channel's focus on 'Oxygen Advantage' further confirms an emphasis on breathing exercises.\n\n'Meditation' is the second category, with a score of 0.7, supported by references in the tags such as 'mindfulness practice' and in the comments mentioning 'yoganidra', a type of guided meditation. The calming and relaxation elements described in the video are typical of meditative practices.\n\nOther categories, such as 'Yoga', were not selected due to the lack of direct reference to physical postures or traditional yoga practices, despite the mention of 'yoganidra' by a commenter, which might suggest a meditative state typically associated with yoga techniques."
