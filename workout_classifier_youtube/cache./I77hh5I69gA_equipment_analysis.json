  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"Daily Pranayama under 15-Minutes | Breathing Exercises & Yoga\" is primarily focused on breath control exercises, commonly known as Pranayama, within the context of a yoga practice. The title, description, and tags emphasize breathing exercises and the practice of pranayama, which typically do not require any physical equipment beyond possibly a comfortable space to sit or lie down. There is no explicit mention of equipment such as mats or props in the metadata. Furthermore, comments from users suggest adaptations like doing the exercises \"on a chair\" if needed, but this is not a requirement for all participants. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the workout is designed to be performed using bodyweight only, without the need for any additional equipment."
