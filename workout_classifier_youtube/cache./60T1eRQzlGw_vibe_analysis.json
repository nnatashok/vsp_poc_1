  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled '25 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT || Energising Mat Pilates' from the 'Move With Nicole' channel is best classified with a primary vibe of 'The Meditative Grind' and 'The Zen Flow,' with a secondary consideration of 'The Groove Session.'\n\nThe vibe of 'The Meditative Grind' (score: 0.6) is supported by the nature of Pilates, which often involves repetitive, focused, and controlled movements, echoing the concept of zoning in and letting repetition take over. This is reinforced by the description emphasizing feeling 'strong and energised' and the sustained engagement over the video's 25-minute duration.\n\n'Zen Flow' (score: 0.6) is also applicable due to the calming, breath-centered nature of Pilates described in the channel's focus on movement that 'feels good for your body and soul,' which aligns with grounding and intentional movement practices.\n\nA minor vibe of 'The Groove Session' (score: 0.4) is considered as the channel has a background in dance, and the mention of feeling 'energised' and the use of music could imply an expressive quality to the workout.\n\nTags like 'feel good pilates' and 'intermediate pilates' suggest a slightly more fun and fluid approach, aligning with 'The Groove Session.' However, the emphasis on energy and feeling strong points more towards a balanced mix of meditative and flowing vibes rather than purely expressive."
