    "I did this workout yesterday, today I woke up feeling sore in my sides of my abs/torso - so I guess it\u2019s working \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\u2728",
    "Proud of myself for showing up and move my body today\u2026. Thank you Eleni for this amazing workout \u2764\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",
    "I appreciate you making + labeling vids specifically for no jumping and no squatting. It is very difficult for me to find accessible workout videos that I don\u2019t have to constantly modify. I hope one day soon I can build up the core connection to do the higher impact videos but these lower impact ones are absolutely necessary until then so I really commend you for catering to that demographic. And thank you for making them fun!\ud83d\ude0a",
    "such a good workout. not done much exercise in a while and am trying to get back in shape. this was definitely a great one to start off with. 245 calories down and the sweat is unreal!",
    "Thanks, Eleni! These standing abs, No jumping videos are my go-to\u2019s. Thank you for putting them out frequently. I really like that you change up your moves, but keep the moves similar. I appreciate that you challenge our balance. I\u2019d never do it on my own. I know it\u2019s important. Keep these videos coming. Thanks! \ud83d\udc96"
