    "For once, a trainer who walks you through step by step. This was really helpful, a real beginners guide. Thanks!",
    "Just found this exercise. I&#39;m a bit overweight, maybe 15 to 20 lbs, so i bought a pro-form 500 spx back in late june of this yr. Haven&#39;t ridden a bicycle in many yrs and this pro-form, well...i could ride it more. That standing position for me...WOW! I powered through this first try, but maybe I&#39;ll stay seated and just crank the resistance up 3 or 4 times on those parts instead (cranking is making me think i bought the wrong bike). It felt awkward, but maybe that&#39;s because i&#39;m on a bike that doesn&#39;t tilt, whereas a bicycle can. Eventually i&#39;ll go to your intermediate video. That said...great early morning start to my day!",
    "Hello I am 62 years old and have COPD and this beginners workout is perfect and it\u2019s making everything around my problem much stronger So I want to thank you so much have a healthy and happy life carol goode\ud83c\udf37",
    "I\u2019m only 9 And my dad is obsessed with working out! So he said get on the exercise bike and watch this vid while I\u2019m doing it This vid changed my life! Now my dad is proud of me! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!",
    "Omg you are amazing. I just purchased a spin bike and I haven\u2019t worked out in 6 months. You really gave a great workout in 10 minutes. I\u2019m going to do this for the rest of the week and then try something more advanced. Thanks"
