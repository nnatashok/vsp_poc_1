  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to multiple indicators in the title such as 'BEASTMODE' and 'Intense Strength Training', which suggest challenging and high-effort exercises. Tags like 'intense workout', 'muscle building', and 'advanced workout' further emphasize the vigorous nature of the session. Scoring a 0.9 reflects strong, explicit clues in the title and detailed description. \n\nThe second spirit, 'Structured & Disciplined', is indicated by the structured nature of exercises listed (e.g., RENEGATE ROWS x4, HEEL ELEVATED SQUATS x4), specified use of dumbbells with weight options, set timing (40 seconds work/20 seconds rest), and focus on major muscle groups with compound lifts, underscoring methodical progress. This spirit scores a 0.7 due to these clear, progressive elements in the workout format. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' and other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' have been excluded due to lack of relevant cues such as dance elements, relaxation, or nature interaction in the metadata. The combination of explicit and implicit evidence leads to a high confidence level for these classifications."
