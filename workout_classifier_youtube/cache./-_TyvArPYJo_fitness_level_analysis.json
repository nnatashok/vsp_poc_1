  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises listed, such as bicep curls, shoulder presses, and tricep extensions, are relatively simple and do not require advanced coordination or balance. These movements are foundational in strength training and can be performed with minimal technique difficulty. The inclusion of modifications, such as doing tricep dips on the floor, also indicates accessibility for various skill levels. Thus, the technique difficulty falls between Beginner and Intermediate, with slightly more alignment towards Intermediate due to recommended heavy lifting, which requires attention to form.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 33 minutes long and involves 12 exercises repeated twice, with 45 seconds of work and 30 seconds of rest. This structure, combined with the advice to lift heavy during the exercises, indicates a fairly demanding workout in terms of energy expenditure and physical exertion. While the exercises are traditional strength training movements, the consistent work and recommended weights suggest an effort level between Moderate and Challenging, leaning more towards Challenging due to the intensity implied by the instruction to 'push outside of your comfort zone.'",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the technique and effort levels, the required fitness level ranges from Beginner to Advanced. Beginners can attempt this workout with lighter weights, while intermediate users are likely to find it more appropriately challenging. Advanced users may also find the workout beneficial if they push the weight limit or reduce rest periods. The instructional guidance to select weights that challenge the user towards the end of each work interval underscores its applicability to Intermediate and Advanced levels, though modifications and the basic nature of the exercises provide some accessibility for determined beginners."
