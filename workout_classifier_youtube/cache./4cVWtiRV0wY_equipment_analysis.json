  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video focuses on a routine for managing intercostal muscle pain, as suggested by the title and description. There is no mention of any specific equipment in the title, description, or tags, and the comments reflect results based on stretches and exercises aimed at relief without indicating any equipment usage. Additionally, the context of pain relief and recovery from intercostal strain suggests bodyweight movements, stretches, and potentially breathing exercises, which typically do not require equipment. Therefore, it is concluded with high confidence that the routine is bodyweight only, requiring no equipment."
