  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for this breathing exercise is rated as 'Beginner' due to the simplicity of the movements involved, which are primarily focused on breathing in a controlled, diaphragmatic manner. These movements require minimal coordination and no special skills. The exercise involves lying on your back, a stable and comfortable position, which reduces complexity and balance demands. The instruction to breathe lightly, slowly, and deeply is straightforward, although the detailed focus on diaphragmatic expansion could introduce a minor complexity, justifying a slight inclusion of 'Intermediate' for those unfamiliar with diaphragmatic breathing.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as 'Light' due to the nature of the exercise focusing on controlled breathing rather than physical exertion. With a duration of just over 9 minutes and the primary activity being deep breathing while lying down, the energy expenditure and physical demand are minimal. The tags and description emphasize relaxation and anxiety relief over physical effort, confirming the low effort requirement of the workout.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is predominantly 'Beginner' since the exercise involves simple, guided breathing appropriate for individuals new to fitness or exercise. The inclusion of 'Intermediate' is justified marginally as individuals with very low body awareness might find diaphragmatic focus slightly novel, and the exercise does include some elements of guided control which may not be intuitive to absolute beginners. The exercise requires no significant physical fitness, aligning closely with a beginner audience, while the slight complexity of diaphragmatic breathing allows a broader base to benefit, hence the minor intermediate aspect."
