  "channelDescription": "Hypnosis | Hypnotherapy | Sleep Hypnosis | Guided Meditation\n\nHi, my name is Michael and welcome to my channel, where I hope you can stop by to relax, listen in, and see for yourself the power of positive hypnosis.\n\nHypnosis is a completely natural state of often deeply felt relaxation and focused attention, where positive suggestions can be more easily accepted by our subconscious minds. Imagine a fantastic and tranquil state of daydreaming, and that is very close to hypnosis!  \n\nHypnosis can bring us improved self control, clearer and empowered behavioural choices, and allow us to listen to our best inner resources. Many people experience a deep sense of calmness and serenity during hypnotic meditation and are often pleasantly surprised to see the ongoing, life enhancing results. \n\nThank you greatly for your support, feel free to subscribe and comment on your great results, and I trust you will benefit from your time spent with positive hypnosis.\n\nPeace & Enjoy",

    "Michael, <br>I am a 25 year old recovering heroin/fentanyl/coke addict, and have ADD, and clinical depression. For the last 6 months I have been doing on average one of your videos 5-7 times a week for the past few months.<br><br>It has been a HUGE help keeping me motivated and learning about how powerful my mind and body are together when I become more self aware. And thats what your videos and guidance has been helping me get better at.<br><br>I really enjoy your meditations and hypnosis&#39;, they are really really such a big part of why I am able to make it through C19 isolation by myself with no friends or family near by. <br><br>Much love! I think you are amazing, and wish that I could show you my appreciation some day.<br><br>Thanks :)",
    "I\u2019ve tried to listen to other voices during my meditation sessions but I always find my way back to you, Michael. Thank you for guiding me through my never ending transformation of remembering who I am. It\u2019s beautiful and intimate. Let\u2019s awaken the species!",
    "I\u2019ve been listening to this channel for 10 years. There was a time Micheal\u2019s voice was the only calming and comforting voice I would get for years. Almost became like this pseudo grandfather I could go back to who would always tell me words of encouragement and tell me I\u2019m enough. Seriously saved my life. Thank you Micheal for your years of service.",
    "Michael - Please know my deep appreciation and gratitude for your gifts, talents and generosity.  I have adopted your meditations as part of my daily routine for some time now and, having listened to so many, so frequently and over time, would like to offer you this sincere compliment:  I have noticed a subtle but marked improvement with each new meditation.  The authenticity and natural flow of your voice, quality of content and art of visualization is notable.  Your effectiveness, impact and influence keeps me coming back and eager for more. You have a true gift and I thank you for your contributions to empowering mySelf and so many others.  Blessings as your journey continues.  Namaste.",
    "My top search on YouTube is always Michael Sealey. His voice is so soothing. Thank you so much for helping to bring balance to my body. \u2764"
