    "I just finished it. I was too lazy to get out of bed and exercise but this workout felt great. I&#39;m going to do this every night. I felt the burn lmao.",
    "I have Vertigo, and exercising is very difficult. So today that I&#39;m feeling a little better I tried this and I&#39;ll be definitely be doing this every day.",
    "I&#39;ve been doing this for months now and honestly, it&#39;s amazing. I did lose some weight and my body became so much more active, I feel way healthier. I do this every morning in bed and I&#39;ve noticed changes in my body. Some tips though, you should take longer breaks, just pause the video, don&#39;t force yourself too much. And when they say repeat 20 times for each leg, you go 10 times this one, 10 times the other, come back to this one then 10 times the other to finish. Don&#39;t go 20 times a leg(in one go) if you can&#39;t! One important thing, I believe in you and you will make it!"
