  "description": "The natural frequency of 432Hz, also called the\u201cEarth frequency\u201d, is the frequency everything in our Universe resonates with. This specially composed music for meditation and/or sleep in the healing frequency of 432 Hz is here for you to lovingly help you to let go of all blockages, reset your mind, body and soul and find back to inner balance and deep inner peace.\n\nYou can buy & download the original full length track here:\nhttps://innerlotusmusic.com/a/s/wtqgqv\n\nVisit the Inner Lotus Music Store:\nhttps://innerlotusmusic.com/\n\n\nStream the single edit on: \n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/1sbiGdXC71zHd7D7A2293f\nAmazon Music: https://amazon.com/music/player/tracks/B0D2J86K8J\nOther streaming platforms: https://linktr.ee/innerlotusmusic\n\n\nIf you enjoy my music and would like to support me, you are welcome to subscribe to my channel \ud83e\udd17 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/@innerlotusmusic?sub_confirmation=1 \nHit the ((\ud83d\udd14)) to turn on notifications and receive the latest Inner Lotus Music!   \n\n\nThe natural frequency of 432Hz, also called the\u201cEarth frequency\u201d, is the frequency everything in our Universe resonates with. Music tuned to 432 Hz is proven to be relaxing for body and mind and very often also perceived as being more harmonic and pleasant than the \u201cstandard\u201d 440 Hz, which is the frequency that most of the modern day music we listen to is tuned at. \n\nMusic tuned to 432 Hz is often perceived as being softer and more pleasant. It is said to provide greater clarity and is easier on the ears. In short, 432 Hz music can fill the mind with a sense of deep peace and well-being, while releasing emotional blockages that hinder us from letting go and experiencing full inner and outer harmony.\u00a0 \n\nThe frequency of 111Hz, also known as \u201cdivine frequency\u201d is said to be a \u201choly\u201d frequency, allowing deepest states of meditation and connecting to higher spheres of consciousness. According to scientific reports, MRI scans have shown that - when listening to 111 Hz - our brain reduces prefrontal cortex activity and slows down the so-called \u201clanguage center\u201d, inducing a phase at exactly 111 Hz. This reaction results in a divine level of meditation. A state of trance that is said to allow connection with the universe, or a spiritual guide.\n\n\nIf you enjoy this video, you might also resonate with the following 432Hz music:\n\n432Hz + 111Hz Energetic Cleanse & Spiritual Healing Frequency | Flute, Bowls & Rain Meditation Music\nhttps://youtu.be/Eaq9vskuvWI\n\nKundalini Awakening | 111Hz + 432Hz Rising of the Goddess Within | Yoga, Energy & Meditation Music\nhttps://youtu.be/xHJHje069UQ\n\nHealing Calm & Deep Inner Peace | Release All Blockages | 432 Hz Spiritual Meditation & Sleep Music\nhttps://youtu.be/dKdeOdxl0UQ\n\nAnd if you would like to discover more music written in the natural Earth frequency of 432Hz, you can find it in this playlist:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXwfGygOmeUXtiuasFbNoSNUJOt9ibMvy\n\n\nFor this meditation and/or sleep music, all instruments have been specifically and carefully tuned to 432 Hz and 111Hz. Therefore, the music in this video is an original 432Hz + 111Hz composition and has not been artificially tuned to these frequencies after completion. I am convinced that composing music in the original frequency will lead to better results when it comes to deploying the positive energy and benefits of these particular natural frequencies. \n\nFeel free to listen to this meditation and/or sleep music with headphones at a moderate level or - if you prefer - just let it flow through open space. As long as it is positive for your body and soul, it will be positive for you. \n\nLove and gratitude \ud83e\udde1\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc \nPierre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Do not listen to music emphasizing particular frequencies if you suffer from epilepsy!
