  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'The Warrior Workout' with a score of 0.8 due to its intense and demanding nature, as indicated by tags such as 'high intensity cardio' and 'fat burning hiit workout'. The description emphasizes a mix of high-intensity strength and plyometric movements, typical of warrior vibes with primal energy. Comments from users mention the workout's lack of verbal encouragement and structured nature, allowing for a disciplined and focused experience, further reinforcing this classification.\n\n'The Firestarter' is also identified with a score of 0.7 because of the fast, explosive elements of the workout, as suggested by the 20-minute duration and high-intensity focus. Although the session extends beyond typical Firestarter lengths, the no-repeat, rapid succession of exercises aligns with an explosive and devastating vibe. The user's ability to include modifications suggests adaptability in intensity, capturing elements of a Firestarter. The absence of intricate, dance-like experiences excludes 'The Nightclub Workout' or 'The Groove Session' as potential vibes."
