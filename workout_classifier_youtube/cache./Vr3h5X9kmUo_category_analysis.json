  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified as 'Yoga' with a strong explicit indicator found in both the title and tags, such as 'morning yoga', 'vinyasa yoga', and 'yoga 15 minutes'. The channel description also notes Nicole as a Certified Yoga Instructor, confirming a focus on yoga-related content. The description promotes feeling 'balanced, energised' which are typical outcomes from yoga practice, justifying the high score. \n\n'Yoga' scores a 1.0, reflecting its definitive presence as a core element of the video's content. \n\nAdditionally, the secondary focus on 'Stretching' is evident in tags like '15 minute stretch' and 'morning stretch yoga', suggesting some overlap with flexibility training. This aspect is assigned a moderate score of 0.5 due to its supportive, though not central, role in the yoga flow. \n\nThe high view count and positive comments further reinforce the assumption that this video effectively serves its primary purpose as a yoga session."
