  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video in question is a guided meditation for anxiety and stress. The title, description, and tags strongly suggest that this is a meditation and relaxation video focused on guided imagery and visualization. There is no mention of physical exercises or equipment such as mats, dumbbells, or any other gym equipment. The description emphasizes better sleep, peace, and relaxation rather than a physical workout. Additionally, the channel's focus is on meditation and sleep music, which further supports the conclusion that no physical workout equipment is required. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, without the need for any specific equipment."
