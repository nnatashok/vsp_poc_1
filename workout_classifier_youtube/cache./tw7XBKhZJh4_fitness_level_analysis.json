The metadata, including the title, description, and comments, indicate that it involves basic mindfulness practices, which are generally straightforward and do not require sophisticated physical movements or coordination.

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.95,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is predominantly Beginner, as the meditation involves no physical fitness prerequisites and is accessible to all deconditioned users. However, because mindfulness might require some mental discipline and experience in focusing attention, a mild score for Intermediate is also justified. This inclusion recognizes users who may be new to mindfulness but seek a more thoughtful engagement. The simplicity and absence of physical demands strongly anchor it to the Beginner level."
