    "This program is amazing! I just finished going through your entire playlist for the first time, and now I\u2019m on my second round. I can already see major improvements\u2014when I started, I could barely do one push-up without needing assistance. Now it\u2019s the complete opposite\u2014I don\u2019t even need to do assisted push-ups anymore! Lastly I\u2019m from USA in the state of Arizona.",
    "My husband and I discovered you last month! We are currently on day 12 of the Calisthenics workout, but also doing bands, kettlebell, dumbell workouts too. We are loving it! You are so refreshing compared to other trainers that waffle on about themselves for 10 mins before cracking on with the workout. You get straight to the point! We are combining with a low cal high protein diet- and we have both lost weight and feel wonderful already! Im 48 and hubby is 56 and we are so glad we discovered you! Thanks Tom! We are in Bradford, England.",
    "I&#39;ve been searching for a proper callisthenics beginner&#39;s video and I landed here. Tomorrow morning will be my first day after a few months of inactivity. I need to get back on that horse and your video is simply perfect! Thank you for taking the time to make these day-to-day workouts. God bless you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udf3b",
    "After trying several online workout coaches, my son (who is 27) and myself (60!) came across your workouts and instantly knew your style of coaching was right for us. Love your no nonsense approach, clear demonstration of the exercises and no time wasting before, during and after the workouts. Excellent instruction! We&#39;re in South Wales, UK and have been doing your YouTube workouts for several months and just finished day 1 of your Calisthenics series. Thank you and keep up the good work :)",
    "I came across this video by accident while scrolling through YT, and I thought, &#39;Yeah, even youtube is telling me to get up from the couch.&#39; This is my first challenge like this. I hope I find the strength to complete it all. The first workout made me sweat \ud83d\ude05"
