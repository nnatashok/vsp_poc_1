  "categoriesExplanation": "The category 'Yoga' was chosen due to multiple strong indicators present in the metadata. The title explicitly states the video content as a '45 Min Yoga Routine,' which is directly aligned with the Yoga category. The description further emphasizes that this is a 'full body yoga routine' featuring specific yoga elements such as 'vinyasa flow with sun salutations, hip openers, backbends, standing balances and twists.' These terms are specific to yoga practices, particularly vinyasa yoga, which is a flowing sequence of poses. The channel information reinforces this classification as it is dedicated to yoga content, and the channel owner, Charlie, is described as a 'certified Yoga Teacher' focusing on 'vinyasa yoga and functional anatomy.' Top comments support the video's alignment with yoga, with users mentioning their regular practice of yoga and improvements attributed to the sessions. There are no indicators suggesting other workout categories. Consequently, 'Yoga' is the central defining feature, justifying a high score of 0.95 and high confidence of 0.95 in this classification."
