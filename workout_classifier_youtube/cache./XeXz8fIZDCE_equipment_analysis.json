  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Yoga For Lower Back Pain | Yoga With Adriene' strongly suggests the need for a 'Mat' due to the nature of yoga practices. The description states that this is a yoga sequence for lower back pain, which typically involves exercises performed on the floor. Yoga practices commonly require a mat for comfort and to prevent slipping during poses. Additionally, the mention of yoga in tags such as 'yoga for lower back pain' and 'yoga at home' further supports the high likelihood that a mat is necessary. Therefore, the confidence score for a mat is 0.9, given its crucial role in providing a stable and comfortable surface for yoga practices."
