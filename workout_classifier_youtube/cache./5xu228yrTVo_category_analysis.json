  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as a 'Body weight' workout with a very high confidence level (score: 0.9) due to explicit mentions in the metadata. The title '10 Minute Body Weight Workout' directly indicates the use of body weight as resistance. Tags such as 'body weight workout', 'plank', 'calf raises', and 'lunge' reinforce this classification, suggesting exercises typical of body weight training. The description mentions 'build lean muscle', consistent with body weight training practices that improve muscle tone and endurance.\n\nThe secondary classification as 'Other' with a low score (0.1) accounts for any additional, unspecified elements not fitting neatly into typical body weight workout categories. \n\nComments support the categorization, indicating simple, manageable exercises that suggest a body weight focus, ideal for beginners or a quick workout routine. The channel focuses on wellness and health, aligning with offering a general body weight workout without technical equipment requirements. Therefore, no other specific category fits as closely based on the provided metadata."
