    "I\u2019ve just ended a 3 hour panic attack doing this. Absolutely magic",
    "Does anyone else have a panic attack where you feel like you are unable to swallow, then you go like you are about to pass out and no matter how hard you try to think positive you just get worse and worse and then after it you are just emotionally and physically drained or is it just me !! It&#39;s absolutely terrifying I don&#39;t know how much I can take I feel so alone",
    "I hope you get better as soon as possible. You are not alone. I had many terrible attacks and know they are so hard to deal with. I don&#39;t know the secret to stop a panic attack, but i know how to lower the chances of getting one.<br>Try to sleep well at night, without using too much phone with <br>bright lights next to sleep time. Try to eat the healthier you can. And avoid bad thoughts, bad people and bad feelings. Be close to people that you love and that live a balanced and healthy life.<br>Don&#39;t keep hatred, anger, inside your mind. They don&#39;t hurt those who made us suffer<br>they only hurt ourselves. And if you can&#39;t do any of these, just try to be the best version of yourself. That is always appreciated and it is enough. Most importantly, stay alive. WHEN THERE IS LIFE, THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE FOR CHANGE. Time passes and so much changes with it. TIME is one of the most powerful things that exist in our human life. Let&#39;s stay alive, we don&#39;t know how the future is going to be.",
