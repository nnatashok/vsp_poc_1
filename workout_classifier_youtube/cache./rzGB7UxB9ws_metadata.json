    "My mom has a back pain for 7 months and it is getting worse when the pain runs to her legs. I sent her your video and after 3 days, doing this twice per day, she told me the pain had been released and it really worked.",
    "I have the worst lower back pain I\u2019ve ever had, and this gave me so much relief. Second day doing it, thank you",
    "im only 17 but dealing with some unbearable back pain and this made me finally feel well, thanks!",
    "I&#39;m 23...I never really thought I was out of shape or my body was aging beyond my years, but good GOD I&#39;m more out of shape than I thought. This was harder and more painful than any workout I could do at the gym. I have such terrible tightness in my hamstrings and groin-pelvic muscles, I couldn&#39;t even go half as far as you did in the video. Looks like I&#39;ll need to keep this up for a while, lol."
