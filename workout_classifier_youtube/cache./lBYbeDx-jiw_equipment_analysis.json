  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"5 Minute Morning Yoga - Daily Stretching Routine\" from the channel \"Yoga with Kassandra\" does not require any equipment for the workout. The description explicitly states \"No props needed and suitable for all levels,\" indicating that this routine is designed to be performed without any additional equipment. The tags and description emphasize yoga poses like \"ragdoll, temple pose, wide legged forward fold and downward facing dog,\" which are typically bodyweight exercises that do not necessitate props or equipment like mats, blocks, or straps for execution. Thus, the workout appears to be designed to be performed without any equipment, hence the empty list for required equipment."
