The lack of equipment suggests movements are predominantly basic bodyweight exercises, which generally fall under beginner level in terms of technique. The inclusion of various body parts implies a mixture of simple exercises like squats, lunges, and push-ups. User comments indicate it can be engaging even if challenging, implying accessible movements with possible intermediate applications.",
