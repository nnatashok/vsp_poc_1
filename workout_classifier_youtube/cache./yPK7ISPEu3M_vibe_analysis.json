  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is \"The Zen Flow,\" as evidenced by the title and overall description emphasizing a \"15 Min Daily Yoga Flow\" and \"full body practice you can do every day.\" The use of terms like \"easy to follow,\" \"complete practice,\" and the channel's focus on yoga reinforces a grounding, intentional, breath-centered experience which is a key characteristic of the Zen Flow vibe (Score: 0.8).\n\n\"The Groove Session\" is a secondary vibe with moderate confidence. The description mentions Charlie's \"signature playful style of vinyasa flow,\" and the positive, joyful experience described in the comments aligns with the expressive and fluid qualities of this vibe (Score: 0.5).\n\nAdditionally, \"The Reboot Workout\" is relevant considering the comments about the class being refreshing and a good start to the day. The mention of the class helping individuals with previous injuries also supports the concept of a low-stress, refreshing workout (Score: 0.4).\n\nOther potential vibes like \"The Meditative Grind\" or \"The Endorphin Wave\" were excluded due to the lack of emphasis on repetition or an intense energy build, which are not evident in the video's description or comments."
