  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.9. This is evidenced by the description of the workout as a 'pilates challenge' and user comments highlighting smooth, elegant movements. Pilates often emphasizes coordination and a strong mind-body connection, which fits the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit very well. \n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit was assigned a score of 0.7 due to the presence of a '7-DAY pilates challenge', implying a progressive structure and commitment sequence designed to yield noticeable physical changes. Comments from users indicate adherence to a routine and noticeable progress over time, aligning with a structured approach.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit received a score of 0.6 because users described the workout as 'calm' and 'a feel-good pill', indicating that it helps in relaxation and recovery, although not as explicitly focused as 'Flow & Rhythm'.\n\nOther potential spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense', were excluded because the workout is described as slower-paced and not primarily focused on maximal effort or intensity."
