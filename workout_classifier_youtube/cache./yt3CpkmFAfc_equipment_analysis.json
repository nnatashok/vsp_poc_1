  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is a series of neck and shoulder exercises described as being performed while sitting and using a chair for support. Specifically, exercises 4, 5, and 6 involve grasping or holding the chair, which is crucial for performing the stretches correctly and comfortably. The description clearly mentions using a chair to help fix the shoulder or grasp under the seat, making it an essential component of these exercises. Therefore, the confidence level for the chair is very high at 1.0, as it is explicitly mentioned and central to multiple exercises in the routine."
