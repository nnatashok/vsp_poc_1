    "I can\u2019t believe I just did a \u201cCalisthenics\u201d workout, even if at a beginner level. Calisthenics is so cool but so intimidating. Thanks for making it accessible. This was so fun. :\u2019)",
    "that \u201cgood job\u201d after those superman lifts brought me back to reality \ud83d\ude2d I was DYING",
    "This was a great beginner workout.  I am 53 yrs old and have had several significant injuries the past. 2 yrs.  I was able to do almost all of the sets, except I cannot have my head down for a long period of time.  It gives me a migraine.  I need to get stronger and I think this routine will help me.  Now I just have to stay motivated.  Thank you",
    "This is so helpful and unpretentious. The other YouTubers I checked out were showing off what they can do, rather than teaching. Thank you so much for this! \ud83d\udc97"
