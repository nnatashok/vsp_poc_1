  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned to this workout is 'Calisthenics,' with a score of 1.0. This is based on explicit mentions in the title ('10 MIN Full Body Calisthenics Workout For Beginners'), tags (e.g., 'Calisthenics Exercises,' 'basic calisthenics'), and the description ('... help you learn the sport I love...'). Calisthenics is the central focus of the workout, involving exercises typical to this form like pull-ups and dips as detailed in the top comments.\n\nThe 'Body weight' category is also relevant, with a score of 0.7. The workout involves exercises such as pull-ups and push-ups, which are classic body weight exercises. The emphasis in the video on not requiring equipment further suggests a significant element of body weight training.\n\nThe confidence level is high (0.9) due to strong evidence supporting these categories. Other categories like 'Weight workout' are excluded as the video emphasizes exercises without weights and focuses on bodyweight strength and calisthenic discipline."
