  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"20 Minute Guided Meditation for Anxiety: Quiet the Busy Mind | Mindful Movement\" clearly focuses on meditation and mindfulness practices rather than physical exercise. The description mentions activities such as \"guided mindfulness meditation,\" \"focused breath practice,\" and \"body scan,\" all of which indicate that the primary activity involves sitting or lying down comfortably while following verbal guidance. There are no mentions of physical exercise or specific equipment requirements in the title, description, or tags. Comments also emphasize the mental and emotional benefits without any references to physical activity or equipment. Therefore, it appears that no equipment is needed for this meditation session, and the session can be performed as a bodyweight-only activity in a quiet space conducive to relaxation and mindfulness."
