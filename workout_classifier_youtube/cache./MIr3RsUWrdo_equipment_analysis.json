  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"20 Minute Guided Meditation for Reducing Anxiety and Stress--Clear the Clutter to Calm Down\" is focused on guided meditation aimed at reducing stress and anxiety through relaxation techniques. The provided metadata, including the title, description, and tags, emphasizes meditation, relaxation, and mindfulness but makes no mention of any physical exercise or equipment. There are no explicit references to any type of fitness equipment such as mats or yoga props that might be occasionally used for comfort during meditation. All indicators suggest this is a purely mental and relaxation exercise with no physical components, thereby requiring no equipment. The absence of any equipment-related mentions suggests the workout is bodyweight only, with mediation being the primary focus."
