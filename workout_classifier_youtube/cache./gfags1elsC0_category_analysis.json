  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Pilates' with a high score of 0.95. This conclusion is drawn directly from the title, which explicitly mentions 'pilates workout,' and the channel description, which confirms the creator is a certified Pilates instructor. Additionally, several comments reference the effectiveness of Pilates, reinforcing that this is the main focus of the workout.\n\nThe 'Mat' category receives a score of 0.7 due to the workout being described as a 'full body' session without equipment, implying exercises are conducted on a mat. This classification is further supported by the channel's focus on at-home workouts, which typically involve mat exercises.\n\nLastly, 'Stretching' is rated at 0.5. A comment specifically mentions stretches included at the end, suggesting that while not the primary focus, it forms a significant part of the routine, possibly as a cool-down or mobility session. Overall, the metadata supports a confident classification into these categories, primarily centered on Pilates with mat work aspects and stretching."
