  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary classification of this video as 'Meditation' is strongly supported by the title, tags, and channel information. The title 'Guided Meditation for Lucid Dreaming' and tags such as 'guided meditation for lucid dreaming' and 'lucid dreaming guided meditation' indicate a focus on meditation techniques aimed at achieving a state of mindfulness while dreaming. Additionally, the description explicitly states that this guided meditation aims to help with lucid dreaming, reinforcing the central role of meditation in the content. The high engagement and positive responses in the comments also illustrate the effectiveness of the meditation for users, with references to relaxation and focused mindfulness practices typically associated with meditation. \n\nThe secondary category 'Breathing exercises' is given a much lower score of 0.2 due to the limited information available that specifically relates to structured breathing techniques. Although relaxation is mentioned in the comments and description, it does not explicitly cite breathing exercises as a component. Instead, the focus remains on meditation, suggesting that breathing may be a minor component or implied within the meditation guidance without explicit reference. Overall, the data suggests a high confidence level for categorizing this video under 'Meditation' with a possibility of minor elements of breathing techniques."
