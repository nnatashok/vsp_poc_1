  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Meditation' with a score of 1.0. This classification is supported by multiple strong indicators: the title prominently includes 'Guided Meditation', and the description mentions it as a meditation session aimed at cultivating positivity, gratitude, and joy. Additionally, the tags are heavily centered around meditation concepts such as 'guided meditation', 'meditation for positivity', and 'morning meditation'. These elements clearly establish that the video is focused on meditation practices.\n\nA secondary category of 'Breathing exercises' is suggested with a score of 0.5. Although the video is primarily meditation-focused, meditation often involves controlled breathing exercises. However, since there is no direct mention of breathing techniques in the metadata, the confidence in this secondary category is moderate.\n\nNo other categories are relevant, as there is no indication of physical exercise, yoga, or other workout modalities. The content and channel focus reinforce the meditation intent, ruling out other potential classifications."
