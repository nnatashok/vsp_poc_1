  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title of the video explicitly identifies it as a 'Yoga Workout,' which typically requires a mat for comfort and support during floor exercises and poses. The description provides further confirmation, as it mentions a 'Mat from Liforme,' and offers a discount code for purchasing it, strongly implying its necessity. These elements justify a very high confidence level (1.0) in the requirement of a mat for conducting this workout. Other commonly associated yoga equipment, such as blocks or straps, were not mentioned in the metadata, so no additional equipment is identified."
