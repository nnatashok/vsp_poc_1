  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of this workout is 'The Zen Flow' with a high confidence score of 0.9. The workout is focused on grounding, intentional, and breath-centered yoga practice, as indicated by phrases like 'promote healthy flow of energy,' 'Find What Feels Good,' and the emphasis on setting a calming tone for the day. The channel Yoga With Adriene is known for inclusive, slow-paced, calming yoga practices, reinforcing this classification.\n\nThe vibe 'The Reboot Workout' was also assigned with a score of 0.7. This is due to the video's short duration and focus on refreshing and renewing one's energy in the morning, which aligns with a low-stress, total-body refresh goal.\n\nLastly, 'The Endorphin Wave' scored 0.5 because, although the workout is calm, comments suggest participants feel elevated energy and a positive emotional impact after completing it, albeit in a gentle format. The short duration and pleasant experience slightly align with the steady energy build characteristic of this vibe.\n\nOther vibes were excluded as they did not match the calm and gentle nature of the yoga practice, which focuses on connection and mindfulness rather than intensity or competition."
