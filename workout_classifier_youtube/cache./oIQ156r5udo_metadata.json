However to get fat loss results I recommend the following:\n1. Being in calorie deficit\n2. Cardio/ HIIT workout (I often call these Fat Loss/Burn workouts on my channel)\n3. Resistance training and specific muscle targeted workouts. To strengthen and develop specific muscles.\nI have hundreds of other home workouts available on my channel, so you can pick and choose which workouts you want to do, to not only make you build a strong body, but also feel amazing.\nPlease remember every body is different and we all progress at different rates. The fact that you have shown up and completed this workout is incredible. You should be very proud of yourself for taking the steps to improve not only your physical, but also your mental health.\nThe key to achieving your fitness and health goals is consistency and healthy lifestyle changes, without restriction. I don\u2019t believe in crazy fad diets. Simply eat nutritious food, move your body, smile and enjoy the journey! Love Lilly",

    "wowza- I discovered Lilly a few weeks ago... I am 5 months postpartum, and hit my pre-pregnancy weight at 4 months. I&#39;ve lost an additional 4 pounds in the past month, and I&#39;ve noticed a huge difference in my waistline over the past few weeks! Literally, my pre-pregnancy jeans were tight one week and loose the next. I actually thought I would never lose that slight mommy pooch and just accepted it as part of my new reality...but its completely gone. Lilly&#39;s workouts are effective!  <b>*disclaimer*</b> 1) I gave myself 6 weeks postpartum to heal, with just walking, and rebuilt my core strength over the next few months with Lauren Tiffer&#39;s &quot;Lose your mommy pooch plan&quot;- this gave me the foundation I needed to do these regular type workouts again. 2) I am breastfeeding (helps some and hinders others to lose weight) 3) I also run for 30 mins 3-4 times/week, and walk for 40 mins at least twice a week. Anyhow, these workouts are MAGIC!! :)",
    "My hands are shaking after this workout\ud83d\ude2dthe burn was wayyy too fire\ud83d\udd25 in the beginning..<br>Gotta love Lilly for providing us free amazing pilates workouts\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96",
    "I&#39;ve never completed a pilates workout in my life this is the only one I could finish until the end I&#39;m so proud of myself rn I&#39;m keep doing it thank u so much for this amazing workout, ok so I&#39;m on my 2nd day and I&#39;ve seen changes in my abs they are more toned and my inner thigh  looked a bit slimmer too",
    "There is a total of 3 minutes of core in this, which at first was a little upsetting because my legs were toast from a previous days workout, so the lower body focus was like \ud83d\ude2d BUT those 3 minutes or core left me sore the next day. Lilly is a wizard \ud83e\ude84 I&#39;m calling it\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc\u2665\ufe0f my fiance said this morning, &quot;I see you do a workout with no weights and I&#39;m like, wtf. And then the next day you&#39;re sore.&quot; Body weight exercises are grossly underrated \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc"
