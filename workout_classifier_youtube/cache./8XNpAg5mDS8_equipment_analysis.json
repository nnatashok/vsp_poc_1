  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a 25-minute full body stretching routine focusing on relaxation, flexibility, and stress relief, fitting the typical characteristics of a mat-based workout. In the description, the creator mentions \"THE MAT I USE (Exercise 6X4)\" with an affiliate link, clearly indicating a recommendation for viewers to use a mat during the routine. This aligns with the inclusion of the #Yoga and #Stretch tags, suggesting exercises typically performed on a mat. Additionally, the comments reflect users engaging in the workout with a mat, as seen in the comment \"I'm already on my mat and super excited for a new stretching routine.\" This provides a very high confidence that a mat is required for this workout."
