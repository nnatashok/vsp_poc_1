  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout is classified as primarily \"High-Energy & Intense\" due to the descriptors like \"short and sweet,\" \"big efforts,\" and \"cadence drills at over 100 rpm\" found in the description and comments. The mention of \"intervals,\" \"HIIT,\" and phrases like \"legs are dying\" and \"what a burner!\" from user comments further reinforce this classification. The structured breakdown of specific cadence and intensity levels in the description indicates a \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit. The precise time allocations and RPM targets suggest a methodical approach to cycling training. The use of \"training\" and \"workout\" in both tags and description support these selections, confirming the rigorous and disciplined nature of the video, leading to scores of 0.9 and 0.8, respectively, for these spirits. \"Flow & Rhythm\" is less emphasized due to the focus on high intensity and structured intervals rather than continuous, smooth movement. Therefore, it is excluded from the primary classifications."
