    "I couldn&#39;t do this without you, Rachel!! You&#39;re funny which keeps me entertained. And you offer good encouragement, which I also need. I want to be able to run comfortably but my brain whines that it is endless if I go past 1 minute\ud83d\ude05. Your &quot;running&quot;(pun intended)  commentary keeps me going! Thank you very very much!",
