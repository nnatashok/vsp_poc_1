  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as a 'Total Body Strength Workout,' which implies the use of compound movements typical in strength training. The inclusion of dumbbells and the mention of technique modifications by the instructor suggest an intermediate level of complexity. The comments also indicate that modifications are explained throughout, indicating the exercises are likely structured such that they can accommodate varied skill levels. There is potential for advanced techniques given the 'Core Burnout' aspect, which hints at exercises requiring some core stabilization skills.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 40 minutes long and involves strength training, typically a more physically demanding category of exercise. The use of terms like 'Core Burnout' and 'Total Body' implies a focus on high energy expenditure and comprehensive engagement of muscle groups. The comments suggest a continuous and intense workout as users mention their heart rate remained elevated. This indicates that the workout is challenging, further supported by the use of adjustable dumbbells which can be optimized for higher resistance and effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout requires an intermediate fitness level due to its 40-minute duration and strength focus, which suggests significant effort difficulty. However, modifications mentioned in comments and the capability to adjust dumbbell weight allow for beginner-level accessibility as well. Evidence from user comments and channel emphasis on catering to various fitness levels support including beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. While it can accommodate beginners due to modifications, the length and core focus particularly align with the needs of intermediate users aiming to challenge themselves a step further."
