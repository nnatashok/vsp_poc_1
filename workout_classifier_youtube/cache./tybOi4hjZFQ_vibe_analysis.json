  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Guided Wim Hof Method Breathing' video exemplifies 'The Zen Flow' primarily because it focuses on breath-centered, intentional practices aimed at grounding the viewer. The description emphasizes 'entrancing background sounds' and 'focus on nothing but your breath,' which aligns strongly with a meditative and calming experience typical of 'The Zen Flow' (score: 0.9). 'The Deep Recharge' is also relevant as the method aims to reset and refresh the nervous system through deep breathing, providing a lighter, recuperative effect (score: 0.75). Furthermore, there are elements of 'The Meditative Grind' with the session being methodical and involving repeated breathing cycles which help to zone in (score: 0.6). Although the video involves breathwork which might suggest 'The Reboot Workout', the deeper intentionality and focus on breath nuance the vibe towards a more meditative experience."
