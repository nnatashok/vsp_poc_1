  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as a calisthenics session that can be performed with \"no equipment\" according to both the title and description. The tags reinforce this by labeling it a \"no equipment full body workout\" and describe it as a \"bodyweight workout.\u201d The exercises listed, such as pistols, pike push-ups, reverse nordics, and hollow holds, are all bodyweight movements that do not require any specific equipment. While wooden parallettes are mentioned in the description for purchase, there is no indication that they are necessary for this particular workout, but rather an affiliate marketing link for interested viewers. Therefore, the confidence is very high (0.9) that the workout is designed to be performed without any equipment."
