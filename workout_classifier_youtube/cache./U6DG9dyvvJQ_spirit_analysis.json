  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit identified for this workout is \"Structured & Disciplined,\" scored at 0.9. This classification is strongly indicated by the title \"3 Day Calisthenics Workout Plan | FULL PROGRAM\" and the detailed breakdown in the description of how to structure a 3-day calisthenics routine, including specific exercise progressions from beginner to advanced. The video emphasizes a methodical approach with sections dedicated to different aspects of training such as mobility, skill training, and workout splits, which underscores a disciplined, programmatic nature.\n\nThe secondary spirit is \"High-Energy & Intense,\" scored at 0.7. This is supported by the inclusion of handstands and skill training, which require significant physical exertion and intensity. Viewer comments about significant progress and physical achievements (such as first-time pull-ups) further suggest an intense workout effort.\n\nOther spirits, such as \"Flow & Rhythm\" or \"Soothing & Restorative,\" are less applicable as the focus is more on structural planning and intensity rather than continuous flow or recovery."
