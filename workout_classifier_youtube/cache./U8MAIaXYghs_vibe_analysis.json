  "vibesExplanation": "The video 'SUPERMODEL 10 MINUTE INTERVAL RUN | Treadmill Follow Along with IBX Running' primarily fits 'The Firestarter' vibe with high confidence (0.9 score), as it is described as a 'quick 10 minute treadmill interval run.' This suggests a short, intense workout typical of the 'Firestarter' vibe, which is further reinforced by user comments like 'quick workout' and 'I feel so wrung out,' indicating it is both fast and energizing. The nature of interval training\u2014alternating between high and low intensities\u2014aligns well with explosive and high-energy workouts.\n\nThe secondary vibe assigned is 'The Meditative Grind' with moderate confidence (0.5 score). The inclusion of 'run and recovery intervals' suggests a rhythmic, endurance-focused aspect, as treadmill runs can be seen as meditative due to the repetitive motion and suggested speeds and inclines. However, this is less dominant than the short and intense nature captured by 'The Firestarter' vibe.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Endorphin Wave' were considered but ultimately not chosen due to the emphasis on a quick, explosive session rather than a steadily building endurance workout."
