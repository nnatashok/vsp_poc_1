  "spiritsExplanation": "This video's primary focus is on providing a calming, restorative experience designed to help users achieve restful sleep, as evidenced by its title \"15 Minute Guided Breathing For Calm and Restful Sleep\" and the repeated description emphasis on facilitating relaxation and stress reduction, such as \"gentle breathing techniques,\" \"activate the parasympathetic nervous system,\" and \"peaceful and restful night's sleep.\" These elements strongly support the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, earning it a score of 1.0 due to the explicit and strong indicators across title, description, and comments.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of rhythmic music production by the creator, as well as terms like \"rhythmic music\" and \"soothing rhythm of your breath,\" suggest a secondary 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. This aligns with the mind-body connection promoted in the channel's ethos and video intent, warranting a score of 0.6 due to moderate but clear evidence.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to absence of any high-intensity, structured protocol, or physical agility elements, and a strong indoor focus over outdoor or adventure themes."
