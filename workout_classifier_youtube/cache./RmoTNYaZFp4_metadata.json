    "Enjoyed the stretches and gave a thumbs up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc However, if I were to come back to your videos I\u2019d prefer less talk when in the stretches. Ofc all the ques are important, but the constant talk in between was stressing me out a bit and made it harder to connect mentally to the muscles when in the stretches.<br>Wish you all the best!"
