    "Hey Squad, this is going to be a transformative series where I train you and give you tips &amp; reminders along the way. These personal training sessions will be 2x a week. For the more intense NON-SPEAKING workouts keep an eye out in the week as we will be uploading those separately. I hope you enjoy the session \ud83e\udd70\u2764",
    "By far the best workout on YouTube!",
    "A lot of workout videos these days have no talking and I am just watching someone with a countdown clock. These are great exercises with a great personality training you. Motivating but not in your face. Calm energy and amazing weight suggestions and modifications.",
