    "I will be dead honest with you... I thought this would be total BS... but it actually works! This is... really really weird. The burning sensation I had in my stomach was gone when I completed this whole thing. I feel... weird... in a good way. This was my first time ever trying this. Much love.",
    "I love that quote. \u201cSee what wants to be seen. Listen to what wants to be listened to. To do this pause in the gap between thoughts\u201d. That quote should be on a tshirt, poster, or billboard.",
    "I\u2019ve used this meditation many times and have found it really helps me relax. The voiceover is just right (I\u2019ve found voices on other videos to be distracting) and the background music/tones are good too.",
