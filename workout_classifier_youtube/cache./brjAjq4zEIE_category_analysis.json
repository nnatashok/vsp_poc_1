  "categoriesConfidence": 0.9,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Yoga' with a high confidence level. This decision is supported by multiple indicators within the metadata: the video title explicitly states 'Morning Yoga' and '\u092f\u094b\u0917', meaning yoga in Hindi, and the description encourages viewers to participate in a yoga workshop. Additionally, tags such as 'yoga for beginners', '15 minute yoga workout', and user comments praising the effectiveness of 'asanas', which are yoga postures, reinforce this classification. A score of 0.9 was assigned due to these explicit and consistent references to yoga.\n\nThe secondary category of 'Stretching' is also appropriate given the mention of 'Full Body Stretch' in the title and the video focus on flexibility, as suggested by the relaxing and refreshing nature of the routine highlighted in comments. However, since stretching is a component of many yoga routines and the primary emphasis remains on yoga, a score of 0.7 was assigned, accounting for it being a noticeable but secondary focus.\n\nThe channel's overall emphasis on yoga and the community's response affirm the primary categorization, and other potential categories were excluded due to lack of relevant indicators."
