  "vibesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as 'The Warrior Workout' due to the intense and lengthy nature of the HIIT exercises which are characteristic of sweat-dripping and heart-pounding routines. This is supported by the video title 'Extreme HIIT Workout For Fat Burn & Cardio' and tags such as 'hiit workout', 'cardio hiit workout', and 'burn 1000 calories workout', which all suggest a highly intensive, challenging vibe. Additionally, one comment mentions feeling strong and accomplished, indicative of unleashing one's inner beast. This vibe receives a strong score of 0.8.\n\nA secondary vibe is 'The Endorphin Wave' due to comments expressing enjoyment and receiving a rush of endorphins, suggesting steady, feel-good energy build-up through the workout. The extended duration and references to feeling great and having a post-workout endorphin rush align well with this vibe, warranting a score of 0.6. Overall confidence is high at 0.9 due to explicit metadata and comments supporting these vibes."
