  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is 'Stretching' with a high score of 0.9. This choice is largely based on the repeated references to 'mobility stretches,' 'stretching routine,' and 'flexibility routine' in the title, description, and tags, suggesting a strong focus on stretching exercises. The use of terms like 'morning mobility routine' and 'gentle stretches' further supports this classification, indicating that the workout primarily revolves around increasing flexibility through stretching movements.\n\nThe secondary category 'Mat' is included with a score of 0.4, as the workout seems to involve general floor exercises or non-equipment-based movements, which can typically be performed on an exercise mat. However, the evidence is weaker as there is no explicit mention of equipment or a mat, so its presence is inferred from similar types of low-impact, floor-based workouts that do not require equipment.\n\nAlternative categories like 'Yoga' or 'Pilates' were considered but excluded due to the lack of specific references to mindfulness, controlled breathing, or core-focused exercises typical of those disciplines. Furthermore, the description of the workout as 'easy-to-follow' and geared towards beginners emphasizes a focus on gentle stretching rather than complex routines."
