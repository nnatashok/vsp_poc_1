    "Did this workout this morning. I love, love, love your videos\u2764. I was in heart failure two years ago. I had to strengthen my heart again. Your workouts have helped me tremendously. I went from barely doing these videos to doing them without stopping. These videos are a permanent part of my life and continued recovery. Thank you again!",
    "started on march 2, 2025, I wont lie I couldn&#39;t get past 8 minutes, I will not let that discouraged me, i will try to give weekly/biweekly updates on my progress, good luck to everyone going through the journey as well ;)",
    "First time in years that I do a workout with weights. I am obese at 228.8. Not very athletic at all. This was a great beginners workout. I used the modification technique. I hope to master this in another couple of weeks. Will try again the day after tomorrow. THANK YOU for this video. It&#39;s inspiring me.<br><br>Update: 11/20/23 I am down to 210 lbs. Feeling stronger. Love your videos.",
