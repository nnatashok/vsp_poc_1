    "I wish everyone the happiest lives they could live. You deserve it. You\u2019re  worth something, don\u2019t ever doubt it.",
    "Hey stranger on the internet, I hope your days been going well. I know you&#39;re probably going through a lot but I hope you are smiling and laughing more than crying. If youre feeling sad or anxious, take a moment to breath, and do something that makes you relaxed or happy or be with someone you love. If you want to be alone, that&#39;s okay too. But remember that there are 13 million others whom have watched this meditation video and we&#39;re all here if you need some help. May whoever&#39;s reading this all find happiness and love in their lives &lt;3",
