  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily categorized as 'Stretching' because the title and description explicitly mention \"Stretching\" and \"Full Body Stretch,\" alongside terms like 'muscle recovery' and 'postworkoutstretch,' indicating a focus on flexibility and relief from muscle tightness. Additionally, comments highlight the video as guided stretching that relaxes and targets muscles. The 'Stretching' score is 0.9 due to these strong indicators.\n\n'Yoga' is a secondary category with a score of 0.4, as the tags and description mention yoga and some breathing exercises. However, the primary focus appears to be on stretching for muscle recovery, hence the lower score. Comments and descriptions provide some evidence of mindfulness and controlled breathing typical of yoga but do not emphasize yoga postures significantly, keeping the score moderate. Overall, I have high confidence (0.85) in this classification based on the clear presence of stretching elements and some additional yoga cues."
