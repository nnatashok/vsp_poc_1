  "vibesExplanation": "Based on the video's metadata, the workout aligns with several vibes due to its gentle, beginner-friendly nature and morning setting. The main vibe is 'The Comfort Moves' with a score of 0.7. This score is justified by keywords in the title and description like 'Beginner Friendly,' 'no jumping,' 'pyjama workout,' and 'morning exercises,' which suggest a workout that is safe, accessible, and designed to be non-intimidating. Comments like 'gentle yet my heart was pumping' further support this vibe as they emphasize a low-intensity, approachable exercise, perfect for beginners or those needing a gentle routine.\n\nThen, 'The Reboot Workout' scores 0.6 due to elements focusing on 'feel good moves' and 'get the blood pumping,' which suggest a low-stress, refreshing workout intended to energize the body at the start of the day without overexertion, aligning with the vibe's characteristics.\n\nFinally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is scored at 0.4, due to the mention of it still being effective enough to 'get the heart rate up,' as noted in the comments stating 'my heart is pumping.' While not intense enough for a full matching score, the workout's aim to energize supports a mild alignment with this vibe."
