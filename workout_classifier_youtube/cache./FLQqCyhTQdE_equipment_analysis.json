  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title clearly states \"NO EQUIPMENT,\" and the description reiterates that the full body routine requires \"ZERO equipment.\" This suggests that the workout is designed to be performed entirely without the need for any physical workout tools or devices. Additionally, tags such as #noequipmentworkout and #bodyweightworkout further confirm that the exercises are intended to be completed using bodyweight alone. Comments from viewers also support this setup, with no mentions of requiring or using equipment, and expressions like \"no glitz, no gadgets, no gimmicks.\" Consequently, it is evident that no specific equipment is necessary, and the workout is bodyweight only."
