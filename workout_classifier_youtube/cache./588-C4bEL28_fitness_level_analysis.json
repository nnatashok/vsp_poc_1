  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes exercises like renegade rows, heel elevated squats, and push-up pulses, which require good coordination and understanding of form, indicating an intermediate technique difficulty. However, the use of equipment and compound lifts commonly seen in advanced routines (e.g., deadstop lunges, chest presses) justifies a moderate advanced designation, particularly for those unaccustomed to such diverse and demanding moves.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 41:51 minutes long with sets lasting 40 seconds followed by 20 seconds rest. This setup, combined with heavy compound lifts, contributes to a challenging effort level. The description suggests high energy expenditure exercises (e.g., arm and core demanding renegade rows, squats, and lunges) coupled with minimal rest periods, raising the effort to intermediate between challenging and extreme for users not regularly engaged in such long sessions.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Due to the technique requirements and the intense effort level, the workout is suitable for intermediate fitness levels or above. The duration and complexity of exercises like renegade rows suggest that beginners may struggle, while the focus on compound lifts appeals to those with some prior experience. The mention of adjustable dumbbell weights provides some access for intermediates, but advanced fitness levels are preferred to handle the intensity effectively and safely."
