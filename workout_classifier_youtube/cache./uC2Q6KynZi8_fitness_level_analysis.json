  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is designed for beginners, emphasizing simple, foundational movements typical in yoga, such as basic vinyasa flow and stretches. The title contains 'Beginner Flow,' indicating simplicity and lower complexity in technique, while tags reinforce its beginner nature (e.g., 'beginner yoga,' 'yoga for complete beginners'). The description mentions moving in and out of poses slowly to build balance and foundational strength, further indicating a basic level of complexity. User comments also highlight the accessible nature of Kassandra's instructions, making it suitable for those at a beginner stage.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout lasts just under 18 minutes and is designated for beginners, indicating a lower physical demand. Keywords like 'simple' and 'slow paced' suggest reduced energy expenditure and effort. It's also only 17:38 in duration, making it unlikely to be physically taxing, which aligns with light effort difficulty. However, the emphasis on building strength and flexibility could challenge a completely deconditioned user, warranting inclusion of a moderate score.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the significant emphasis on beginner accessibility throughout the metadata, the primary fitness level required is Beginner. The technique is straightforward, and the effort is light to moderate, making it suitable for complete beginners. However, an Intermediate score is included because some movements might challenge users with no prior flexibility training. The short duration and focus on slow-paced poses make it approachable for beginners, while the learning of 'different asanas' noted by a commenter could pose a slight challenge, justifying an inclusion of Intermediate."
