  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is explicitly designed for use with aerobic exercise machines, as indicated by the title \"30 Minutes Workout - Virtual Scenery - Treadmill / Exercise Machine (Cotswolds UK) 1080/60fps\". The repeated mentions of a treadmill and exercise bike in both the tags and description strongly suggest that the primary intent of the video is to provide a virtual scenic experience to accompany workouts on these machines. \n\nThe description lists treadmill, exercise bike, and other machines as potential options, explicitly asking \"Treadmill? Exercise bike? Cross trainer? Rowing machine?\", indicating that these are the main equipment types for which the video is suited. In the comments, users frequently mention using treadmills and exercise bikes, further reinforcing their importance and relevance. Given these factors, the confidence level for both the treadmill and exercise bike is very high at 0.8, as they are clearly central to the intended workout experience provided by the video."
