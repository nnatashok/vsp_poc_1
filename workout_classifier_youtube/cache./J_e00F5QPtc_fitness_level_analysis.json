  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises included such as sumo deadlift, bent arm side lateral raise, goblet squat, and dumbbell pullover require some level of coordination and knowledge of proper form to execute safely, classified as intermediate. The use of relatively heavier weights and compound movements like sumo deadlifts and goblet squats indicate a slight push towards advanced techniques, given they require a decent form to prevent injury.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes a range of compound movements with moderate weights, and 29 minutes duration makes it moderately challenging for someone deconditioned. The mention of using heavy weights suggests increased energy expenditure. However, the low-impact design implies it's not reaching extreme levels, fitting both moderate to challenging effort levels.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulties, the required fitness level skews from beginners who might find the heavier weights challenging, to intermediates and advanced users who can appreciate the muscle engagement and progression over 4-8 weeks. Although some beginners with minimal experience might attempt this, the complexities of the movements and coordination push the more suitable fitness level to intermediate and advanced."
