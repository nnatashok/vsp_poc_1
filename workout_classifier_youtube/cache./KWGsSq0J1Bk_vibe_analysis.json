  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is best classified as 'The Reboot Workout' with a high score of 0.9. The metadata strongly emphasizes features typical of a reboot vibe: deep stretching and relaxing tight muscles ('Say goodbye to tight muscles', 'self-massage') with the assistance of a foam roller, a common tool for releasing muscle tension. This is further supported by the description's focus on recovery ('perfect for a recovery day'). The second vibe, 'The Foundation Builder', receives a score of 0.7, as the video suggests enhancing foundational body comfort and preparing the body for further activity ('great way to warm-up or cool down'). Lastly, 'The Meditative Grind' is assigned a moderate score of 0.5 due to the repetitive, guided nature of the foam rolling process, which requires focus and can have a meditative quality ('guided self-massage'). The comments about the pain and targeted muscle release slightly overlap with more intense workout vibes, but the primary emphasis remains on recovery and foundational movement."
