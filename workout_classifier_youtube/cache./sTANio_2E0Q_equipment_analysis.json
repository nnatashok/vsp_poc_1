  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title and description of the video emphasize a full body stretch/yoga workout focused on stress and anxiety relief. This type of yoga and stretching routine typically requires a mat, especially since the video is described as involving floor exercises. The description explicitly mentions the mat sales link (\"THE MAT I USE (Exercise 6X4)\") and offers a discount code, which signifies its importance for this routine. The channel promotes at-home, real-time workouts, further indicating that the mat is crucial for participant comfort and effectiveness during the workout. Based on this evidence, a mat is needed with very high confidence (1.0) for the workout."
