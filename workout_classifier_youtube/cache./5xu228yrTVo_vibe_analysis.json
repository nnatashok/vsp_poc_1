  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled '10 Minute Body Weight Workout' from WebMD exhibits characteristics that align with 'The Firestarter' and 'The Warrior Workout' vibes. The 'Firestarter' vibe is supported by the short, time-efficient duration (10 minutes) and the description emphasizing an 'energy boosting workout,' which suggests a fast-paced, high-intensity routine designed to provide a quick, explosive burst of exercise. The high number of views (over 166,000) and positive feedback in comments about integrating the workout into a daily routine reinforce this impression. This vibe is assigned a score of 0.7, indicating a strong match due to the workout's brevity and intensity.\n\nThe 'Warrior Workout' vibe is also applicable, as the exercises mentioned (plank, lunges, back exercises) are typically considered fundamental strength-building movements that involve significant physical effort, promoting muscle building and toning. The encouragement in the comments for progressively incorporating more challenging exercises aligns with the 'Warrior Workout' ethos of pushing physical limits. This vibe receives a score of 0.6, reflecting its applicability through strength-focused elements, though slightly less explicit as the core focus than 'The Firestarter.'\n\nPotential vibes such as 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Groove Session' were not selected, as the workout's emphasis is on efficiency and strength rather than continuity or expressiveness."
