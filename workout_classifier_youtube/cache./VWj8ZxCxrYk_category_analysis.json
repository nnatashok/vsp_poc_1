  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as 'Mat' with a score of 0.9 because it involves floor exercises performed on an exercise mat, as supported by the description and title indicating 'at home', 'no equipment', and 'cardio workout'. The use of the mat is further corroborated by the mention of an exercise mat in the description ('THE MAT I USE'). This suggests a workout involving various movements typically performed on a mat. \n\nAdditionally, 'Body weight' has been scored at 0.7, given it is a full body workout with 'basic, low impact exercises' requiring no equipment, suggesting reliance on body weight for resistance. This aligns with typical home workouts involving body weight exercises. \n\nThere is a high confidence level (0.85) due to strong evidence in the title, description, and tags, all explicitly mentioning elements of a mat-based workout and body weight exercises, while feedback from comments demonstrates users' experiences of a challenging but accessible routine, further supporting non-equipment-based exercise classification."
