  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video, titled '21-MIN FLUID WORKOUT FOR WEIGHT LOSS - NO JUMPING, NO REPEATS', embodies several workout vibes based on the metadata and user comments. \n\nFirst, 'The Groove Session' vibe is fitting due to the 'fun and easy' description and the fluid, repetitive nature of the exercises like body rotations, torso twists, and lateral arm circles. The vibe score is moderately strong at 0.7, as the workout emphasizes enjoyment and a continuous flow without pauses for jumps or repetitions, aligning well with a rhythm-focused, moment-capturing experience.\n\n'With phrases like 'no jumping', 'doable routines', and 'regularly do the workout', the 'Meditative Grind' is also applicable, suggesting a repetitive, endurance-focused routine that one can integrate into daily life. This warrants a score of 0.65, representing a steady state of mindful engagement, noted by multiple users who are consistently seeing progress over time.\n\nFinally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is relevant with a lower score of 0.45. The video supports weight loss goals, leading to noticeable physical changes and positive comments about feeling good, suggesting an energetic and satisfying workout experience, though less intensely immersive than might often typify this vibe."
