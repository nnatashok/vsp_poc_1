  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the workout is 'Soothing & Restorative', which is clearly indicated by the focus on improving sleep and relaxing after a long day, as seen in the title 'Yoga for Bedtime for More Restful Sleep' and description emphasizing 'calm you down', 'better sleep', and 'gentle yoga'. The tags such as 'yoga for sleep and relaxation', 'night time yoga', and 'gentle yoga' further reinforce this classification. This workout aims to provide relaxation and stress reduction, earning a high score of 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm', supported by the channel's general emphasis on smooth, continuous movement patterns as seen in the channel description about mental stillness through the fluidity of practice. The comments also hint at the calming voice and atmosphere as integral to the experience. This justifies a score of 0.6 for this spirit, acknowledging the role of coordinated movement and pacing in the routine.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the absence of indicators such as high intensity or sports skills focus, aligning better with relaxation and rhythm."
