  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is 'Meditation' with a high confidence score of 0.9. The title explicitly mentions \"Guided Meditation For Sleep & Relaxation,\" which directly points to a meditation practice, specifically designed for aiding sleep. Tags such as \"guided meditation for sleep,\" \"meditation for stress,\" and \"guided meditation for restful sleep\" reinforce this focus. The description provides further clarity by stating the video includes \"spoken word guidance\" and is a \"healing meditation\" aimed at helping the user relax and fall asleep. The channel, Boho Beautiful Yoga, specializes in yoga and meditation, suggesting that the primary intent of this video aligns with their usual content. Although there's mention of soothing rain sounds, the dominant content is the guided meditation itself, which justifies not selecting 'Breathing exercises' despite the relaxation focus."
