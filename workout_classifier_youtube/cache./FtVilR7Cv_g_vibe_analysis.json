  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video focuses on a 25-minute yoga and stretch session, which suggests a calming and grounding experience typical of 'The Zen Flow'. This is supported by tags like 'yoga stretch', 'morning yoga flow', and 'mobility workout', as well as descriptions mentioning 'mobility and flexibility', 'super relaxed', and 'no expectations'. The title, 'STRONG YOGA & STRETCH', emphasizes strength but in a low-impact, meditative manner, fitting the vibe of 'The Zen Flow' with a strong score of 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, the workout emphasizes recovery and stress relief, suitable for a rest day, aligning with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe. Comments laud its suitability for low energy days and as part of a recovery routine, indicating it provides a restorative break in training. This aligns well with tags and descriptions promoting relaxation and body care, justifying a score of 0.7 for 'The Reboot Workout'.\n\nAlternative vibes such as 'The Comfort Moves' were considered but discounted due to the focus on strength alongside relaxation, rather than purely gentle movement."
