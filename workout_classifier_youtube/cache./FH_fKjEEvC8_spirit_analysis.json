  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is categorized primarily as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.7 due to the frequent references to 'intense prenatal workout', 'challenging prenatal workout', and 'fat burn cardio' in the tags, implying a stimulating cardio session. The channel's reputation for tough workouts, even during pregnancy, further solidifies this spirit.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' matches the workout with a score of 0.6. The emphasis on safety throughout pregnancy and guidelines for specific trimesters ('1st trimester cardio workout') indicates a structured approach. Furthermore, the availability of a prenatal schedule suggests a disciplined framework.\n\nA moderate score of 0.4 for 'Soothing & Restorative' recognizes the prenatal support aspect, aiming to maintain health and well-being during pregnancy. However, intensity is more emphasized than relaxation, leading to a lower match score compared to the other spirits.\n\n'The video's alignment with the 'Sport & Agility' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits is negligible, as it focuses on indoor cardio without sports-specific training or outdoor elements."
