    "Love these 20-25 minute full body workouts. The perfect length to fit into a busy day on a consistent basis.",
    "Oh I really love this 2 rounds version better than the old 4 rounds version. I usually combine 4 videos of the10-15 minute workout. But a 20 or 30 minute workout really fit my preference so I can easily combine it with just one other video.",
    "Thank you for providing us with enough time between exercises to get into the new position.  The 20 minute format is really working for me.  I prefer to work hard for 20 to 30 minutes than to drag the workout on for 40 minutes or so \ud83d\udc4d.",
    "Not gonna lie. I\u2019m thinking, this will be a nice light warmup before my real workout. Nope. It kicked my butt. Incredible workout and minimal equipment.\ud83d\udc4d",
    "Hey Vivi! I&#39;ve been a fan of your workouts since the beginning. I am currently pregnant and expecting our miracle in March 2024. Can you still recommend one of your videos to me? After the birth I will start with  your workout videos again and I&#39;m really happy! so much love xoxo Manu from Germany \ud83e\udd70"
