  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as evidenced by the emphasis on 'mobility, stress relief & active recovery,' which indicates a focus on gentle, relaxation-inducing activities. The description mentions enhancing flexibility and releasing tight muscles, reinforcing this classification. Additionally, keywords such as 'mobility routine,' 'flexibility routine,' and 'rest day stretch' further emphasize the soothing and restorative elements.\n\nThe secondary spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' is reflected in the structure and flow of the video, as indicated by a viewer comment appreciating the 'preview box about what stretch is upcoming.' This suggests a rhythmical and well-paced session, although the overall life pace and intensity remains mild. The titles and tags suggest a structured movement sequence typical of well-organized flow workouts, albeit at a lower intensity.\n\nHigh-Energy & Intense, Sport & Agility, and other higher-intensity spirits are excluded due to the lack of intensity indicators, strong focus on relaxation, and recovery elements inherent in a stretching routine."
