  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled \"Introduction to Pilates - Workout 1 | NHS\" primarily carries the vibe of 'The Masterclass Workout'. This is because the emphasis is on technique, skill-building, and a methodical approach suitable for beginners. The description highlights that it is 'ideal for people who are completely new to Pilates or have a low fitness level,' making it a perfect fit for skill-building and introductory techniques, which is central to a Masterclass experience. This vibe is further supported by comments appreciating the clear, slow instruction and acknowledging it as a starting point for beginners. \n\nA secondary vibe is 'The Reboot Workout', as the description mentions 'extremely gentle and slow-paced classes making it ideal for people... with conditions or past injuries,' which aligns with a low stress, revitalizing workout experience. The program's focus on safety and gradual introduction to Pilates reflects the rejuvenating and restorative nature of a reboot. \n\nThe absence of high-intensity or competitive elements excludes other vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor'. The high confidence level is due to strong explicit indicators in the description and comments."
