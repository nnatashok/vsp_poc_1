  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled '10 Min HIIT Cycle Bike Workout' strongly indicates a 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to the use of 'HIIT' (High-Intensity Interval Training) in both the title and tags, which signifies fast-paced, maximum effort cycles. The workout structure, as detailed in the description - 12 sets of 30 seconds on and 15 seconds off with high resistance - reinforces this classification with a score of 0.9. The objective of pushing 'your body to the limit' underscores the intensity.\n\nAdditionally, 'Structured & Disciplined' attributes are evident in the systematic approach to the workout, laid out as a minute-by-minute plan involving specific intervals and recovery periods. This methodical format justifies a score of 0.6 for this spirit, determining a clear and disciplined structure. \n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are not applicable due to the focus being primarily on intensity rather than smooth, continuous flow or relaxation. The user comments support both the intensity and structured nature, mentioning a strong workout, discipline, and intervals."
