  "title": "A Deeper Connection with Your Higher Self  (Guided Meditation)",
  "description": "This is an Original 10 minute guided meditation recorded by us.  As the world awakens, may you align your thoughts, your actions, and your intentions with the purest essence of your being.  Let love be your compass, guiding you towards compassion, kindness, and joy.  Embrace the truth that you are a vessel of divine light, here to illuminate the path for yourself and others.  Take a moment to reflect on your dreams, your aspirations, and the miracles that await you.  Visualize yourself stepping into the grand tapestry of your purpose, embracing every step with grace and courage.  Trust in the wisdom of your higher self, for it holds the keys to unlock the infinite possibilities that lie before you.\n\nToday, as you navigate the ebb and flow of life's currents, remember to seek stillness within.

  "comments": [
    "I saw my higher self energy, she is powerful, and she is purple! Full of light for me, she moves a lot too, but I can see her forming so I can see her properly, it is my first time seeing her, so I shivered everywhere when I saw her coming. It was beautiful, I stayed with her for an extra 5 minutes after the video was done. It was beautiful.",
    "I started crying uncontrolably which I&#39;ve never experienced while meditating before and felt a ton of love and a weird kind of knowing that the struggles in my life right now are going to lead to something good, thank you for this.",
    "i startled bawling uncontrollably tears of happiness. I realized how badly i\u2019ve been treating myself and my higher self doesn\u2019t want that for me. it needs me to unconditionally love myself and celebrate the small wins.",
    "I felt so happy during this. I can&#39;t explain it, I was nearly hyperventilating. When I pressed that higher heart button I literally gasped. It feels so good",
    "I just started a daily meditation practice.  I wanted short periods of time so I will stick with it and build from there.  This is perfect and achievable before work.  I love connecting with my source!  Thank you!"
