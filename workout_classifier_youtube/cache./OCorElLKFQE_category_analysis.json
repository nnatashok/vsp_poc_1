  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized primarily under 'Meditation' due to multiple strong indicators in the metadata. The title \"5 Minute Guided Meditation for Gratitude | Mindful Movement\" explicitly mentions \"meditation\" and \"guided meditation,\" which is reinforced by tags like \"gratitude meditation,\" \"short meditation,\" and \"guided meditation.\" The description also strongly supports this with phrases like \"practice the meditation for gratitude\" and \"great guided meditation,\" as well as references to fostering a positive mindset and stress relief. Furthermore, the channel, The Mindful Movement, specializes in meditation content, with guided meditation being a major focus mentioned both in the video and channel descriptions.\n\n'Breathing exercises' is considered with moderate confidence (score 0.5) as the description suggests mindful breathing with \"invigorating you with each breath\" and the tags include \"breathing\". However, the focus of the video is primarily meditation, so this category is secondary."
