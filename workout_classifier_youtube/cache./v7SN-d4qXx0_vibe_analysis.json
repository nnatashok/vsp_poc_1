  "vibesExplanation": "The selected vibes match the video very well based on the metadata provided. \"The Sleep Prep\" vibe is strongly supported by the video title \"Bedtime Yoga\" and description focusing on preparing for rest and alleviating stress and tension. The tags further reinforce this with terms like \"yoga for sleep,\" \"night time yoga,\" and \"evening yoga.\" These indicators suggest a workout designed to help viewers relax and prepare for sleep, justifying a perfect score of 1.0.\n\nAdditionally, \"The Reboot Workout\" vibe is evident but to a lesser extent. The description mentions this yoga as a remedy for stress and imbalance, which aligns with the idea of a gentle, low-stress reset. Although the primary focus is sleep preparation, the general theme of relaxation and gentle stretching suggests elements of a reboot, earning a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nOther vibes like \"The Deep Recharge\" could have been considered, but the emphasis on sleep and preparing for bedtime makes \"The Sleep Prep\" the more accurate fit. The user comments provide qualitative evidence of this video's impact on sleep and stress, further confirming the analysis."
