    "I have a feeling this channel is gonna grow really fast. Amazing content !!",
    "I am doing yoga, calistenics and movement aswell  togheter  with acrobatics. Couple  year of experience now and Still I found  your person  as a motivation. Never stop moving  my  friend!",
    "Even if i am more advanced, I watched &#39;til the end just for the pleasure of seeing Gabo :)",
    "I love your channel, Gabo! I&#39;m an avid cyclist who has been trying to cross-train with calisthenics and proper dieting to get the weight down and lean-up! I enjoy the breakdowns of your movements, getting the proper body-position and form dialed before you move through the exercise!  Your plank is a good example! A lot of people don&#39;t push into the hollow position with a rounded back! Keep the great videos coming. I&#39;d like to see more body-weight leg workouts and shoulder/trap progressions! Keep the great content coming!"
