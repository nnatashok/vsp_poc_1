  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is predominantly classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.95. This classification is supported by the title and description highlighting it as a 'cool down' and 'stretch' routine, aimed at recovery and relaxation after intense workouts. The comments emphasize the workout's relaxing and refreshing effects, such as aiding in maintaining a relaxed mind and improving flexibility over time. Additionally, tags like 'cool down', 'stretch', and 'slow workout' further indicate a focus on gentle pacing and recovery. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present with a moderate score of 0.5, inferred from the continuous movement pattern necessary in a stretch routine, as supported by comments on progressive flexibility improvement and the mind-body connection implied by maintaining relaxed neck positions. Other spirits were excluded due to lack of evidence supporting high energy, structure, athletic skills, or outdoor elements."
