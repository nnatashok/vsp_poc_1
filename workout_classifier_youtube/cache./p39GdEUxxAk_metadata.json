    "That made my back feel a lot better today after being in bed most of the weekend, glad to get back at it, thank you!",
    "Enjoyed the choice of music for this one. \u2728",
    "Thank you for a quick yoga video. That is perfect for the morning. I just set an intention yesterday to start doing yoga before I do anything else every morning for the sake of my heart, health and body health. I almost skipped it this morning because I also have school work to do and I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to fit it all in... But the 5-minute video helped me honor all of my priorities, and even though I only did yoga for about 5 minutes, I already feel a little bit better physically, and definitely better emotionally because I achieved a goal that I had set. Thank you for helping me do that with this video!",
    "\u2026I stayed because the jazz(my favorite music)and I was glad,the yoga sequence was just perfect,quick,easy ,relaxing when you got no time,but got to move things anyways \ud83d\ude43",
