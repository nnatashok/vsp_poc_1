  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is primarily rated as Beginner due to the focus on simple yoga poses and breathing exercises. The description explicitly labels it as a beginner's routine, and the listed asanas and pranayama techniques are fundamental and basic, suitable for those new to yoga. Suryanamaskar, although slightly more complex, is generally taught to beginners. Several comments reflect first-time practitioners benefiting from the session, which supports the accessibility for beginners.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 19:59 minutes long, which suggests a relatively light engagement. The practices involve basic yoga poses and controlled, slow breathing exercises which typically have low energy expenditure. This aligns with a 'Light' effort difficulty, appropriate for new and deconditioned users. However, slightly more active sequences like Suryanamaskar introduce a moderate effort component.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level leans heavily towards Beginner, as the video is explicitly designed for beginners and includes fundamental yoga postures and techniques that are not physically demanding. The Intermediate level is included due to Suryanamaskar and the option for more intensity in breathing exercises like Kapalbhati, which may be unfamiliar and slightly challenging for complete novices. The channel's broad audience and the video's intention to introduce yoga suggest a welcoming entry point for people with low motivation or poor physical shape."
