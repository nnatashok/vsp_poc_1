  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout title \"Yoga For Hips & Lower Back Release\" and the description emphasize uniting breath and body for cultivation of balance and stability, which strongly indicates a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This is reinforced by the tags such as 'yoga for back pain', 'yoga for flexibility', and 'yoga for pain relief', which suggest a focus on healing and relief rather than intensity. The high play count and positive comments about the workout's impact, like relieving tension and aiding in personal recovery, further support this classification with a score of 0.9 for 'Soothing & Restorative'. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also applicable here, as yoga generally involves smooth, continuous movements that require some level of coordination and rhythm. This is implied by the title's focus on \"release\" and the description's mention of going inward to unite breath and body. Hence, it receives a score of 0.7. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the lack of any mention of high exertion or athletic skills in the metadata."
