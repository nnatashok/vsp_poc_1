  "vibesExplanation": "The video 'Cardio Workout At Home - 30 Min Aerobic Exercise' from Roberta's Gym primarily embodies 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe with a score of 0.7. This is supported by the description emphasizing calorie burn and heart-health benefits, suggesting a steady, feel-good cardio session. The title and tags like 'aerobic exercise' and 'cardio burn fat' imply an energetic workout that progressively elevates mood and energy, common in endorphin-boosting activities.\n\nThe workout also somewhat fits 'The Groove Session' vibe with a score of 0.5. The aerobic nature of the workout implies rhythm and fluidity, typical of dance-like, expressive movements, even without explicit mention of music or dance in the metadata.\n\nAdditionally, there is a slight alignment with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, with a score of 0.4, due to the repetitive, enduring nature of a 30-minute cardio routine. Comments about making it a daily habit and the repetitive, continuous motion of aerobic exercise support the meditative aspect.\n\nWhile these three vibes are most fitting, other potential vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush' were excluded due to the absence of high intensity or unpredictability characteristics in the workout or its description."
