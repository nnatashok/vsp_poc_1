  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the focus on HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) and cardio, which are strongly associated with fast-paced, vigorous activity designed to get the heart pumping. Evidence for this includes phrases like 'intense cardio and calorie burn' and 'get your heart rate up,' as well as the inclusion of exercises like 'Pulsing Jump Squat' and 'High Knee,' which are typically high-intensity. The comment about participants' heart rates and physical exertion further supports this classification, earning it a score of 0.9. \n\nAdditionally, 'Structured & Disciplined' is applicable, as the workout employs a 40/20s interval structure, indicative of a methodical approach to fitness with specific timing protocols. The description's suggestion to 'Try 3-4 rounds for a full workout' implies a disciplined routine that fits this spirit, deserving a score of 0.7. \n\nOther potential spirits, like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative,' were not chosen because the focus is not on smooth continuity or relaxation. 'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are less relevant here, given the indoor, non-sport specific context and lack of environmental challenges."
