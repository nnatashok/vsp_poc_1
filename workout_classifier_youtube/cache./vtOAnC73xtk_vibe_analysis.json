  "vibesExplanation": "The video 'Powerful Guided Meditation for Healing & Letting Go' primarily embodies 'The Deep Recharge' vibe, scoring 0.9. This is supported by the key focus on healing, inner peace, and gentle emotional release, evident in phrases like 'healing meditation,' 'energy healing,' and 'positive affirmations.' The emphasis on calming techniques like meditation for letting go suggests a restorative experience aligning perfectly with 'The Deep Recharge.'\n\nAdditionally, the vibe of 'The Zen Flow' scores 0.8, as the video employs a soothing, breath-centered practice, designed to ground and provide serenity\u2014evident from the focus on 'mindfulness meditation' and 'inner peace.' The moderate duration of 10 minutes and elements of visualization also support this classification as a calm, intentional practice.\n\nCompeting vibes like 'The Reboot Workout' were excluded due to the lack of a physical dynamic focus, which centers on physical rejuvenation rather than emotional or spiritual healing."
