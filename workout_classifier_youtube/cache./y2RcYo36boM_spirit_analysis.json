  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is classified under the 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Structured & Disciplined' spirits. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is strongly indicated by the workout's format as a Pilates session, which typically involves fluid movements and a focus on the mind-body connection. The phrase \"move and feel energised\" from the description further supports this classification, highlighting the smooth and energizing nature of the session. A score of 0.8 reflects strong alignment with this spirit. \n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also a strong candidate because Pilates is known for methodical and precise movement patterns, with an emphasis on form and technique. The structured approach of the session, tailored for both beginners and moderate levels, showcases a disciplined routine focused on technical execution, earning it a score of 0.7. \n\nThe absence of intense or high-energy language, sports-specific training, or emphasis on outdoor elements justifies not selecting the other spirits. Additionally, while the session can be somewhat restorative, its primary focus on movement and energy places more weight on the selected spirits."
