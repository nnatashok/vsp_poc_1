  "vibesExplanation": "The workout 'Calisthenics For Beginners (DAILY ROUTINE)' is primarily aligned with 'The Foundation Builder' vibe, scoring 0.8. This classification is supported by the video's clear emphasis on foundational exercises, as indicated by the title and description that cater to beginners in calisthenics. This routine aims to strengthen weak points and build basic strength, true to the 'Foundation Builder' vibe.\n\nThe secondary vibe, 'The Comfort Moves' with a score of 0.5, is inferred from the top comment that praises the workout as 'ACTUALLY beginner friendly', suggesting a safe and accessible introduction to calisthenics. The exercises involve mostly bodyweight movements and simple calisthenics, emphasizing ease rather than intensity.\n\nLastly, 'The Progression Quest' earns a score of 0.4. While not overtly focused on long-term progression like strength cycles, the promise of follow-up videos and advancing exercises (e.g., negative push-ups and pulls) implies an incremental progression path for viewers, aligning with this vibe.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Disciplined Grind' or 'The Meditative Grind' were excluded due to a lack of emphasis on intense focus or endurance, typical of those vibes."
