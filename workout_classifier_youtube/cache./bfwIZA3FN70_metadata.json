    "I am in month 7 and for the last 2 weeks my back bones and muscles ache so bad. I cant even walk most of the time. I hope this will help.<br>Edit; this worked like magic. I did the exercises and slept. The next day my pain went away slowly and now I did it again. I feel sooo good. I have no pain or discomfort at all. I will keep doing these until birth. Thanks !!!",
    "Dear Michelle, thank you for this excersize. I&#39;m in my 3rd trimester and my back started killing me. Everyone told me that back pain is &quot;normal&quot; for this pregnancy phase, but I found this video, and I was practicing these excersizes twice a day, in combination with a lot of walking and it did a real magic for me. Thank you once again. Greetings from Croatia!",
