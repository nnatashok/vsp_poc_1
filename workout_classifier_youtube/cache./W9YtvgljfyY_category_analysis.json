  "categoriesExplanation": "The video \"10-Minute Guided Stretching Routine for Runners\" is classified as primarily focusing on 'Stretching' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is supported by the video title, which explicitly mentions 'Guided Stretching Routine,' and the description, which emphasizes a 10-minute routine targeting common tight areas for runners. The tags further reinforce this focus with phrases like 'stretching for runners' and 'guided stretching runners.' Therefore, 'Stretching' is given the highest score as the central activity.\n\nThe category 'Running' is also included with a moderate score of 0.5. This is due to the video's specific targeting of runners, aiming to improve flexibility and recovery from running. The description suggests doing the routine after running and associates the content's benefits with running activities. While 'Running' is not the direct activity, it is a significant context for this stretching routine, thus warranting its inclusion with a moderate score.\n\nOther potential categories like 'Mat' or 'Yoga' were not selected, as the focus is explicitly on stretching and not general mat work or yoga postures. This comprehensive analysis results in the selected categorization with high confidence."
