    "As an athlete looking at 40, calisthenics has lit a fire under me and I really appreciate the clarity and the effectiveness of your teaching style- from the information in your videos I know how to increase or decrease difficulty and for this routine in particular I just added a few reps to each of the sets. Keep up the great work!",
    "At 60, never too late to start calisthenics, just begin with the basics"
