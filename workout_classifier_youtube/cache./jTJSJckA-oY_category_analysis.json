  "categoriesConfidence": 0.9,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Meditation' due to the repeated emphasis on meditation in the title ('Guided Breathing Meditation for Deep Relaxation and Inner Stillness'), description, and tags, including terms like 'Guided meditation', 'Relaxing meditation', and 'stillness meditation.' These indicators provide very high confidence (1.0 score) that meditation is a central focus. \n\nThe secondary category is 'Breathing exercises', supported by mentions of '30 minutes of guided breathing' in the description and tags such as 'Breathing meditation' and 'breath.' The detailed explanation on how to position oneself for the breathing portion further supports this classification. The score of 0.8 reflects a strong emphasis but secondary to meditation. \n\nThere is no evidence suggesting the relevance of other categories such as 'Yoga', 'Pilates', or physical fitness categories, making these categories inapplicable."
