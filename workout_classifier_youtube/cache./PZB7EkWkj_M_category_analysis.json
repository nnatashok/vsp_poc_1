  "categoriesExplanation": "The video titled \"45 MIN FULL BODY YOGA FLOW || Vinyasa Flow For Balance, Flexibility & Strength\" clearly indicates that the primary activity is a yoga session, specifically a Vinyasa yoga flow. Both the title and description emphasize yoga. The tags also repeatedly include terms like 'vinyasa yoga', 'yoga for flexibility', and 'yoga flow', reinforcing that yoga is the main focus. Therefore, Yoga is assigned a score of 1 due to its clear and central presence.\n\nThe description mentions an emphasis on opening hips and shoulders, as well as working on flexibility and balance, which aligns with stretching activities. These elements justify an additional category of Stretching, though as a secondary characteristic, hence the score of 0.4.\n\nThe very high confidence level (0.95) is due to the direct and strong references to yoga in the title, tags, and description. There is no indication of other practices like Pilates or Weight Workout, so these were excluded from consideration."
