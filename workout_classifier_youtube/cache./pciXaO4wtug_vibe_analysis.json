  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is clearly designed for relaxation and accessibility, as seen in the title 'Chair Yoga Stretch for Beginners, Seniors & Everyone'. This indicates it's low-impact and inclusive, aligning with 'The Comfort Moves' vibe, which suits safe, feel-good movement (score: 0.9). This is supported by tags like 'Chair yoga', 'Yoga for seniors', and 'Relaxing workout', which emphasize a gentle, approachable nature. Consequently, 'The Reboot Workout' vibe also fits (score: 0.7) given the description mentions stress relief, muscle ache easing, and the repetition of 'breath', suggesting elements of total-body refresh. Comments reflect a sensation of feeling better and more stretched, which reinforces both vibes, especially the refreshing and soothing aspects. Other vibes, like 'The Zen Flow', were less applicable due to the specific focus on chair-based routines rather than breath-centric mindful movements."
