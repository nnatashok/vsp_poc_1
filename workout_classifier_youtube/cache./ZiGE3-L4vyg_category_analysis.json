  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified under 'Indoor biking' with a score of 1.0 due to the consistent references to indoor cycling activities. Keywords such as 'indoor cycling,' 'spin,' 'spinning,' 'turbo trainer,' and 'wahoo bike' in the tags, title ('HIIT Indoor Cycling Workout'), and description confirm this category. The channel's focus on cycling with over 3 million subscribers further emphasizes its clear relevance to indoor biking.\n\nThe 'HIIT' category is also applicable with a score of 0.9. The title explicitly mentions 'HIIT,' and the description highlights 'interval session' and '30 second max effort,' both of which are characteristic of high-intensity interval training. Viewer comments discussing the intensity and workout difficulties further support this classification.\n\nOther categories were considered but excluded due to lack of relevant evidence. For instance, 'Weight workout' or 'Body weight' were not mentioned in any capacity, focusing clearly on cycling dynamics and interval training characteristics."
