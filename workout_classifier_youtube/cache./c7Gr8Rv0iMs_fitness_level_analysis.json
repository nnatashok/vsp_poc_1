  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video features basic stretching and mobility exercises such as Plank Walk Out, Cobra Pose, and Child's Pose, which are straightforward and require minimal coordination. These are suitable for beginners but also include slightly more complex poses like Lizard Pose and Warrior 1, which demand more awareness and flexibility, thus warranting an intermediate level. The emphasis on breath work and reducing muscle tension also points to a beginner to intermediate technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout primarily consists of static stretches and mobility exercises, which are typically low in energy expenditure and effort difficulty. The video duration is just over 12 minutes, indicating a session meant for gentle activity rather than a strenuous workout. Therefore, this aligns with a light difficulty score. However, the flexibility and mobility focus could pose a moderate physical challenge for those with extremely tight muscles, justifying a secondary moderate score.",
