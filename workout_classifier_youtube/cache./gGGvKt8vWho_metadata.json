    "We tackled assembling the bike as a family project. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxzg0clhbtRf2gGxPkVETFKJJKGqdsorQu\">https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxzg0clhbtRf2gGxPkVETFKJJKGqdsorQu</a>  The package is heavy, but I have 2 teen boys that were able to move it. The written instructions were great- we didn&#39;t need to watch the videos, but it was good knowing that the option was there if we needed it. After we were able to get it set up, the boys each rode 3 miles and I rode 8 and the bike stayed quiet. The display is easy to reset, and you can put it on whichever setting you are using (time, distance, calories, etc). I will say that my butt is a little sore from the seat, but that could be because I haven&#39;t rode in a while. While it is comfortable for me, it was not comfortable with the seat position for my friend (could not move the seat back far enough and he slightly looked like a kid riding a tricycle that he had outgrown). He also said that the seat hurt his manly parts. We are going to look for a different seat that will be compatible with this bike for him.I did purchase the Wahoo Cadence sensor and strapped it to the crank of one of the pedals. This will sync with my Apple Watch, iPhone and will import data in to my Health app. Wahoo does have other sensors available other than cadence. I can also keep either my phone or my iPad on the display and they both feel pretty secure.",
    "These guys are my heroes! Did my best to pretend to keep up! Loads of fun and very inspiring. THANK YOU!",
    "Great session. Not for kidding . It&#39;s a pro workout. Thank you so much. CGN is the best I never seen on Youtube.",
    "Shoutout from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania! Love the video - along with the top 10 ways to lose weight on a bike video this channel has helped me lose around 20 pounds so far and going strong. It would be great if you could make a version of this video without the background music so it just had the lady&#39;s voice counting timers and giving encouragement. That way we could play this video and use our own music playlist or even play it while watching a movie so we still know when the intervals are coming.\u00a0",
    "Really old masterpiece!<br>Did this one today and felt great in the quarantine."
