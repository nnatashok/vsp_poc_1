  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Yoga' with a high confidence score of 0.9, based on explicit mentions in the title, tags, and description of 'yoga routine,' 'yoga for beginners,' and 'yoga follow along.' The video features a 30-minute yoga session focusing on various asanas and practices, which are traditional yoga postures and routines like Suryanamaskar, Pawanmuktasana, and others. The inclusion of pranayama (breathing exercises) justifies the secondary category 'Breathing exercises' with a score of 0.8. Breathing techniques such as Bhastrika, Kapalbhati, and Anulom Vilom are detailed in the description and tags, reinforcing the significant focus on yoga-based breathing exercises. Comments reinforce the video's yoga practice nature, with references to mental peace and physical benefits tied to these exercises. The lack of mention of other exercise types (e.g., Pilates, Mat workouts) in the metadata further supports the exclusion of other categories."
