  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a floor stretching routine, as explicitly mentioned in the title \"10 MIN BEGINNER FLOOR STRETCHES\" and reiterated in the description, where it states \"All of the stretches will be on the floor today, so grab your mat and get ready to have a comfy stretch!\" This indicates very high confidence that a mat is required for the workout to provide comfort while performing stretches on the floor. The tags, such as \"morning yoga stretch\" and \"full body stretch yoga,\" further support the notion that the workout is similar to a yoga routine, typically performed on a mat."
