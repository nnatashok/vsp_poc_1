  "vibesExplanation": "The video's primary vibe is 'The Zen Flow' due to its grounding, breath-centered, and unhurried qualities, as highlighted by the focus on yoga postures and various pranayama techniques. Phrases in the description like 'channelise our energy into something like yoga,' 'boost your immunity,' and 'live a disease-free life' signal a grounding and calming practice, aligning well with 'The Zen Flow' (score: 0.8). 'The Reboot Workout' is also a fit with a score of 0.7 due to the restorative qualities of yoga, particularly the inclusion of Shavasana, which is known for cooling the body down and providing deep relaxation. Lastly, 'The Comfort Moves' is somewhat applicable with a score of 0.5, as the video is designed for beginners and emphasizes ease and accessibility, which can add a comforting aspect to the practice. The lack of intense physical exertion excludes more dynamic vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush'. Overall, the confidence level is high due to explicit descriptions and positive user feedback emphasizing relaxation and well-being."
