  "spiritsExplanation": "The spirit of this workout is predominantly 'High-Energy & Intense' due to its focus on calorie burning and fat loss, as indicated by the high calorie burn figures (747 calories) and phrases like 'Go All Out' during intense intervals. The workout includes rapid bursts with minimal rest, aligning with intense, heart-pumping exercise styles. The description mentions trying to reach a certain calorie burn each time, with penalties for not achieving it, emphasizing the high-energy demand. This is reinforced by user comments mentioning rapid weight loss and significant exertion, resulting in high confidence for this classification. \n\nAdditionally, this workout is 'Structured & Disciplined' as it follows a precise interval regimen with decreasing rest periods and specified calorie/stride targets. The description outlines specific timings for exercise and rest, demonstrating a methodical approach. The encouragement of modifying the workout intensity suggests an adaptable, but still disciplined structure, leading to high confidence for this spirit as well. \n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded as there is no emphasis on smooth movement, relaxation, or recovery-focused elements."
