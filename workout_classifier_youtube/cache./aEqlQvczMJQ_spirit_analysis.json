  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is clearly 'Soothing & Restorative', supported by strong indicators in the metadata. The video is titled '10-Minute Meditation For Sleep', which directly suggests a focus on relaxation and stress reduction. The description emphasizes the goal of easing the mind and body into sleep, reinforcing the restorative nature of the content. Tags such as 'soothing relaxation', 'guided meditation for sleep', and 'insomnia relief' confirm this focus on recovery and calming effects. The comments further support this, as users express expectations of relaxation and mention the calming purpose. The score of 1 denotes a perfect embodiment of this spirit.\n\nThere is a slight element of 'Flow & Rhythm', with a score of 0.3, due to the meditation possibly having a rhythmical narration and music that aids the smooth transition into sleep. This is inferred from the involvement of a mindfulness coach and the general structure of guided meditations, although it's not the primary focus here.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility', are excluded due to the clear emphasis on soothing and relaxation."
