  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily in the 'HIIT' and 'Indoor biking' categories based on several key pieces of metadata. The title 'HIIT Workout - Insane 15 Minute Spin Bike Workout' directly mentions 'HIIT' and 'Spin Bike,' strongly indicating a high-intensity interval training workout using a stationary bike. The description reinforces this by describing it as a '15 Minute Spin Bike HIIT workout,' highlighting the time-efficient, intense nature of this exercise. \n\nThe tags include 'hiit workout,' 'spin bike workouts,' and 'interval training workouts,' which all further confirm the nature of the workout. The high view count and likes, along with supportive comments about the workout's effectiveness and suitability for specific conditions (e.g., knee issues), corroborate the HIIT aspect as being central. \n\nGiven the clarity and consistency across the title, description, and tags, the assignment has very high confidence in these categories, with scores of 0.9 reflecting their strong presence. Other categories were excluded as there is no indication of other types of exercises involved in this workout."
