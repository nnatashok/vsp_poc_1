  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is prominently featured in this workout as it focuses on stretching, flexibility, and mobility to alleviate muscle stiffness and improve joint health, which are key aspects of restorative practices. The description highlights the gentle nature of the session, noting its suitability for daily practice and its purpose in reducing stiffness, clearly aligning with restorative qualities. The tag 'stretch' and phrases in the description like 'increase your mobility and flexibility' further support this categorization. User comments such as 'cries in broomstick flexibility' and mentioning Pamela's 'soothing' voice suggest a calming and approachable session, bolstering this classification with a strong confidence score of 0.85.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is a secondary spirit due to the structured routine that suggests a smooth sequence of movements, conducive to a rhythmic flow as indicated by the focus on full-body stretching. The title's mention of 'routine,' combined with the lack of equipment and the call to use a soft surface like a yoga mat, resonates with a flowing practice. User comments mentioning how 'this felt like 5 minutes' imply a seamless, engaging flow. This spirit is assigned a moderate score of 0.6 given the inferred elements, although it is less dominant than the primary Soothing & Restorative spirit. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the gentle nature and lack of intense or athletic components in the material. The overall confidence in the spirit identification is high, at 0.9, due to explicit evidence found in both the description and viewer feedback."
