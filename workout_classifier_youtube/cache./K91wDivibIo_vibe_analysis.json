  "vibesExplanation": "The video, titled 'Pilates for Better Sleep Workout,' explicitly indicates a strong focus on preparing for sleep, which aligns with 'The Sleep Prep' vibe. The description emphasizes reducing stress, relieving tension, and winding down, further supporting this vibe, earning it a high score of 0.95. Additionally, the use of terms like 'balance of movement and stretching' and 'wind down' suggest elements of 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, warranting a score of 0.65 due to its focus on gentle stretches and total-body refreshment.\n\nThere are also elements of 'The Zen Flow' due to the breath-centered and relaxing nature of the workout, as indicated by user comments appreciating the focus on breath and relaxation. The calming and intentional nature of Pilates, in this context, aligns with this vibe, yet to a lesser degree than 'The Sleep Prep,' resulting in a score of 0.60.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Comfort Moves' were considered but found less applicable due to the video's primary focus on preparing for restful sleep rather than safe, cozy movement. The confidence level is high (0.85) owing to clear indicators from the title and user feedback."
