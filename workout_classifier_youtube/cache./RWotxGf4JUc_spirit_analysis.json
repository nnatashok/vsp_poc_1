  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit, indicated by terms such as \"dynamic yoga flow\" and \"morning flow\" in the title and description. This suggests a smooth, continuous pattern of movement, aligning with the mind-body connection aspect typical of this spirit. The inclusion of \"energy, strength & flexibility\" supports the dynamic flow connotation, fitting a score of 0.8 for Flow & Rhythm.\n\nThe second spirit, \"Soothing & Restorative,\" is identified due to the description mentioning a full-body stretch to enhance recovery and balance, which are key elements of restorative practices. The description's emphasis on starting the day and recovery suggests a gentler, restorative approach, justifying a score of 0.7 for this spirit. \n\n\"High-Energy & Intense\" is excluded as the focus isn't on maximum effort but rather on a balanced, energizing start to the day. Tags like \"yoga for beginners\" and user comments further imply a more accessible and flowing style rather than high intensity."
