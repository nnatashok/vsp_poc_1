  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout spirit of 'Soothing & Restorative' was assigned with a very high confidence score of 0.9, as both the title and description explicitly emphasize relaxation and restful sleep. Phrases such as 'Deep and Restful Sleep,' 'help you relax,' and 'deeply soothing' directly align with restorative intentions. The tags reinforce this, with multiple references to 'restorative,' 'breathwork therapy,' and 'breathwork for deep sleep.' The top comments further validate this classification, with users reporting relaxation and improved sleep, such as 'falling asleep faster' and 'guided breath work for sleep.' Overall, the video's clear purpose of facilitating relaxation and sleep through breathwork strongly embodies the Soothing & Restorative spirit."
