  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout primarily features pushup variations, which are generally categorized as basic to moderately complex exercises. Standard pushups can be considered beginner-level with minimal coordination requirements. However, variations such as diamond and wide arm pushups require more control and body awareness, elevating the technique difficulty to intermediate for some users.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of completing 100 pushups in various forms within a time-efficient 9:28 duration. Performing multiple pushup variations in one session requires significant upper body endurance, resulting in moderate to challenging effort for less fit individuals. However, the short duration and focus on one exercise category keep the overall energy demand manageable.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is broadly accessible due to the scalability of pushup reps and the ability to modify based on personal capacity, which allows beginners to start slowly and advanced users to perform full sets. Despite the implied higher intensity, the comments suggest users can scale back to match their fitness level, which makes it appropriate for a range from beginner to advanced, with adjustments in reps or rest."
