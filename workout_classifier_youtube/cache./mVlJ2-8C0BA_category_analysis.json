  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Weight workout' with a score of 0.9. This is strongly indicated by the video title \"30 Min FULL BODY DUMBBELL WORKOUT\" and the description which mentions the workout is focused on using dumbbells to perform exercises that target all major muscle groups. Tags such as \"dumbbell workout,\" \"full body dumbbell workout,\" and \"weight training for women over 50\" further support this categorization. Additionally, comments from viewers often reference the use of weights, confirming that dumbbells are a central element of this workout.\n\nA secondary category considered is 'Body weight' with a score of 0.3. While the primary focus is on dumbbells, some exercises could involve movements that use body weight as well, but there is minimal indication of this as a primary component, hence the lower score."
