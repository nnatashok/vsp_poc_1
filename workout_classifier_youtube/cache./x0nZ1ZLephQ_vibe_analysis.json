  "vibesExplanation": "The video 'Meditation For Mental Balance and Grounding' from Yoga With Adriene is strongly associated with 'The Zen Flow' vibe. This assessment is based on explicit references in the description and comments to themes like 'balance', 'clarity', and 'grounding', which align with a grounding, breath-centered practice. The title itself emphasizes 'Meditation', further supporting this vibe. \n\nThe second vibe, 'The Deep Recharge', is also applicable, as the practice is described as a way to 'connect the brain to the body for mental health' and to 'observe with loving-kindness and bring awareness', which suggests a focus on mental rejuvenation and stress release. Comments mention terms like 'peace', 'stillness', and 'calm', reinforcing the calming and restorative nature of the session.\n\nThe scores reflect the video\u2019s strong alignment with both vibes, with especially high confidence in 'The Zen Flow' due to consistent indicators across various metadata elements."
