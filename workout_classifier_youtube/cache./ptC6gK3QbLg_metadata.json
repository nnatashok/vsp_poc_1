    "I wasn&#39;t able to do workout for few days because of my exams and today I&#39;m finally a little free but suffering because of periods and thought about skipping for today but you post this video today as if saying me not to give up just because of periods. Thank you emi for pushing me forward... Again\u2764",
    "This kind of workout is what I have been looking for. This a perfect workout when I&#39;m on my period. Thanks for this Emi",
    "I wanna workout on my period but always cant find the suitable one. Thanks for this video, Emi &lt;3 Your exercises give my body huge changes and I look forward to work out everyday :) Big thanks to Emi ^^",
    "I remember first doing these on my period early June 2023, and I struggled with most, if not all exercises, mainly the ones that required good balance. What pushed me to start exercising is my goal to lose weight only. Here I am almost a year later 10kg+ down, and doing exercises primarily for my health and leisure. I now have better endurance and overall balance. Emi&#39;s videos were a kick starter for me to look after my health, and stay in shape mainly for myself, because I love myself and I want the best for myself.. Thank you Emi!",
    "This Workout is soo good. I felt very down and weak this morning and now I&#39;m full of Energy again and I don&#39;t feel uncomfortable anymore. Thanks \ud83d\udc95"
