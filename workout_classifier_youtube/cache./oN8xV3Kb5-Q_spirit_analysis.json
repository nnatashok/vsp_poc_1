  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout predominantly embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as evidenced by the title and description focusing on 'relaxation exercise,' 'anxiety reduction,' and 'stress relief.' The video content emphasizes a gentle, calming breathing technique intended to help users manage anxiety and stress, further supported by tags like 'stress relief exercise,' 'calm breathing,' and 'meditation for stress relief.' The channel specializes in relaxation practices and is known for providing accessible meditation and calm breathing exercises, aligning with the soothing and restorative qualities. Additionally, user comments highlight the calming effects and simplicity of the exercise, reinforcing its soothing nature. Other spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' were not selected due to the lack of high-energy movement, technical structure, or focus on rhythm outside of paced breathing. Overall, the video serves as a mental and physical unwinding tool, making it a precise match for Soothing & Restorative with high confidence."
