  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled '10-Day Standing Cardio Workout Challenge' primarily embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. This is supported by the use of explosive movements like 'Forward Jump', 'Split Jumps', and 'Jumping Jacks' mentioned in the description, which are typically high-intensity activities designed to elevate heart rate and burn fat. Additionally, comments such as users mentioning being 'sweaty' and having 'pumped up' heartbeats further reinforce the high-energy nature of this workout, justifying a score of 0.8.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present with a score of 0.6, as the workout involves continuous movement patterns and emphasizes a daily routine that participants have adapted to over time, allowing some rhythmic engagement. Comments about skipping breaks and experiencing a 'cardio blast' indicate an element of flow, though it is secondary to the intensity aspect.\n\nThere is some indication of a 'Structured & Disciplined' approach as well, given the 10-day challenge structure and mentions of rest times and balanced routines, meriting a score of 0.4. Users also refer to getting used to the workout over time, aligning with a disciplined practice. However, this aspect is less emphasized than the primary energetic qualities."
