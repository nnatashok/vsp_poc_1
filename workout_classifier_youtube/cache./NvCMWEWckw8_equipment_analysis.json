  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is explicitly titled \"Beginner Hip Hop Indoor Cycling Class,\" and throughout the metadata, there are numerous references to an exercise bike. The title, tags, and description frequently mention 'spin class,' 'indoor cycling,' and 'exercise bike workout,' indicating that an exercise bike is central to the workout. The description directly instructs viewers to 'get on your bike and let's kick some butt,' further confirming that the exercise bike is essential to this class. Additionally, the video comments and segments like 'SPRINTS' and 'CLIMBS' imply cycling actions that would require an exercise bike. Given this explicit and repeated emphasis, the confidence level for requiring an exercise bike is very high, at 1.0."
