  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the technique and effort difficulty analysis, the workout is perfectly aligned with beginner fitness levels given its gentle nature and focus on simple poses. The light effort required supports a beginner classification, but there is a mild alignment with intermediate users seeking stress relief who might experience slight benefits from the hip-opening focus. Still, the simplicity and calming intent align more strongly with beginner users seeking relaxation."
