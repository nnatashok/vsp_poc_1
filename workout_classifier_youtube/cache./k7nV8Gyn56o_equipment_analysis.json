  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "Based on the metadata provided, this workout video by Pamela Reif appears to require no equipment. The tags include terms like 'no equipment' and 'k\u00f6rpergewicht' (German for bodyweight), which explicitly suggest that no additional gear is necessary. The description emphasizes a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) routine that involves high-energy movements like high knees, which are typically performed as bodyweight exercises. Comments from users also suggest they are engaging in bodyweight exercises, as they reference moves like high knees and plank jumps, none of which inherently require additional equipment. Therefore, the workout is characterized as bodyweight only, with a high confidence in this classification."
