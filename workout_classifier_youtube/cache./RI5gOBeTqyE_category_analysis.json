  "categoriesExplanation": "The video 'Yoga for Bedtime for More Restful Sleep' is classified primarily under 'Yoga' with a score of 0.9 due to numerous explicit references to yoga throughout the metadata. Tags such as 'yoga for sleep,' 'yoga for sleeplessness,' 'night time yoga,' and phrases like 'gentle yoga routine for better sleep' in the description strongly indicate a yoga focus. The channel, 'Breathe and Flow,' emphasizes yoga content, further confirming this classification. \n\n'Yoga' is the central activity as it involves guided postures aimed at relaxation and improved sleep, which is reflected in the tags and subscriber comments about positive experiences related to restfulness.\n\nA secondary category is 'Stretching' with a score of 0.6, highlighted by the association of yoga and stretching in the description \u2013 \"Yoga and stretching can also help to calm you down and improve your sleep.\" This indicates that the workout includes stretching elements.\n\n'Meditation' is considered with a lower score of 0.3, as the video's goal to calm down before sleep aligns with meditative practices, although it's less explicitly stated. User comments appreciating the calming effect and a relaxing evening routine suggest this meditative element. \n\nThe classifications are highly confident given the video's clear purpose for bedtime relaxation, aligning strongly with yoga and stretching practices, and implicitly with meditation."
