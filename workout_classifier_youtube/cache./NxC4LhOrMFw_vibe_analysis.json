The description mentions words like \"preventative care,\" \"reduce inflammation,\" and \"improve flexibility,\" suggesting restorative, low-intensity attributes typical of 'The Reboot Workout,' which justifies a 0.7 score. Moreover, the brevity of the session and comments indicating its suitability for conditions like carpal tunnel suggest a gentle, restorative vibe catering to safety and comfort, akin to 'The Comfort Moves' with a score of 0.6. While 'The Zen Flow' is the strongest vibe, the video's context and user comments indicate elements of restorative and therapeutic intentions, aiding its classification."
