  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily Beginner, with an additional consideration for Intermediate. This meditation is accessible to newcomers due to its simple nature, as reflected by the metadata emphasizing morning practice and mental benefits without physical activity. However, people with some experience in mindfulness or meditation may find deeper benefits or be more quickly attuned to the practice, hence the slight consideration for Intermediate. While it's mainly for beginners, involving some breath attention may provide a challenge for complete novices, warranting a minor inclusion of the Intermediate level. Confidence in this determination is high, given the explicit focus on ease and accessibility in the video's description and tags."
