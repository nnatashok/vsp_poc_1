  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled 'Yoga For Hips & Lower Back Release', which is indicative of a yoga practice. The tags also emphasize yoga for hip and back pain, suggesting a series of floor-based exercises typical in yoga sessions. The practice is intended to release tension and cultivate balance, which often requires a supportive surface. This strongly implies the use of a yoga mat (confidence score: 0.9) for comfort and stability, as nearly all yoga routines involve poses that are performed on the ground. Additionally, a yoga mat is a standard piece of equipment recommended for such practices to ensure proper cushioning and grip, thereby enhancing the overall experience and effectiveness of the session. No other equipment is explicitly mentioned or implied in the title, description, or tags, suggesting the workout revolves around mat-oriented exercises."
