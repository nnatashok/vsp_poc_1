  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 45-minute sprint training session on a turbo trainer or static bike. The technique involves cycling form focusing on seated and standing sprints. While cycling itself is relatively straightforward, maintaining proper form, especially during intense sprints, requires coordination and balance. Professional instruction is implied by the positive comments and channel focus. Thus, an intermediate score is appropriate; however, advanced movements due to sprint coordination and form warrant a lower advanced score.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a 45-minute high-intensity sprint cycling session, suggesting significant cardiovascular and muscular effort. The description and music aim to push intensity ('sweating buckets'), and the lack of mentioned rest periods implies sustained effort. The title includes 'Sprint Training' and tags such as 'HIIT' which indicate high energy expenditure, supporting a challenging difficulty; the intense nature of sprint training yields an extreme effort difficulty score as well.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Due to the 45-minute duration and sprint intensity, a good level of fitness is required. The technique difficulty aligns with at least an intermediate level. Audience feedback reflects usability by experienced cyclists, indicating intermediate engagement. The challenging to extreme effort difficulty necessitates advanced skills for safe completion. Both levels include variations and pacing adjustments making them relevant. However, longer duration and intensity skew towards intermediate and advanced fitness levels. Beginner levels are excluded due to intensity and technical demands of maintaining sprint form."
