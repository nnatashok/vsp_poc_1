  "categoriesExplanation": "The selected categories are \"Yoga\" and \"Stretching.\" The title explicitly mentions \"Yoga Full Body Stretches,\" directly indicating a yoga session focused on stretching. The description further supports this by describing a 15-minute yoga class for \"full-body stretch\" to relieve \"tension and sore muscles,\" aligning with both yoga and stretching elements. Tags like \"yoga full body stretch,\" \"full body stretches for tension,\" and \"yoga for sore muscles\" reinforce the yoga-focused context of the video. Comments reflect the typical engagement and emotional connection associated with yoga sessions, emphasizing personal growth and positive affirmations rather than intense physical challenges, which aligns with yoga more than general stretching. Given the primary focus on yoga and full-body stretches, a score of 0.9 is assigned to Yoga, and Stretching receives a score of 0.8 due to its integral role in the workout, with moderate evidence suggesting its strong presence."
