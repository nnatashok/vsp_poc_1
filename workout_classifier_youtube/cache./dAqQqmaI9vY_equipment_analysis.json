  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a 30-minute daily yoga routine for beginners, as indicated by the title and description. Throughout the video, various yoga poses (asanas) and pranayama (breathing exercises) are practiced. Typically, such routines are performed on a mat to provide cushioning and prevent slipping. While the video does not explicitly mention a mat, the nature of the activities described, such as Pawanmuktasana (gas release pose), Sarvangasana (shoulder stand), and other poses, strongly imply its use. The confidence score is set at 0.9 due to the high likelihood that a yoga mat is needed for comfort and safety during these floor exercises."
