  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is a guided breathwork session focused on releasing DMT, involving specific breathing techniques such as 'Belly Chest Out' and breath retention as described in the video metadata. The description emphasizes the importance of being comfortable and suggests laying down, possibly with a pillow for back support, but no specific exercise equipment is mentioned or implied. The primary focus is on meditation, conscious breathing, and self-awareness, which are all components of bodyweight or no-equipment exercises. Therefore, no equipment is required for this session, as it is centered around breathwork without the need for physical exercise props or tools."
