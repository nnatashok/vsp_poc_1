  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video and description for 'Full Body Stretching Routine' are explicitly crafted to be equipment-free. The description states, 'I made this stretching routine with no equipment or gym needed!' indicating that no equipment is necessary to perform the workout. Although certain exercises might benefit from using a mat for comfort on the floor, there is no direct mention of any such need or suggestion in the metadata. User comments, typically a source of additional context regarding equipment use, also do not suggest any additional requirements. Therefore, we conclude that the workout is intended to be performed as a bodyweight routine without the necessity for any additional equipment."
