  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as a 10-minute stretch routine. Stretching generally involves minimal energy expenditure compared to other exercise modalities like cardio or strength training. The duration of 10 minutes suggests the effort is light, especially since it includes stretches which are typically low in intensity and aim to enhance recovery and mobility rather than increasing heart rate.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Due to the beginner-friendly technique and light effort level, the primary fitness level required is 'Beginner.' However, the metadata indicates that flexibility and mobility enhancement are key goals, which can also benefit users with an 'Intermediate' fitness level. Some 'Advanced' users might appreciate it for recovery and mobility purposes, especially after rigorous workouts, hence inclusion at lower confidence for these levels. The simple nature of the routine supports accessibility across these fitness levels, making it adaptable to a wide audience."
