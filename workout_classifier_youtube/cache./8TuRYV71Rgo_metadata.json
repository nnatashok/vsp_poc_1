  "title": "10 Minute Yoga Stress and Anxiety",
  "description": "This is a gentle 10 minute yoga for stress and anxiety relief. The stretches in this yoga class are focusing on the hips to help release tension within the lower body. Focusing on the hips and lower back will help to let go of physical and emotional stress as we hold a lot of our stagnant emotion within our hips. The supine twist pose however will also get into the chest helping you to create the space needed for optimal oxygen intake helping to combat anxious feelings. Being super calm and restorative, this class can be done anytime of the day but i think it makes a great bedtime yoga routine.\n\n#Yoga #10MinuteYoga #Stress\n\n & support.\n\n________________________________________\n\nFAVORITE ACTIVE WEAR: \n\nLiquido Active - Get 15% off with code: BIRDLIQUIDO https://liquidoactive.com/collections/new?p=S1EZXrrM_\n\nYoga Wheel: https://mbsy.co/LCGmf\n\nVisit My Amazon Store For All My Yoga Must Haves!:\n\n\nMusic: https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/qnrd89/\n\nJoin Honey to SAVE money while shopping online: https://www.joinhoney.com/ref/45p0vps\n\nIMPORTANT LINKS: https://linktr.ee/yogawithbird\n\nNOTE: Some links may be affiliate links that Yoga With Bird earns a small percentage of however each affiliate product is something she genuinely loves and has used herself.\n\n________________________________________\n\nYOGA CHALLENGES:\n\n30 Day Flexibility Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlybJmrSb19MiVWnve5slKTJ\n\n30 Day Restorative Yoga Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlwr-X3VF2CrZdf7rDrWH1aB\n\n7 Day Yoga For Overall Health: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlyTB8gu7I99XQkw9M85YdTk\n\n5 Day Morning Yoga Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlyjr87XsR6j4QGzyKKxwsTH\n\n5 Day Hip Flexibility Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCIrre1vyDlwAnZvLflZM-e5WWedHTBpo\n\n________________________________________\n\nABOUT THIS YOUTUBE YOGA CHANNEL\n\nFrancine Cipollone also known as her childhood nickname Bird is a 200hr Certified Yoga Teacher who found a passion for helping others find inner peace, self love and happiness through the practice of Yoga & Meditation.
