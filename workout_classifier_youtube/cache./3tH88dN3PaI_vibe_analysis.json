  "vibesExplanation": "The video, titled 'PILATES ABS FAT BURN \ud83d\udd25 Tone, Sculpt & Belly Fat Burn | 5 min Workout,' suggests an intense, targeted approach to core strengthening and fat burning. The use of 'Fat Burn' and 'Tone, Sculpt' implies a challenging workout that aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe due to the high intensity and the effort mentioned by users in the comments (e.g., \"it burns,\" \"abs were aching\"). The repetitive emphasis on achieving '6 pack abs' and targeting the 'full core' with specific exercises supports this classification. The score for 'The Warrior Workout' vibe is 0.65 due to this intensity, even though Pilates is not traditionally considered a 'Warrior' type activity, the focus on fat burn and abs through consistent effort warrants this choice.\n\n'\"The Masterclass Workout\" vibe is selected with a score of 0.6 because the workout is Pilates-based, which often focuses on form, precision, and technique. The channel description highlights Lilly Sabri's background as an APPI Pilates instructor, which reflects a focus on technique that is central to a masterclass vibe. Comments such as \"it was really hard to do yesterday but today it was much more manageable\" suggest a requirement to learn and master the workout poses or movements.\n\nOther potential vibes like \"The Meditative Grind\" were considered but excluded due to the high-intensity focus rather than a calming, endurance aspect."
