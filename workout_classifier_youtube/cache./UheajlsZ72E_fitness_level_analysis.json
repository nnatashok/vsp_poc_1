  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 10-minute fat-burning routine with no equipment, promoting accessibility. The exercises mentioned in the comments, such as butt kicks, burpees, and jumping jacks, are fundamental movements that mostly fit the beginner category but can slightly lean towards intermediate due to the inclusion of burpees. The metadata suggests basic coordination and minimal complexity, aligning with a simpler technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video title and description emphasize fat burning and high intensity, suggesting a workout intended to be physically demanding. The 10-minute duration implies moderate effort overall, but recipient comments about the intensity and need for breaks or use of ads as rest indicate that the workout may be challenging, especially for the less fit. The absence of equipment and calisthenics nature keeps energy expenditure relatively moderate, though.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout's short duration and no equipment requirement suggest beginner suitability, but comments expressing its intensity point towards at least some intermediate fitness capacity. Given the balance between technique and effort difficulties, the workout serves both beginners who may adapt and intermediates looking for a short, intense session. Multiple levels are appropriate as users can modify intensity by adjusting pace and using rest breaks effectively, reflecting reliability in requiring both beginner and intermediate fitness levels."
