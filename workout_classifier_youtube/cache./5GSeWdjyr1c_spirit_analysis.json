  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit assigned is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This classification is based on the nature of the video as a 'Guided Meditation on the Body, Space, and Awareness' which fits the description of a session focused on relaxation and stress reduction. The metadata highlights a mindfulness practice meant to transform \"stressful situations and challenging emotions\" and to engage with the present moment, emphasizing a calming and restorative experience.\n\nThe channel description further reinforces this theme as it portrays Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche as a skilled teacher in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, which is typically focused on meditation and inner peace. The comments from viewers also express personal transformation and emotional relief, indicating the restorative nature of the session.\n\nA secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm,' is suggested with a low confidence score of 0.2, as the practice involves continuous, mindful attention and awareness that aligns with guided flow but lacks the strong musical or physical coordination elements seen in other 'Flow & Rhythm' activities.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the meditative and calming focus of the session, which lacks intense physical exertion or sports-specific skills."
