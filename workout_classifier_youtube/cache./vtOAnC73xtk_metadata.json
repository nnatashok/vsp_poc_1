    "It\u2019s not a coincidence that you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re protected and guided by the universe. You deserve all the best, you are worthy and enough. I know it hurts right now but i promise you , it\u2019s gonna pass and you will get stronger. This is just something that is getting you to the best version of yourself , to the life you have always wanted. I used to have no belief in myself, I was struggling with self-love but it passed. I promise it does pass. I love you. Keep going, don\u2019t give up. It\u2019s a journey. Keep healing yourself. And if you make a mistake, don\u2019t give yourself anger. The little innocent kid inside you doesn\u2019t need anger, it needs love in order to heal. Heal it with love and understanding. I love you. You will get to where you want to be. \u2764\ufe0f\u2728 I believe in you !<br>Note: I regularly read your comments. I\u2019m so grateful, thank you for your beautiful comments! \ud83e\udec2\u2764\ufe0f",
    "My dream as humanity awakens is that school children will learn meditation as part of their daily activities and spiritual education as well as art and creativity will be an integral part if their learning along with math, reading etc. Balanced right-left brain development is the formula for creating geniuses",
