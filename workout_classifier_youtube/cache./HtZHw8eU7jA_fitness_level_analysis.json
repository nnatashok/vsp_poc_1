  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The content is specifically targeted towards beginners, as evident from the description and user comments praising its accessibility for those who are physically inactive or returning to exercise after long periods. The technique and effort difficulties both align closely with a beginner profile, suggesting a beginner required fitness level with high confidence. Intermediate and advanced levels are included due to the possibility of adjusting exercise pace and resistance (e.g., if users have additional equipment). While the primary target is beginners, the flexibility involved allows broader applicability."
