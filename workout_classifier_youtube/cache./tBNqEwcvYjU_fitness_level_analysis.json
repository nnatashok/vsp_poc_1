  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is explicitly designed for beginners, focusing on interval walking using a treadmill. Movement complexity is minimal as it primarily involves walking at varying speeds, a basic and straightforward action requiring little coordination or technical skill. The instructor provides form tips, but the simplicity of walking makes this accessible to those new to exercise, confirmed by both the video's title and description which emphasize its suitability for beginners.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Effort difficulty leans towards light to moderate based on the interval nature of the workout. Although walking is generally a low-effort activity, the intervals involve speed variations from 2.0 to 4.0 MPH, which can increase overall cardiovascular demand, especially for those not used to any form of exercise. The overall structure with regular resting periods supports a light to moderate exertion level. Viewer comments suggest perceived increasing ease over time, asserting it as a moderately demanding task for complete beginners.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Primarily aimed at beginners, the workout remains approachable with potential adjustments mentioned in comments like slower speeds to fit personal capabilities, pointing to some flexibility in execution. The 21-minute duration slightly reduces the level's exclusivity to complete novices, inviting slightly more conditioned individuals (intermediate) seeking a light activity. This workout is achievable by beginners working at their own pace, supported by the channel's focus on making fitness accessible to everyone as echoed in both the description and comments."
