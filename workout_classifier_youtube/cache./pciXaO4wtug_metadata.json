    "I love your style of teaching!  It is so refreshing to find yoga instructors who don\u2019t stop the flow to talk.  I absolutely loved this stretch and feel amazing after this video!",
    "I enjoyed practicing with you this morning.  Have a blessed day.",
    "I always feel better after your workouts. Chair yoga is harder than I thought but it does stretch every muscle.",
    "I was hesitant to take the class, thinking it&#39;s just for &#39;old&#39; people (I&#39;m 64). I was surprised how much stretching could be done in a chair! Thank you for another excellent class. Your calm instruction and lovely piano music set a wonderful tone.",
    "Always feel energized after a yoga session"
