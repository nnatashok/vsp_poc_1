Always practice sitting or lying down in a safe environment. Tinnitus symptoms may appear as a result of pushing too forcefully during the breathing exercise. If this happens, reduce the number of practice rounds and soften your breaths. It\u2019s important to increase gradually, not forcefully.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:32 - Round One\n3:52 - Round Two\n7:40 - Round Three\n11:59 - Round Four\n16:48 - Round Five",
