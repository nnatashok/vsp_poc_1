  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a 20-minute full body HIIT workout by Joe Wicks, as indicated by the metadata including the title and description. The description lists various bodyweight exercises such as 'walkouts with press up', 'squat pulses', 'bear crawls', and 'burpees', which are all exercises typically performed without equipment. The comments support this as participants discuss the effectiveness of the workout without mentioning equipment. Although the tags include 'kettlebell', there's no evidence in the description or title that kettlebells are actually used in this specific workout, resulting in a very low confidence for including them. Overall, based on the provided metadata, it is clear that this is a bodyweight-only workout that requires no specific equipment."
