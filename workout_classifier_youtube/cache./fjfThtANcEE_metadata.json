    "Maddie, heyy!! I wanted to share my experience with you because of how big of a part you were in my journey!! I was 68 kg in Jan and now I&#39;m 51 (I&#39;m 17)!! I still do your dance party workouts, they are so fun and i LOVE the energy expenditure in them!! I honestly dont know how to thank you enough, but thank you &lt;3<br>To anybody reading this: believe me, you CAN do it, I never believed that I could but I did. AND SO. CAN. YOU. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa",
    "Loved the stretches \u2764 but also the soft and sweet song in the background. This class is not just good for the body, it is a master piece for the soul \u2764 thank you so much, I really appreciate all your work and dedication to this project \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96",
    "Literally just what I&#39;ve been needing!",
    "I&#39;ve been doing your workouts and stretches for 5 years now, and they really help me control my chronic pain! I&#39;d love it if you made a foam roller stretch &amp; cool-down video, it&#39;d be super helpful to use after workouts!! :) thank you for everything you do",
    "I was doing your full body workout when this video popped up, so I&#39;ve just done it! Thank you so much, Maddie! You make my life and my workout journey so much happier! A lot of love from Russia \u2764"
