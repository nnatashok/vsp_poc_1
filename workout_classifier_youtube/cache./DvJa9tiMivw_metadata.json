    "I&#39;m doing this 20-30 minutes after  my breakfast, because when i woke up i just meditate and do a 10 minute walk, then make myself a breakfast, rest for about 30 minutes and just eat, then have this amazing light morning stretching and i like it so much, it&#39;s just perfect! Thank you, Mrs!",
    "im not kidding, this routine SAVED my knees!! i had a bad knee injury from being a nanny who pulls kids around a city all day in a wagon. it would constantly crackle, especially on stairs. and it hurt constantly. started doing this around a month ago and i just noticed today how much less crackling there is. and no pain!! thank you so much!"
