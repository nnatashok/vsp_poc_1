    "I&#39;ve done this 3 times now and the boat pose stuff kills me everytime \ud83d\ude02",
    "Of all the stretching and mobility videos on YouTube yours are my favorite. They\u2019re direct to the point no cheesy commentary. A image showing what stretch is next. Time to get into position. As always fantastic video!",
    "The motions are easy to follow. It helps me with back injury and sciatica pain. Thanks you! "
