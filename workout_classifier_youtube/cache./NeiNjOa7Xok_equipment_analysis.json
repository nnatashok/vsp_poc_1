  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video explicitly states \"No equipment needed\" in the description, which is further supported by the nature of the routines listed in the video. The exercises involve stretches and poses typically performed using one's body weight, such as 'Standing Side Stretch', 'Low Lunge', 'Cat-Cow', and 'Child\u2019s Pose to Cobra'. These exercises do not typically require any additional equipment like mats, dumbbells, or bands, and are often performed on the floor or standing without support. Additionally, the comments and tags focus on stretching, flexibility, and pilates, without any mention of equipment, further confirming that this routine is bodyweight only."
