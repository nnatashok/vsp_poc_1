  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is 'Yoga' with a high confidence score of 0.95. This is based on several clear indicators: the title 'Full Body Flow | 20-Minute Yoga Practice,' the channel name 'Yoga With Adriene,' multiple tags like 'yoga at home,' 'morning yoga,' and repeated mentions of yoga in the description, emphasizing a 'Full Body Yoga Flow.' Additionally, detailed in the description is the synchronization of breath with movement, which further supports this being a yoga workout focused on flow and breath work, common in vinyasa yoga practices.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Meditation' with a moderate score of 0.5. This is due to the description phrase 'create a moving meditation' and comments like \"appreciate where you are\" which indicate a mindfulness aspect typically associated with meditation practices, although it is not the central focus of the video.\n\nOther categories, such as 'Stretching' or 'Breathing Exercises,' were considered but excluded due to the explicit focus on a yoga flow routine rather than purely stretching or breath-focused exercises. The presence of these elements within the context of a yoga flow is typical and does not override the primary classification."
