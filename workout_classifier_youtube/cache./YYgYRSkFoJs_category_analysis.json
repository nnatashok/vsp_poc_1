  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video titled '20 MIN FULL BODY TONING & STRENGTH (Total Body Workout At Home)' categorically falls under 'Weight workout' due to explicit mention of using 'DUMBBELLS' in the description, indicating strength training with weights is a central component (\u001evidence score 0.9 due to strong alignment with free weight training). The repetition of phrases such as 'full body dummbell workout' and 'full body workout with weights' in the tags further supports this categorization. Additionally, the inclusion of 'Mat' as a category is justified by the reference to an exercise mat link in the description, suggesting that the workout may also involve exercises performed on a mat (evidence score 0.6, acknowledging a likely but not definitive presence). Potential categories like 'Body weight' and 'HIIT' were considered but excluded due to lack of sufficient evidence for exclusive reliance on body weight or high-intensity intervals."
