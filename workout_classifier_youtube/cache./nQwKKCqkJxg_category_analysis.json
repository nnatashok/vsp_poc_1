  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is clearly 'Yoga', as indicated by the title 'Gentle Seated Yoga For Beginners & All Levels | 30 Minute Practice' and supported by the channel name 'Jess Yoga', which focuses on yoga practices. The description also emphasizes yoga and notes that it's suitable for beginners and all levels, mentioning phrases like 'yoga practice' and 'yoga class'. Comments further reinforce this by sharing experiences of starting yoga through this video. Hence, the score for 'Yoga' is 1.0, reflecting its centrality.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Stretching', with a score of 0.7. The description mentions 'floor stretches', and user comments describe feeling stretches in the body, indicating that stretching is a significant component, though within the context of a yoga practice. The 'gentle' and 'slow-paced' nature mentioned in both the description and comments suggests stretching is a strong element, but since it's within a yoga framework, it's not the primary focus, hence the slightly lower score than yoga itself."
