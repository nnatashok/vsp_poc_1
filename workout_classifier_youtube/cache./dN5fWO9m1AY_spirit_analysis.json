  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is categorized primarily as \"Flow & Rhythm\" due to the Pilates style, which is inherently focused on smooth and continuous body movements, as indicated by terms like \"full body Pilates workout\" and \"mat Pilates.\" The title and tags, such as \"feel good Pilates,\" emphasize coordination and mind-body connection, supporting a high confidence score of 0.85. \"Structured & Disciplined\" is also relevant, considering Pilates' precise and methodical nature, likely following a routine with specific technical goals. The precise teaching method noted in comments and the channel's dedication to proper movement technique justify a score of 0.65. \"Soothing & Restorative\" is suggested by user comments highlighting relaxation and mental peace, describing the workout's calming effect with terms like \"peace in my day to day life\" and \"relaxes me to another level.\" This suggests a moderate presence, warranting a 0.55 score. Other spirits are less applicable given the focus on indoor, low-impact Pilates."
