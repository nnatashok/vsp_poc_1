  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The primary equipment required for this workout is a chair, as indicated by the title \"Chair Yoga Stretch for Beginners, Seniors & Everyone\" and further supported by tags such as \"Chair yoga,\" \"Chair stretch,\" and \"Seated yoga.\" The description explicitly states that the yoga workout is \"all done in the comfort of a chair,\" suggesting that the chair is central to performing the exercises intended. The confidence level is very high (1.0) because the metadata consistently emphasizes the chair as the foundational equipment for this yoga routine."
