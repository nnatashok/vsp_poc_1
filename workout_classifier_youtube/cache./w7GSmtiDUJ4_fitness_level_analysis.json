  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is part of a yoga series, typically involving some foundational poses. The description mentions adding 'new vocabulary', suggesting some progression in technique, but likely not exceeding intermediate yoga poses due to the channel's inclusive approach. Additionally, the tags such as 'home yoga' and 'yoga practice' imply beginner or slightly more complex poses, aligning with beginner to intermediate levels.",

User comments reflect a calming and soothing experience rather than a high-intensity workout. Considering the typical nature of yoga routines on this channel, the effort level likely ranges from light, suitable for gentle exercise, to moderate, for users who engage more energetically.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Yoga With Adriene caters to all levels, which is reflected in the channel's description and user feedback. The technique and effort difficulties align well with beginners having access to foundational yoga poses, while the inclusion of potentially more complex poses as indicated by 'new vocabulary' justifies the inclusion of intermediate level. Advanced is included to account for users who may wish to intensify the practice, though it's less likely intended for elite practitioners."
