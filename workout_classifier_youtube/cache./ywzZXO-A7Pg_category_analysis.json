  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is titled '30 MIN PILATES FOR BEGINNERS || Full Body Workout (No Equipment)', which explicitly indicates the focus on Pilates. The word 'Pilates' is central in the title and reiterated in the tags (e.g., 'pilates workout,' 'full body pilates workout') and description (e.g., 'Full Body Pilates Workout for Beginners'), justifying a score of 1 for the Pilates category. The description notes 'No equipment needed, just you and your mat,' and the tags include 'mat,' suggesting the exercises are performed primarily on a mat, warranting inclusion with a score of 0.6 for the Mat category. The channel's content and comments reflect a Pilates focus, with several comments expressing appreciation for the beginner-friendly nature, consistency with Pilates, without strong evidence for other categories."
