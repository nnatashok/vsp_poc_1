  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title and description both explicitly mention that the workout requires no equipment, emphasizing 'NO EQUIPMENT' in the title. However, the description does state, 'All you will need for this ab workout is your mat!' This clearly indicates that a mat is required to perform this workout, likely for comfort and support during floor exercises such as 'TABLE TOP CRUNCH' and 'SIDE PLANK OBLIQUE LIFTS'. The repeated emphasis on the minimal equipment needed further strengthens the confidence score of 1.0 for the mat. No other equipment is mentioned or implied, confirming that the workout is primarily bodyweight-focused with the mat as the sole requirement."
