  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen for this video is \"Stretching\" with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is based on multiple metadata elements explicitly highlighting stretching, such as the title \"Relaxing Full Body Stretching Routine for Stress & Anxiety Relief, Seated\" and repeated use of the word \"stretching\" in tags and description. This indicates a strong focus on stretching exercises, targeting stress and anxiety relief through stretching, with phrases like \"full body stretch\" and \"seated stretches\" reinforcing this. \n\nThe secondary category considered is \"Mat\" with a lower score of 0.4. Although the video is labeled as a seated routine, which typically correlates with activities done on a mat, the emphasis here is more on the stretching aspect rather than general floor-based exercises. The potential overlap with seated exercises justifies its inclusion but not with a high score since the main focus isn't typical mat-based exercises without equipment or specific mat-related movements."
