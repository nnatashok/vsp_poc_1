  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is characterized as a 'STRONG YOGA & STRETCH' routine, indicating a blend of dynamic and controlled movements synonymous with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The use of terms like 'flow,' 'yoga stretch,' 'morning yoga flow,' and 'full body stretch' in the tags and description further supports this classification. The inclusion of 'low impact' and an emphasis on mind-body connection is key to this spirit, leading to a high confidence score of 0.8.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is strongly supported by phrases like 'help you increase your mobility and flexibility,' 'feel super relaxed at the end,' and mentioning 'rest day workout,' which emphasizes recovery and relaxation. Comments about using this routine on days when energy is low, along with 'recovery days are just as important' further reinforce this spirit, resulting in a score of 0.9.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the clear low-impact, non-repetitive, and recovery-focused nature of the workout. The confidence level is very high given the explicit indications within both the metadata and viewer comments."
