  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata from the video indicates that no equipment is needed for this 10-minute cardio workout. The description explicitly states \"no equipment needed,\" reinforcing this. Additionally, tags such as \"indoor walking for weight loss\" and \"low impact cardio workout for beginners\" suggest the workout is designed to emphasize accessibility and minimal setup, which aligns with a bodyweight-only exercise routine. Comments from viewers do not mention any equipment use, further supporting the conclusion that the workout utilizes only bodyweight exercises. Thus, I conclude with high confidence that this workout requires no equipment."
