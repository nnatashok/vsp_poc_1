  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a seated full body stretching routine aimed at stress and anxiety relief, as indicated by the title and description. The routine involves gentle stretching exercises like knee extensions, upper arm jumping jacks, and various seated stretches for different muscle groups. The description specifically mentions that the stretches are performed in a seated position and does not mention any external equipment beyond a chair, which is typically needed for seated exercises. The comments and tags reinforce the perspective that these exercises are done while seated, making body support the only implicit requirement. Consequently, this workout appears to be primarily about using a chair for seating, which is often an inherent aspect of such routines. Therefore, the equipment required is a chair, implicitly suggested by the need for seated positions, but no additional workout equipment is explicitly needed. As such, the confidence score for any other equipment is 0, suggesting bodyweight exercises in a seated format without additional tools."
