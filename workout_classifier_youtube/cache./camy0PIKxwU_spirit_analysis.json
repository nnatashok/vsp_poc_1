  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' due to several compelling factors from both the title and description, as well as viewer comments. The mention of 'gentle yoga routine', 'beginner friendly', 'slow and steady', 'release tension', and 'nurturing practice' explicitly suggest a focus on relaxation and recovery, which are key attributes of the Soothing & Restorative spirit. Additionally, comments from users highlight the relaxing nature of the session, the lack of music, and the emphasis on feeling rested and restored, reinforcing this categorization, warranting a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe secondary classification is 'Flow & Rhythm', as indicated by the term 'yoga flow' in the description and the channel's emphasis on vinyasa, which traditionally involves rhythmic and continuous movement. The instructor's background in playful vinyasa flow, emphasizing movement's creativity and effectiveness, supports a moderate score of 0.6 in this category. The absence of intense or structured elements in the title and comments leads to the exclusion of other spirits."
