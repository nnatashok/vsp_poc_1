  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is described as the 'Scientific 7 Minute Workout,' indicating it follows the format of the popular high-intensity interval training (HIIT) regimen. The tags include 'hiit,' 'cardio workout,' and 'scientific 7 minute workout,' which strongly suggest that it involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by rest periods, characteristic of HIIT workouts. Therefore, it receives a score of 0.75 for HIIT.\n\nThe title explicitly mentions 'Bodyweight Only Total Body Workout,' and the tags reiterate this with 'bodyweight workout,' suggesting that the exercises are performed without equipment, relying solely on body weight for resistance. This is typical of bodyweight workouts, earning a score of 0.7 for Body weight. The high view count and positive comments indicate it is well-received as a workout people repeat and find effective.\n\nNo equipment or apparatus like weights is mentioned, which excludes categories such as 'Weight workout.' While there is a mention of cardio, the focus on short, intense body-weight exercises aligns more with HIIT than purely cardio, hence cardio was not given a direct category."
