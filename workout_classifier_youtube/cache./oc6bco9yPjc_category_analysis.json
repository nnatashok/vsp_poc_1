  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Body weight' with high confidence (score 0.9) due to the explicit focus on performing 100 squats, as detailed in the title 'Guided 100 Squat Workout!' and the description, which emphasizes lower body fitness primarily through body weight squats. Squats are classic body weight exercises, and there's no mention of using equipment like weights or resistance bands that would suggest a presence of other categories such as 'Weight workout'. Additionally, the overall structure of the video, being a follow-along session, reinforces the classification of body weight exercises. The secondary category 'Other' is assigned a low score (0.2) to account for any non-specific or general fitness themes present in the video content, such as alternative exercises hinted at in the description, though these are not described in detail. No other categories, such as 'HIIT' or 'Mat', strongly apply as there's no evidence of intervals, considerable movement types, or mat-based exercises beyond squats."
