  "spiritsExplanation": "The dominant workout spirit for this meditation video is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 1. The title, '10 MIN Guided Meditation To Clear Your Mind & Start New Positive Habits,' and the description emphasize mental clarity, grounding, and creating a 'perfect track for success.' This clearly indicates a focus on relaxation and mental restoration. Furthermore, the channel, Boho Beautiful Yoga, is known for promoting mindful living and offers a variety of meditation content, further reinforcing the soothing and restorative nature of the video.\n\nWhile the primary focus is on recovery and restoration, there is a mild element of 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the structured nature of guided meditation and the continual flow of mental practice over the session's duration. However, since the primary focus is calming and meditative rather than dynamic movement, this spirit is less prominent, hence receiving a lower score of 0.4.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are inapplicable due to the lack of physical intensity or athletic elements in the content."
