  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Stretching' with a very high score of 0.9. This is strongly supported by the video title '20 Minute Full Body Stretch | Deep Stretch for Total Body', which emphasizes the workout focus on stretching, and the description that mentions 'deep full body stretch routine.' Additionally, the workout overview provides a list of stretching exercises, such as 'Seated Hamstring Stretch,' 'Butterfly Stretch,' and 'Cobra,' that are characteristic of a stretching session. The tags further reinforce this with terms like 'stretch routine' and 'stretching exercises.'\n\nThe 'Yoga' category is also included with a moderate score of 0.4. While not explicitly stated as a yoga session, some of the mentioned stretches like 'Cobra' and presence of mindfulness elements make it somewhat related to yoga practice. Moreover, the channel's focus includes yoga, aligning with the type of content they produce.\n\nPotential other categories like 'Pilates' were considered, given the channel's name and description, but the video's specific focus on stretching exercises was more prevalent and dominant in this workout."
