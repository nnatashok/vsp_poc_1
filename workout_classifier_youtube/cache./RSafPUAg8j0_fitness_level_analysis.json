  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is classified as Beginner and Intermediate. The workout appears to focus on simple bodyweight movements like pushups, which are straightforward but can be modified to increase complexity. The use of the term 'Calisthenics' suggests bodyweight exercises that can range from simple to moderately complex. Comments like '100 pushup routine' imply basic exercises accessible to beginners, yet may offer intermediate variations.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Effort difficulty is rated as Moderate to Challenging. The workout is brief at only 5 minutes, suggesting lower overall effort. However, the mention of 'chest workout' and related comments indicating intensive routines ('100 pushup routine') suggest a higher energy expenditure. The short duration but intense nature for muscle engagement supports this dual difficulty rating.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is classified across Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. The workout targets chest muscles with bodyweight exercises, largely beginner-friendly. Intermediate and Advanced levels are supported by the potential for intensity increase and modifications that provide greater challenge ('100 pushup routine' implies it can scale). Despite the short duration, the focus on effectiveness ('huge gains!') and intensity in user feedback suggests a broader fitness applicability."
