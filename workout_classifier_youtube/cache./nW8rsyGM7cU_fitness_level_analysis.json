  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is characterized as an 'Intermediate Dance Ride' which suggests the inclusion of rhythmic and coordinated movements typical of rhythm cycling classes. These can require a moderate degree of coordination and balance, hence the higher score for 'Intermediate'. However, since it's a cycling workout, the fundamental technique is pedaling, which is generally not complex, allowing a 'Beginner' score due to the repetitive and straightforward nature of cycling, albeit with some complexity due to the rhythm aspect.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 30-minute duration of the workout suggests a significant, but not extreme, effort demand. The use of terms like 'Dance Ride' implies continuous movement and potential for elevated heart rates, but the lack of explicit intensity cues in the description suggests a moderate to challenging effort appropriate for individuals accustomed to some endurance activity. The popularity and positive feedback from viewers indicate it is manageable for those with at least some experience in cycling workouts.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the intermediate technique and effort difficulty, the workout primarily targets those with some cycling experience ('Intermediate'). However, the description and comments do not deter complete beginners from participating, thus a 'Beginner' level is possible although may be challenging. Enthusiastic feedback and popularity suggest the workout appeals to a broad audience including 'Advanced' due to the rhythmic complexity and engagement level. Consequently, it spans multiple fitness levels, especially given the flexibility in intensity that rhythm cycling can offer."
