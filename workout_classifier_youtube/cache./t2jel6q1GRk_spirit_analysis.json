  "spiritsExplanation": "The video 'Quick Morning Stretching Routine For Flexibility, Mobility, And Stiffness!' predominantly embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This is strongly supported by language in the title and description suggesting gentle movements aimed at alleviating tight muscles and stiffness. Phrases like 'gentle yet effective stretches,' 'transform your mornings,' and 'pain-free morning' emphasize recovery and relaxation, thus earning a high score of 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit scores 0.5, as the routine involves continuous movements designed to improve flexibility and mobility, evident from descriptions of a 'total-body stretching routine' and specific stretches performed in sequence. However, it fits this spirit only moderately since the primary focus remains on restorative benefits rather than coordinating movement patterns.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the emphasis on gentle stretches over vigorous activity or athletic performance. Hence, the confidence in the selected spirits is 0.85, based on clear indications in the metadata."
