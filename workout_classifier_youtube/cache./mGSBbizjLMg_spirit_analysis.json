  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is strongly classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to the keywords 'Tabata,' and 'HIIT,' both of which suggest a fast-paced, high-intensity workout that is aimed at pushing limits. The top comment mentioning the workout is 'really hard' supports the intense nature of the session, and the description suggests calorie burn, a common high-energy workout goal. The 60-minute duration further emphasizes its intensity. \n\nThe spirit 'Structured & Disciplined' is also relevant with a score of 0.7 because Tabata training involves a specific timing protocol, indicating a structured approach to the workout. The video is designed as a systematic upper body workout focusing on 'back, shoulders, and arms,' which adds to its disciplined nature as it targets specific muscle groups. FitnessBlender's channel description of offering 'smart and effective workout programs' underlines the structured format of their workouts.\n\nFlow & Rhythm, Soothing & Restorative, Sport & Agility, and Outdoor & Adventure were excluded due to the absence of elements such as music-driven flow, a focus on relaxation, sport-specific skills, or outdoor settings."
