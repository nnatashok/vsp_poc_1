    "Thank you for helping change me life this year and recover from cfs.",
    "As a yoga teacher who practices yoga Nidra regularly, I feel compelled to tell you how immensely restful and beautiful this practice was. Simply blissful. Namaste.",
    "Thank you !  I do a half hour to an hour of Yoga Nidra a day , using your guided meditation.  I am 73 , a long time meditator and yogi , and I drive Uber late night in San Francisco.  That upsets my sleep cycle, so I use Yoda nidra as an excellent aid to balance that all out , esp if I don\u2019t get enough sleep.",
    "In this meditation I drifted away a little, I felt my deceased wife rest her forehead against mine the way we used to. I needed that I needed the gentle tears on my cheek.",
    "As a sleep deprived mother with a newborn. This has saved my life! Thank you \ud83d\ude4f"
