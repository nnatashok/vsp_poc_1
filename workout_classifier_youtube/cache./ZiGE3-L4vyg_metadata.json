    "This is by far the best training videos for indoor cycling. No annoying music. Simple and positive directions with no yelling.",
    "My Peloton app is making me upgrade after using the app for 26 weeks in a row.(in order to continue). It&#39;s ridiculous! am so happy I found you guys! Canceling my Peloton app. No more watching instructors dancing and cursing. Just pure fitness. Thank you!",
    "That piece of pink paper you see flying about at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiGE3-L4vyg&amp;t=1396\">23:16</a> is actually my soul leaving my body. <br><br>Love this workout.",
    "the British accent made the workout even more pleasurable. I guess will get addicted to it (the workout \ud83d\ude00)",
    "I started doing this a few times a week a month ago to get my fitness level up and to shift some weight and it was hard work.  Now I do the entire thing twice in a row, 6 days a week. 700 calories burned in just under 1 hour.  Not too shabby."
