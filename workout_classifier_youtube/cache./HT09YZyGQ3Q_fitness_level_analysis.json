  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is described as a 'gentle yoga practice for mixed levels' and a 'full body sequence guided at a slow and steady pace,' indicating relatively simple postures suitable for beginners with possible intermediates-level aspects, such as incorporating various postures that might require some mindfulness and balance. Comments referencing specific stretches suggest slightly more than basic yoga positions, supporting a high Beginner and moderate Intermediate classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique difficulty suggests simplicity, allowing even those new to yoga to participate effectively. The 25-minute duration pushes the required fitness level slightly more toward Intermediate as beginners might find it lengthy. However, the gentle nature and relaxation focus make it highly suitable for beginners, with Intermediate practitioners benefiting from possible deeper engagement in the stretches."
