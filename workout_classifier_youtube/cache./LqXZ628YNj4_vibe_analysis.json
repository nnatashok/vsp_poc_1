  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of this workout, 'The Zen Flow,' is strongly indicated by the title and description emphasizing a 'juicy breath-centric morning flow,' aiming to cultivate a 'peaceful mind' and support overall 'mobility.' These elements suggest a grounding, intentional practice focused on breath-centered movement, which aligns perfectly with 'The Zen Flow.' The inclusion of terms like 'peaceful inner feelings' and 'peaceful mind,' along with the yoga style, underscores the meditative and calming qualities of the workout, justifying a high confidence level of 0.9.\n\nThe secondary vibe, 'The Deep Recharge,' is suggested by the language in both the description and comments discussing a supportive and refreshing start to the day. The phrase 'cultivate and manifest' implies a rejuvenating experience, while user experiences shared in comments, such as feeling life-changing impacts, align with a gentle nervous system reset, valued in 'The Deep Recharge.' However, because the emphasis seems slightly more on mindful flow than purely on rejuvenation, this vibe receives a lower score of 0.6."
