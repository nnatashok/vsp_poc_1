  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Due to the very simple movements in the short timeframe, the routine is suitable for beginners, confirmed by comments and explicit mentions like 'beginner stretching.' However, the inclusion of yoga elements means slightly more flexible or coordinated beginners might find it more beneficial, so intermediate could feel involved but without intense challenge. The short duration and light effort requirement support lower fitness level classification."
