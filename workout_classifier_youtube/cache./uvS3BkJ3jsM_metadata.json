    "Thank you for this Stronger together series. I completed it last week and thought today that I needed to come back here. I don&#39;t really like to post comments but you deserve to be thanked for your work, so here it is: big thank you!",
    "I LOVE this &quot;Stronger Together Series&quot;!!  ( It&#39;s nice to see someone workout alongside you who isn&#39;t quite as super-human... but your friend is still very strong and fit! )  Thanks for a great workout!   :-)",
    "Love this older stuff! Have a goal of completing all your videos at least once!",
    "The 20 min HIIT with your two are my favourites",
    "This weeks workouts were amazing! I look forward to this one. Your friend is a badass too!!"
