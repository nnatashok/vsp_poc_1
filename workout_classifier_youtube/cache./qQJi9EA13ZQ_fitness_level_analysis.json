  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is characterized by standing movements with an emphasis on lower abs, described as 'beginner friendly' in the description. The lack of jumping and low impact exercises suggest basic movements, aligning primarily with beginner technique difficulty. However, the use of a Tabata format, which includes 30 seconds of intense activity with 10 seconds of rest, requires some coordination and awareness, moderately increasing complexity to an intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout has a duration of over 30 minutes and uses a Tabata format with 30 seconds of intense exercise followed by 10 seconds of rest. While the setup is lower impact and primarily standing, the reduced rest intervals and allusion to high intensity ('pushing it to the LIMIT') suggest significant cardiorespiratory effort, placing the workout between moderate and challenging effort levels. The described calorie burn and intensity level (9/10) reinforce the significant energy expenditure.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique difficulty and effort level indicate that while the workout is primarily intended to be beginner-friendly due to its standing, low-impact nature, the Tabata format and significant cardiovascular demand make it suitable for intermediate users. The 30-minute duration also suggests a baseline level of fitness is needed for sustainability, edging towards advanced for those completely new to exercise. YouTube user comments highlight transformative results, suggesting effectiveness across multiple fitness levels."
