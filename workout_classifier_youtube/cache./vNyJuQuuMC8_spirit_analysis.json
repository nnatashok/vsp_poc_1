The score of 0.75 reflects a strong match.\n\n'Soothing & Restorative' is the primary spirit assigned, given the description of the session being 'gentle', 'meditative', and its emphasis on 'regulating the nervous system'. Yoga is often restorative, focusing on recovery and relaxation, which is echoed in the user comments appreciating its gentle nature.
