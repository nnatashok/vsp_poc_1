  "description": "This HIIT workout is a low impact, fast walking workout continuing on from Series 3.  Today is a tougher workout for those who feel ready for the challenge.  We are doing longer intervals which you ALL can manage, depending on how fast you go during the fast interval.  Cater the pace of your fast walk or jog according to what you can do.  We will start with a 10 minute warm-up then walk or jog as fast as we can for two full minutes.  We will then slow the pace down for one full minute.  To make this workout your own, please pace yourself.  If you find the two minutes is too challenging, then find a pace you CAN manage for the full two minutes.  It might mean slowing your pace down a little bit and that is TOTALLY okay.  Instead of jogging, you might need to walk.  Over time, your pace will pick up.  You can see in this video at times I am going faster than other times because I simply got tired and needed to slow my pace down.   I picked it up again when I could.  That is the wonderful thing about this workout.  You can make it your own and everybody will see positive changes.\n\nIdeally, try to do interval training twice a week, strength training twice a week and on the other days choose whatever cardio you enjoy.  I'll be putting out two optional interval workouts so you can choose which one you want to do each week.  \n\nIf you enjoyed the workout, please subscribe and write a comment!  I'd love to hear from you!\n\nWishing you improved health!\nJules\n\n#intervaltraining #walkingworkout #walkathome\n\nDisclaimer:  You should always consult your physician before starting any 'Improved Health' fitness program or any other fitness program.
