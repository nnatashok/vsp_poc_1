  "vibesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as \"The Reboot Workout\" with a score of 0.9. This classification is supported by the emphasis on mobility stretches aimed at relieving muscle tension and improving joint mobility, which aligns with the \"low stress, total-body refresh\" aspect of the Reboot vibe. The description specifically mentions a guided full-body mobility exercise that aims to relieve muscle tension and improve the range of motion, key characteristics of a Reboot Workout.\n\nAdditionally, \"The Zen Flow\" is a moderately fitting secondary vibe with a score of 0.6 due to the breath-centered, intentional flow of movement inherent in mobility stretching. Although the video is centered around physical therapy and mobility rather than typical slow-paced yoga or tai chi, the intentional and grounding nature of the stretches supports elements of a Zen Flow.\n\nThe confidence in this classification is quite high (0.85), as the tags and descriptions clearly point to mobility enhancement and stress relief, hallmarks of a Reboot Workout. Other potential vibes, such as \"The Foundation Builder\" or \"The Meditative Grind\", were considered but excluded due to a lack of emphasis on strengthening weak points or lengthy endurance training, respectively."
