  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is titled \"The Ultimate Stretching Routine After Any Workout (Post Workout Routine)\" which strongly indicates its primary focus on post-exercise stretching. The description and tags further reinforce this, with phrases like \"ultimate stretching routine,\" \"post workout stretches,\" and \"gentle stretching.\" This evidence supports a high score of 0.9 for the Stretching category, as stretching is clearly the central element of the video. \n\nThe channel, Breathe and Flow, is predominantly focused on yoga content, which is reflected in the tags such as \"vinyasa yoga\" and \"yoga practice.\" Additionally, the description mentions that the video activates a relaxed nervous system state, typical of yoga's focus on mind-body awareness. The presence of yoga elements, along with the channel's specialization, suggests a Yoga classification with a score of 0.75. This accounts for the integration of yoga principles in the stretching routine. While the video is not exclusively a yoga session, it contains significant yoga influences."
