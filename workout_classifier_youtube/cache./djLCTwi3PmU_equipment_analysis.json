  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a yoga flow session, described in the title and metadata as \"20 Min Morning Yoga Flow\" which typically requires a yoga mat for comfort and safety during floor exercises and poses. The description mentions a full body yoga sequence, often best performed on a mat to prevent slipping and provide cushioning on hard surfaces. The focus on poses like hip openers, backbends, and balances further supports the need for a mat to maintain stability and comfort. Although no specific equipment is mentioned in terms of mats, the nature of the activity strongly implies its use, resulting in a very high confidence score of 0.9 for a mat being necessary."
