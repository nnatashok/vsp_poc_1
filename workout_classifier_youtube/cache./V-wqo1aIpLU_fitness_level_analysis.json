  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features exercises like renegade rows, dead stop snatch, and single leg glute bridge, which require some coordination and form awareness, suggesting an intermediate technique difficulty. Comments also indicate some users found the Tate press new and required adaptation, hinting at movements that are not necessarily for beginners. The presence of exercises involving balance and coordination, such as plank to low squat and alternating snatches, supports an advanced score due to the necessity for good body control and proprioception.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is structured with 12 supersets and intense exercises that require significant exertion. Each exercise involves 45 seconds of work with only 30 seconds of rest, enhancing cardiovascular and muscle endurance demands. The instructions to use moderately heavy weights further indicate a challenging effort level, especially for deconditioned users. The description of the workout's ability to 'pump the heart rate' and 'build lean muscle while burning fat' suggests a high-intensity format less suitable for novices.",

    }
  ],
  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.75,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The intermediate level is appropriate given the mention of moderately heavy weights and the complexity of some exercises, implying a baseline fitness is necessary. The structure and exercise selection demand more from participants, aligning with users who have some consistent training experience. The no-repeat, supersets structure, and the advanced techniques require good form and endurance, thus meriting the advanced score too. The duration of 29 minutes with high-intensity elements also reduces suitability for very beginners, contributing to a higher required fitness level classification."
