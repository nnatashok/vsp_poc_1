    "Ran this everyday for two weeks before a 5k on Sunday and my time improved by over 4 minutes.    Love this tread workout and the positivity!",
    "I\u2019m 57 and have dropped 25lbs thx to Ibex running and training by mind eliminate sugar and seriously cut carbs. This morning my wife told me that I\u2019m looking great - is there better motivation than that?",
    "OK, this was amazing!! The intervals, speed, and intensity were perfect! Absolutely loved this run! Please do more of these! Thank you for another wonderful workout!",
    "Just did this for the first time. Fantastic!",
    "#3 in the 7 day IBX challenge (see IBX&#39;s playlist) - done. I saw this one on the channel, but didn&#39;t run with it because I had my two lunchtime favorites &quot;endurance run for weight loss&quot; and &quot;25 min treadmill HIIT (declining HIIT)&quot;. Switched it up today and did this Orange run followed by Rachael&#39;s declining HIIT. Good sweaty combo. I love Rachael&#39;s question... what are you trying to accomplish? It made me think... what would I be doing if I wasn&#39;t on this tread addiction? Hmmmm - wasting time surfing the net... staring in the refrigerator... NO buddy, not going back there. In the last year I&#39;ve dusted off the treadmill and am down 35 pounds to a svelte 118 lbs. and stronger than ever! Yes I have to be my own cheerleader, but THANK YOU THANK YOU for IBX Running and Carolyn Girvan&#39;s YouTube channel with her strength training EPIC programs. As Veronica says... &quot;LET&#39;S GO RUNNERS!!!&quot;"
