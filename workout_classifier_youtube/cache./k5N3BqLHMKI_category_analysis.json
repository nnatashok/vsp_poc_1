  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Treadmill' with a high confidence level of 1.0 due to the explicit mention of 'treadmill' in the title, description, and tags, such as '20-Min Interval Treadmill Run' and 'Bowflex BXT216 Treadmill.' The workout's focus on treadmill-based exercise is central, as indicated by frequent references to treadmill use in both the video and the giveaway associated with a treadmill. \n\nThe second category is 'HIIT' with a confidence score of 0.8. This is supported by phrases like '20-minute high intensity interval training workout,' 'inspired by Orange Theory,' and tags including 'HIIT' and 'high intensity,' which suggest the workout involves alternating periods of intense activity and rest typically associated with HIIT methodologies. User comments further indicate the workout's intensity, often a hallmark of HIIT.\n\nThere is little ambiguity, as both treadmill usage and HIIT are explicitly mentioned, with no strong evidence of other workout types being involved."
