    "I\u2019ve been going to the gym for a long time but I\u2019ve never done anything like this. The pistol squats are a killer.",
    "Thanks for posting this. As a beginner, I was feeling a bit lost in the world of calisthenics, and I needed a good solid routine like this one to follow daily. You delivered, thank you.",
    "I loved this workout! I&#39;ve found a lot of other calisthenics workouts are just exhausting and impossible for me to get through, but this one is the right level of intensity that I can complete it but still feel challenged!",
    "Stumbled over this in search of home-friendly body weight follow-along workouts. I really liked this, although it was horrible. Absolutely exhausting. I have a desk job and my goal is to feel stronger, more connected in my body and have more flexibility. This kind of workout is perfect, since I can do one before lunch and one in the evening. Saved to my workout playlist, thank you!",
    "I did not think it will be so challenging, I&#39;m adding it to may routine. Instructions that you gave were also great! Thank you for your hard work!"
