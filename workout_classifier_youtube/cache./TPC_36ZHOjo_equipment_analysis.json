  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '20 Minute Guided Meditation For The Heart \u2764 | Self Love, Inner Wisdom & Compassion' does not specify any physical exercises or movements that would typically require workout equipment. It is a guided meditation practice aimed at cultivating self-love, inner wisdom, and compassion, using mindfulness and breath work as its core elements. No mention of mats, weights, or any other props typically associated with exercise is made in the title, description, or tags. The entire focus is on achieving a state of relaxation and inner peace, suggesting this is a non-physical, audio-guided session rather than a workout requiring equipment. Therefore, the workout is bodyweight only (in this context, meaning no equipment is needed)."
