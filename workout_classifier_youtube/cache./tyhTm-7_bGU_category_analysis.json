  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Indoor biking' with a score of 0.85 due to multiple indicators suggesting the workout revolves around the Airdyne bike, as highlighted in the title 'Airdyne Bike - Full Body Workout'. Tags such as 'airdyne', 'air dyne bike', and comments that focus on the versatility and full-body workout potential of the Airdyne support this categorization strongly. The presence of terms like 'exercise', 'bike', and 'cardio' in the tags also supports this classification. Body weight exercises could play a minor role, suggested by the mention of full-body workout and specific body parts like 'legs', 'quads', 'biceps', 'tricep' in the tags. However, the focus on the Airdyne bike suggests these exercises could be integrated while utilizing the bike, thus giving 'Body weight' a lower score of 0.3. The strong relevance and emphasis on the Airdyne bike as central to the workout justifies the high confidence of 0.85 for 'Indoor biking'."
