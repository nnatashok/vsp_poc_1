  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Masterclass Workout' with a score of 0.7. Evidence for this choice comes from the title indicating a 'Pilates Core Workout' and the channel host being a 'Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor.' The structured and technique-focused nature of Pilates, alongside the no-equipment approach, supports this classification.\n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Foundation Builder' with a score of 0.6. The workout title and tags emphasize 'core workout' and 'total core,' indicating a focus on foundational strength, aligning with improving core stability and strength.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Meditative Grind' is suggested with a score of 0.5. The format described ('30 Minute Pilates Core Workout') implies repetitive, focused movements, typical of Pilates, which can induce a meditative state through concentration and controlled breathing.\n\nComments highlight a positive, supportive environment, but do not indicate high-energy or competitive elements, thus excluding vibes related to intensive cardiovascular or competition-centric workouts."
