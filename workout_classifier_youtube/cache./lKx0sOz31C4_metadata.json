    "Hello! This is my second time being pregnant, and I&#39;m only a little over 6 weeks along. My first pregnancy didn&#39;t go beyond 7 weeks, and I was devastated. I&#39;m not gonna lie: I&#39;m still recovering mentally and emotionally from it since it happened in the middle of last year. I&#39;m hoping I make it beyond the 7 weeks this time, but it&#39;s not easy: I&#39;m already considered a high risk pregnancy with only one kidney, and I&#39;m taking the necessary time off from work to help reduce my stress. However, it is making me very restless. I got back into yoga just shortly before I found out I was pregnant, and your videos have helped me tremendously! Thank you so much! I&#39;m trying to stay positive for myself, my baby, and my husband! I&#39;d welcome any and all healing vibes- and I&#39;ll be sure to give quite a few back to you all! Be well! \u2764",
    "alhamdulillah I am very grateful to find this video, currently I am pregnant with my 7th child at the age of 40. I pray that Allah will ease the pregnancy process until delivery for me and all of us who are currently pregnant.",
    "Almost 33 weeks pregnant and trying to do 2-3 videos of yours a week plus daily walks. Preparing for the big day!",
    "Im not very active. I\u2019m 29 weeks 5 days today. I stopped at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKx0sOz31C4&amp;t=803\">13:23</a> this is hard when you aren\u2019t a very active person. I have hardwood floors and I need to figure out something to help ease the pain off my knees and hands when on the ground. I don\u2019t have a mat and the rug I have doesn\u2019t feel different than the floor. Tomorrow I\u2019m going to try again but I am out of breathe and my hands and knees hurt. \ud83d\ude05 I know this won\u2019t compare to labor pain but I\u2019m still proud of myself."
