  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for the video strongly suggests that a yoga mat is used and recommended, particularly evident in the description where there is a prompt to \"Shop the yoga mat that I use\". This implies that a mat is central to the workout experience. Furthermore, considering the nature of the video which is focused on yoga for lower back pain, a mat would typically be the primary equipment to provide comfort and support during floor exercises depicted as part of yoga practices. Given the focus on gentle, beginner-friendly yoga stretches, and the common use of a mat for such routines, a confidence score of 0.9 is assigned to the Mat."
