  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is **Yoga** with a score of 0.9 due to the explicit mention of 'daily yoga flow' in both the title and description. The video is identified as a yoga session focusing on a full-body routine that incorporates varied yoga elements like vinyasa flow, hip openers, backbends, and standing balances, which are quintessential yoga postures.\n\nFurthermore, the host of the channel, Charlie Follows, is a registered yoga teacher with a substantial background in yoga and anatomy, which fortifies this classification. The channel's primary focus is on yoga content, emphasizing the practice's benefits, reinforcing the high confidence level in categorizing this video as Yoga.\n\nA secondary category of **Stretching** with a score of 0.6 was selected because the description and comments mention the routine improves mobility and involves hip openers and backbends, which are essentially stretching components. However, these are integrated as part of the holistic yoga practice rather than standalone stretching exercises.\n\nThere is a strong focus on holistic practice, including meditation elements, as reflected in the comments, but this is considered a component of the yoga category rather than a distinct category."
