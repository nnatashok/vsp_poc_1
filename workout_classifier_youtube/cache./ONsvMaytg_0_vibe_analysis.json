  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of this workout video is 'The Deep Recharge,' scoring 0.9. The metadata strongly emphasizes deep, guided breathwork aimed at relaxation and self-discovery, a classic indicator of this vibe. The description mentions 'a more profound and immersive state of self-discovery,' 'emotional release,' and 'clarity,' which aligns perfectly with a nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement typical of 'The Deep Recharge.' The use of rhythmic music to deepen the relaxation state further supports this classification.\n\n'The Zen Flow' scores 0.8, as the session places significant emphasis on 'breath-centered,' 'conscious connected breathing,' and meditation practices. This indicates an intentional, grounding, and unhurried flow associated with this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Mindful Walk' scores a moderate 0.6 because the practice involves guided breathing intended to trigger reflective and meditative states, akin to a story-driven, immersive experience. However, 'The Deep Recharge' and 'The Zen Flow' scores are higher due to the explicit emphasis on relaxation, breathwork, and meditation in the metadata.\n\nOverall, the high number of views and comments about profound personal reflections indicate the session's strong impact."
