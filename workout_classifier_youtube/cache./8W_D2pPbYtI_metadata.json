    "Been doing Pilates all days for 1 month on this channel. I&#39;m healing my ED and trying to adopt a healthy lifestyle, after feeling my body so week for so many years I&#39;m finally feeling happy and peaceful w/ these exercises. At first I wasn&#39;t sure if I was going to keep the routine because it was very difficult and I couldn&#39;t finish almost anything, but now it is very relaxing and my strength keeps improving so much.",
    "I am a competitive soccer player and when I tell you my abs are looking so amazing, I am not kidding! I love your workouts so much. Along with good eating habits, weights, training, and recovery. I can literally feel and see myself getting stronger every day. I am using your workouts to prepare my self for in person Pilates!!<br><br>To all the girls that are afraid of diversifying your workout schedule, don\u2019t be afraid! You won\u2019t get bulky doing weights! Once you incorporate Lidia\u2019s workouts with different forms of exercise, you will definitely achieve your goals!",
    "i don\u2019t often attempt lidia\u2019s longer workouts but when i do, the time goes by so quickly that you don\u2019t even realise you have finished. thank you lidia for this amazing workout. i was sweating afterwards but loved it nonetheless!",
    "I haven\u2019t worked out for a good while, almost an year due to some health problems and also school\ud83d\ude43 but I want to share that after feeling powerless and unmotivated, I succeeded in doing one workout per day for seven days straight. I am so proud of myself for not giving up. I thank God for this opportunity and also thank you Lidia for introducing me again to the joyfulness of moving my body. Honestly time passed so fast, I didn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s exhausting or stressful. I really enjoy the breaks because it gives me a moment to breath. Before taking some time off from working out I used to watch videos where the fitness instructor was really idk excited, loud or stirred and I guess that didn\u2019t work out for me because I was just feeling a kind of pressure, but in this light way of moving my body, I feel like I can do more because it is so peaceful.",
    "I\u2019ve been doing your workouts daily for about 3 weeks now and I can definitely say there\u2019s been incredible results!! I feel so much stronger and more energetic, my endurance has definitely improved, my stomach and thighs have shrank noticeably. Thank you so much I adore your videos keep doing what you\u2019re doing \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa"
