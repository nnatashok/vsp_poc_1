  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly designed as a virtual running video intended for use with a treadmill. This is evident from multiple occurrences of \"treadmill\" in the title, tags, and description. The video is meant to accompany treadmill workouts by providing scenic views to enhance the running experience, as highlighted in the tag \"scenic running videos for treadmill.\" The description emphasizes that this is a virtual run, and the channel is dedicated to virtual running, which usually involves using a treadmill for such exercises. Therefore, I assign a confidence level of 0.9 for the treadmill being required equipment for this workout."
