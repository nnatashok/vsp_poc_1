  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is strongly indicated by the nature of the workout. The video is a focused 20-minute strength training session specifically tailored for pregnant women, emphasizing safe and progressive exercise with dumbbells. The description highlights the importance of using an appropriate weight and being mindful of one's body, which indicates a methodical and disciplined approach (e.g., 'use a weight that feels good for you'). The use of \"pregnancy strength workout\" and safety disclaimers further suggests structured guidance, thus a score of 0.75 is appropriate.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant due to the prenatal context, emphasizing gentle care and well-being during pregnancy. The comments reflect a focus on safely moving and feeling good while pregnant, and keywords like 'safe' and 'healing' (from the channel information) support this spirit, earning a score of 0.7. The inclusion of stretching and guidance to prevent discomfort also supports this spirit.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are less applicable due to the prenatal focus and emphasis on safety and moderation in this workout."
