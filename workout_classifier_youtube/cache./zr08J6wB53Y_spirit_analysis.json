  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as \"High-Energy & Intense\" with a very high confidence level of 0.95. This is supported by phrases like \"HIGH INTENSITY WORKOUT,\" \"burn lots of calories,\" \"still burning lots of calories,\" and \"killer routine\" in the title and description, which strongly indicate a fast-paced, challenging workout designed to maximize effort and calorie burn in a short time. The comments also highlight the intense nature, noting sweat and the challenging aspect of completing the full 10 minutes.\n\nAdditionally, there is a noticeable element of \"Flow & Rhythm\" with a score of 0.6. The description mentions the \"amazing\" music, with a playlist of specific tracks, suggesting that the workout is likely synchronized with music, contributing to a flow-like experience. However, the primary focus remains intensity rather than smoothness or coordination, making this a secondary spirit.\n\nThe \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit was considered given the mix of quick movements and active breaks, but the focus on intensity and energetic music outweighs structure. Other spirits like \"Soothing & Restorative\" or \"Outdoor & Adventure\" were excluded due to lack of relevant indicators."
