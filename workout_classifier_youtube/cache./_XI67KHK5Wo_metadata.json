    "May my whole family see this video someday! No, the whole world! Kids need this in their lives! Think of the difference this would make in school alone everyone! This would be fantastic for kids! Push the envelope guys! Everything starts with education! My goal is to get so used to this method that I can do it without the videos instinctively! We can&#39;t rely on videos y&#39;all, but we can rely on ourselves, believe it! From my heart to all of yours out there! Bless up aye! This video needs some more views YouTube!",
    "Thank you for adding this.  4 rounds in a different way to wim hof is a great alternative",
    "Love this guy! He\u2019s so authentic\u2026 he\u2019s so real\u2026 I think it\u2019s time our buddy Kitaro does a full guided breathing meditation in addition to Wim Hof sessions",
    "This video is saving my life every day. Thanks Kitaro! Thank you Wim! And thanks to all the loving people choosing a better life!",
    "Thank you for another beautiful morning."
