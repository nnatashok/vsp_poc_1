  "spiritsExplanation": "The title and description of the video strongly indicate a workout designed for the third trimester of pregnancy, suggesting a gentle and supportive approach, hence the assignment of 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.7. The phrase 'pregnancy-safe cardio' implies modifications for safety and comfort, which aligns with the restorative spirit.\n\nThe description mentions following specific exercises and equipment, which indicates a 'Structured & Disciplined' approach, with logical sequencing and attention to detail. Thus, it receives a score of 0.6, reflecting a moderate emphasis on structured execution.\n\nThe comment questioning the intensity ('this looks too intense...') and the mention of 'big calorie burn' suggest an element of vigorous activity, justifying a 'High-Energy & Intense' classification with a score of 0.5. However, given it's prenatal, the intensity is likely moderated, affecting the confidence and score.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to lack of environmental elements or smooth, rhythmic flow indicators. The channel's focus on prenatal workouts further supports a structured and restorative analysis."
