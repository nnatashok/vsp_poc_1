  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata clearly indicates that this is an indoor cycling workout, as seen in the title '15 Minute Indoor Cycling Workout' and reiterated throughout the description, tags, and comments. The tags include phrases such as 'indoor cycling', 'spin class', 'spinning', and 'gym bike', all of which strongly suggest the use of an exercise bike. The channel itself, GCN Training, focuses on cycling workouts, further confirming that an exercise bike is needed for this session. There is very high confidence (1.0) that an exercise bike is required given the centrality of cycling to the workout content."
