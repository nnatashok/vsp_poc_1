  "vibesExplanation": "The workout primarily aligns with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe because it is a zone 2 cardio session, which is focused on sustaining a low to moderate heart rate over time, forming a rhythm through repetition and endurance. The description emphasizes a continuous, structured pace, and user comments highlight how the workout is easy to follow and contributes to mental calmness, suggesting a meditative quality. Given the structure includes repetition of exercises in a low-impact manner, it supports this categorization. \n\nAdditionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is a secondary vibe present due to the comments reflecting a feel-good, positive energy boost experienced by the users. While not as dominant as the meditative aspect, the focus on incremental heart rate increase and user-reported positivity hints at elements of an endorphin build-up through consistent movement. This categorization is made with moderate confidence due to the emphasis on repetition and mental calmness rather than explosive energy."
