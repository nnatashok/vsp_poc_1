  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is clearly centered around a 'Full Body Dumbbell Workout,' as indicated by the repetitive use of terms like 'dumbbell workout,' 'resistance training,' and 'strength workout' in both the title and description. This suggests the primary category of 'Weight workout' with a high score of 0.9. The video duration, tags, and focus on muscle building and strength imply a substantial emphasis on weight as a resistance tool.\n\nThe description also mentions the use of 'compound movements,' which aligns with the general principles of HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training), and the channel description highlights the use of HIIT in their workout routines. Therefore, the 'HIIT' category is applicable, though less explicitly, with a moderate score of 0.6. While the main workout format might not exhibit traditional HIIT's alternating rest exercises, the intensity and the implied variety support this category.\n\nOther potential categories like 'Body weight' and 'Indoor biking' were excluded since the emphasis is on weight training and dumbbells, not equipment-free or cycling workouts."
