  "spiritsExplanation": "The chosen spirits for this workout are 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Flow & Rhythm'. 'Soothing & Restorative' is attributed with a high score (0.95) because the workout focuses on gentle, calming practices designed to relieve stress and anxiety, as indicated by tags such as 'stress relief', 'relieve anxiety', and 'calm breathing'. The description emphasizes relaxation and the comments highlight its impact on calmness and emotional relief, further supporting this classification. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit also applies, with a moderate score (0.6), as the guided breathing exercises promote rhythmic breathing and a smooth meditative experience, clearly evident from comments about the continuous, quick passage of time during the exercise. The absence of high-intensity language or structured training descriptors supports the exclusion of more energetic spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined'. Overall, the focus on guided meditation and emotional restoration aligns strongly with the chosen spirits."
