    "I love this workout so much. I usually just use this as a warmup before I do one of your harder ones but today I used this as a stand-alone workout because I\u2019m getting over a bad cold and I wanted to do a small workout without pushing myself too hard. <br><br>It really helps to hear that workouts don\u2019t always mean having to be sweating and out of breath so thank you for that \ud83d\udc96",
    "Thanks for this video. As soon as I get my elliptical, I&#39;m starting with this one!",
    "I habent trained for 3 months, have a desk job, frlt tun down, developed sleep issues and this was lovely to ease back into exercise. Thank you!!\u2764",
