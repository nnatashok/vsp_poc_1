  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of all standing movements without any jumping, squats, or lunges, which suggests a focus on simpler movements suitable for beginners. However, it also challenges balance and coordination (as noted in a top comment), elevating some components to an intermediate level. The emphasis on engaging core muscles and maintaining balance suggests that while the movements are not overly complex, they require some degree of body awareness, placing them between beginner and intermediate levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Although the description mentions burning 250-300 calories and uses terms like 'intense' and 'sweaty,' the workout is described as a 30-minute session with intervals of 40 seconds on and 10 seconds off. This moderate duration and low-impact nature suggest a higher demand than light exercise, likely placing it in the moderate-to-challenging range due to the continuous nature and placement of the workout just shy of advanced energy expenditure, despite being categorized as low-impact in descriptors and comments.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique and effort difficulties suggest a broad accessibility. With cues for no jumping and no squats, those unfamiliar or deconditioned can potentially perform most movements safely. Intermediate and advanced ratings are due to balance challenges and sustained effort over 30+ minutes, as reflected in viewer feedback, with comments from users returning to exercise or experiencing muscle soreness indicating a more challenging experience than typical beginner workouts."
