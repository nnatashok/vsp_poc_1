    "Hey man . I have sever ptsd and am prone to crazy panic attacks that put me in the hospital . Currently feeling one come but lately I throw this on and just focus on the now and you\u2019ve honestly really helped my quality of life through a video which is crazy . Thanks man",
    "I have an essay thats due in two days which ive procastinated and left to the last minute because of my adhd :( My anxiety levels have been quite high these past few days and ive had this constant knot feeling in my stomach as well as this sensation of my throat closing up and finding it hard to breathe as a result. I decided to look up an emotional release meditation video as i was on the verge of tears and had been bottling up a lot of heavy emotions and knew it was time for a good emotional release session and letting go ritual. i stumbled across your guided breathwork for emotional release just now and decided to give it a go. Ive heard about the power of breathwork and have always found it fascinating but i just never really delved into it. I tried the emotional release video and this one and I am literally lost for words. I feel amazing. I feel recharged, rejunivated and full of positive energy. I feel lighter and i feel like i can actually breathe. The knot in my stomach has gone and I actually feel almost high which i didnt even think was possible!!!! like my head and my brain just feels so much ligher and i have so much more mental clarity now.  I burst into tears towards the end of the emotional release video and realised i had been holding onto a lot of stress and tension. Thankyou\ud83e\udd0dI feel very connected to this channel and feel like the universe guided me here. Divine timing never fails to amaze me:) The plan was to do some work on the essay after a meditation video but its made me feel kinda sleepy, it is quite late anyway so i think im going to call it a night and get some mental rest and crack on it tomorrow. Thankyou again\ud83d\udc9e Keep doing what you are doing, much love - kim\ud83e\udd0d",
