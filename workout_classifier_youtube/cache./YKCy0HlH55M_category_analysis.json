  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Indoor biking,' as strongly indicated by multiple elements in the metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'Cycling Workout for Beginners,' and the description further emphasizes that it is an indoor cycling session intended for those with a 'spinning bike, exercise bike, or stationary bike.' Tags such as 'cycling workout,' 'beginner spin workout,' 'indoor cycling workouts,' and 'spin class' corroborate this categorization. Additionally, the channel 'Kaleigh Cohen Cycling' focuses on cycle and strength training, showing a specialization in indoor biking. The video includes detailed instructions on cycling positions and activities like 'Climbs' and 'Sprints,' which are typical of a spin class format, reinforcing the classification with high confidence. No other categories apply, as the content does not reference any other workout types."
