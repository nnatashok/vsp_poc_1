  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists exclusively of bodyweight exercises, which typically have lower technique complexity than weighted exercises. The session includes 20 different exercises, but given the emphasis on bodyweight and no equipment, these movements are likely to be straightforward. Furthermore, the nature of the workout being follow-along and suitable for various time structures suggests it's designed to be accessible. While some might require a basic level of coordination or balance, overall these exercises are not technically demanding. Therefore, the technique difficulty is primarily Beginner with some elements of Intermediate due to potential coordination needs.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is moderately demanding due to its 21-minute duration and the structure of 45 seconds of work with 15 seconds of rest. The continuous flow of exercises with minimal rest will maintain heart rate and energy expenditure at a level that is challenging for deconditioned individuals. However, the option for adjustment in rest and work period can make it more or less taxing, allowing flexibility. Hence, it's primarily Moderate, with some potential for being Challenging based on intensity during active intervals and overall pace.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the Beginner and Intermediate technique difficulty coupled with Moderate to Challenging effort difficulty, this workout is most appropriate for those at the Beginner and Intermediate levels. However, the workout's duration and continuous nature, alongside modification options, suggest that more physically active individuals can also benefit from it. Increased effort from more minimal rest can raise its challenge to an Advanced level. Most users can adjust the workout intensity by altering work/rest ratios; therefore, it comfortably suits multiple fitness levels, particularly for those with varied modification options available."
