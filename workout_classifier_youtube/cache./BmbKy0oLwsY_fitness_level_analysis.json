  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is described as a 'Beginner Full Body Stretching Routine,' indicating very basic movements suitable for those new to exercise. Stretching generally involves straightforward techniques with minimal coordination or balance requirements, placing it firmly in the 'Beginner' category. User comments such as one from a 70-year-old experiencing significant benefit underscore its accessibility. The need for a chair for support in some stretches suggests minor balance challenges, which could slightly edge into 'Intermediate' for certain individuals.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This workout involves a stretching routine, which typically exerts low physical demand (Light effort). The video's description as suitable for those feeling 'sore and stiff' suggests minimal exertion, emphasizing relaxation over calorie burn or muscle fatigue. It is a 26-minute session, slightly over the threshold for a beginner workout, prompting a modest consideration for 'Moderate' effort, as maintaining some stretches can require endurance particularly if individuals are holding them for longer periods. However, the overall consensus from metadata and viewer comments supports a classification of Light difficulty.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The 'Beginner' classification is dominant given the title and target audience, as well as the nature of stretching exercises. Given the length of the video at 26 minutes, and slight technical aspects like maintaining balance in some stretches, it's also sensible to afford a secondary 'Intermediate' classification for those who might find the routine slightly more challenging. User feedback highlights accessibility to even elderly audiences, reinforcing the Beginner classification as suitable and safe, but slightly pushing the limits into Intermediate for total duration."
