  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title '20 Minute High Intensity Indoor Cycling Workout' explicitly indicates the use of a stationary bike, commonly referred to as an 'exercise bike.' The description supports this by highlighting a 'highly effective cycling training session designed for home workouts.' Additionally, tags like 'Cycling Training,' 'Turbo session,' and 'Bike' further bolster this identification. The channel 'Global Cycling Network' is dedicated to cycling content. There is no mention of other equipment, leading to a very high confidence score of 1.0 for the requirement of an exercise bike."
