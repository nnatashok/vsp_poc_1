  "spiritsExplanation": "The video 'Relaxing FULL BODY STRETCH // Flexibility & Mobility' is predominantly characterized by the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The title and description emphasize relaxation, unwinding, easing soreness, and improving flexibility and mobility, which are all key elements of restorative workouts. The use of phrases like 'Ahhh it's time to relax' and 'unwind' in the description reinforce this classification. Tags such as 'recovery workout,' 'recovery stretch,' 'stretch for relaxation,' and 'guided stretch' highlight this restorative nature, supporting a high confidence level of 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nThe secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm,' is included due to hints of smoothness and continuity, implied by terms like 'stretching routine' and the focus on working 'at your own pace.' Although it's not the main focus, this adds a feeling of rhythmic flow to the session. However, since the primary aim is relaxation and restoration, the score for this spirit is moderate at 0.5.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are not applicable due to the relaxed and soothing nature of the workout."
