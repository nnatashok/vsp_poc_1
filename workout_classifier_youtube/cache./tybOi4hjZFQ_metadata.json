  "title": "Guided Wim Hof Method Breathing",
  "description": "!! Don't do the breathing exercises in a swimming pool, before going underwater, beneath the shower, or piloting any vehicle. Always practice sitting or lying down in a safe environment. Tinnitus symptoms may appear as a result of pushing too forcefully during the breathing exercise. If this happens, take a step back in your future practice, it\u2019s important to increase gradually, not forcefully !!\n\nSafety: Read about Shallow Water Blackout:\nhttps://www.wimhofmethod.com/what-is-shallow-water-blackout\n\nThis Breathing Bubble is an audiovisual guide that helps you maintain rhythm and pace during your breathing sessions.

  "channelDescription": "\"There is nothing superhuman about me. I am just a man who loves fulfilling human potential.\"\n\nWim Hof (\"The Iceman\") is the creator of the Wim Hof Method. Through more than thirty years of training in nature, he has developed a method that combines specific breathing techniques, cold exposure and mindset. This method has been the first to scientifically prove the ability to actively influence the innate immune system and the autonomic nervous system.\n\nWim holds 26 world records, and has numerous other feats under his belt. He ran a marathon under the Polar Circle in nothing but shorts, holds the world record for sitting in ice \u2014at almost two hours\u2014 and has climbed Mt. Everest to the Death Zone point, also in shorts.\n\n*FREE WIM HOF METHOD MINI CLASS*:\nhttps://wimhofmethod.com/free-mini-class\n\n",

    "Today is my 5th day without nicotine from any delivery system. No vape, cigarettes, chew, gum, or patches. Nothing. I 100% couldn&#39;t have made it this far without Wims method. Oh and I&#39;m quitting mid divorce while extremely financially strained. I&#39;ve literally never been this stressed and I&#39;m still doing OK. All the love, all the power!<br><br>Btw, thank you to everyone for supporting me in this. Getting the reaction this did really helped me keep going.",
    "I\u2019m getting married in 1 hour and it wouldn\u2019t be possible without people like y\u2019all and this video.  Thank you, truly.",
    "140 days sober and doing this 2-3 times a day, sometimes 7 just depends. I pray on the holds."
