  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is predominantly classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' due to several factors. The emphasis on a 'Full Body Stretch', along with the use of the word 'yoga', points towards a session that is more gentle and focused on recovery and relaxation rather than high intensity. The multiple mentions of 'morning' and 'daily routine' in user comments suggest a calming start to the day, reinforcing the restorative aspect. The channel's philosophy of promoting 'a healthy and joyful life' in harmony with nature further supports this classification. Thus, a high score of 0.8 is given for this spirit.\n\nThe classification of 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.6 is supported by comments describing the session as containing 'aasans wrapped up in 15 minutes' and the fluid nature of it being a 'combination of movements'. Such descriptors indicate a continuous and smooth transition between poses, typical of a flow-centric practice. The description and comments do not suggest intensity or rigorous discipline, discounting 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined'. Overall, the cues from metadata strongly suggest a calming and rhythmic session, with high confidence in this classification."
