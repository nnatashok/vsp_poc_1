  "vibesExplanation": "The video title and description clearly signal a \"The Warrior Workout\" vibe, as the phrases \"Full Body HIIT Workout,\" \"No Repeats, No Rest,\" and \"push your limits\" describe a sweat-dripping, heart-pounding session typically associated with vigorous HIIT routines. The use of bodyweight-only exercises and a no-rest format further emphasize high intensity and effort, justifying a strong match with a score of 0.9.\n\n\"The Firestarter\" is applicable due to the workout's fast pace and intensity markers like \"burn fat\" and \"build strength,\" indicating explosive effort within a compact timeframe. The inclusion of movements such as \"Power Slams\" and \"Fast Feet\" reflect short, high-intensity bursts typical of this vibe, warranting a score of 0.7.\n\nThe unpredictable and varied exercise lineup, accompanied by rapid transitions, suggests elements of \"The Adrenaline Rush,\" where continuous, intense activity maintains high excitement and heart rate. This results in a moderate match with a score of 0.6.\n\nWhile the video description suggests energy and challenge, no explicit gamification or competitive aspects, typical of \"The Competitor,\" were noted. The absence of zen or meditative elements in content ruled out those vibes. Overall, the metadata strongly supports the identified vibes."
