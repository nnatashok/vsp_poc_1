  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified for this video is \"The Zen Flow,\" due to its focus on breath-centered, intentional practice that is slow and grounding in nature. The title and description emphasize the power of breath control and meditation-like attributes which align well with The Zen Flow vibe. Terms like \"breath control,\" \"reduce stress,\" and \"find balance\" suggest a grounding practice. The mention of improving focus and inducing calmness also supports this classification. A score of 0.8 reflects strong indicators in the metadata.\n\n\"The Deep Recharge\" is also relevant, as the video emphasizes elements like \"reduce stress\" and \"improve lung capacity,\" implying a refreshing, restorative focus suitable for nervous system reset. \"Breathing exercises for stress\" and \"breathing for sleep\" suggest a deep, restorative vibe. However, since the video also highlights some active benefits like increased energy, it's less of a perfect fit, hence the lower score of 0.6.\n\nOther vibes were less relevant as the video does not emphasize high intensity, competition, or gamified elements which characterize 'The Warrior Workout,' 'The Competitor,' or similar vibes. The classification confidence is high (0.9) due to clear metadata indicators for these vibes."
