  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of an all-standing cardio HIIT routine, which generally involves straightforward movements without the need for complex coordination. The absence of equipment suggests that movements like simple standing squats or lunges might be included, which do not require advanced technique. Comments from users indicate that even a 70-year-old finds it manageable, suggesting a low barrier for technique. However, as it is a HIIT workout, some intermediate level of coordination might be involved due to the intensity and faster pace.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 20-minute cardio HIIT session with 45-second active intervals and 15-second rest, indicating moderate-to-challenging effort levels. The intensity implied by 'fat burning' and 'sweating' suggests a significant calorie burn (200-300 kcal). User comments describe it as a struggle initially but achievable, which aligns with moderate to challenging levels for those not regularly active.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the technique and effort difficulty, the workout fits primarily into the Beginner fitness level due to simple, all-standing movements and no equipment required. User feedback suggests it is achievable even by those coming out of inactivity or older in age, which supports a Beginner classification. However, the moderate intensity and HIIT nature warrant inclusion of the Intermediate level for less deconditioned users who would find the interval structure and dynamic nature of exercises more challenging."
