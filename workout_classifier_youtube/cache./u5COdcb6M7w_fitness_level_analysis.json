  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for this workout is rated primarily as 'Beginner' due to the nature of spin bike exercises, which are typically straightforward and involve repetitive cycling motions without complex choreography. Beginner-level users often employ these workouts because they require minimal coordination beyond pedaling and adjusting resistance. The mention of 'beginners' in the comments and the non-specific description further support this level. However, an 'Intermediate' level is also considered due to the HIIT format, which might involve some coordination for managing intervals and resistance adjustments, as indicated by user comments appreciating the workout's structure.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as 'Moderate' to 'Challenging'. The video duration is just under 20 minutes, which might be on the higher side for beginner-level deconditioned users. The HIIT nature of the workout implies alternating high intensity and rest periods, increasing the cardiovascular demand and energy expenditure. Descriptors such as 'insane' and 'HIIT workout' imply a demanding intensity, suggesting it would be quite challenging, especially for those not accustomed to high-intensity workouts. This fits both the moderate and challenging levels due to potential customization via self-regulated resistance.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is assessed as 'Beginner' and 'Intermediate'. Although the workout is labeled as 'insane', spin bike workouts generally cater to a wide range of fitness levels, as resistance can be adjusted to accommodate different capabilities. Many comments reflect satisfaction from users overcoming initial challenges, suggesting accessibility to beginners. However, the high intensity implied by 'HIIT' and 'insane' supports an inclusion of 'Intermediate', as it may demand more from individuals with minimal fitness backgrounds. The relatively short span enhances manageability, making it approachable, but the HIIT structure requires some physical capacity, placing intermediate in scope."
