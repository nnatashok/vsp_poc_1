  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned to this workout is 'Breathing exercises,' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is due to the explicit focus on 'Box Breathing,' a structured breathing technique as highlighted in the title and description. Terms like 'Box Breathing,' 'stress-reducing technique,' and 'calm breathing exercise' from the tags and description emphasize the central role of breathing exercises in this video. Additionally, the title's emphasis on 'Anxiety Reduction Pranayama Technique' strongly supports this classification.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Meditation,' with a score of 0.6. Although the primary focus is on breathing exercises, the overall context aligns with meditation practices, supported by mentions of 'meditation for stress relief' and the channel's focus on meditation content. User comments corroborate this by mentioning calmness and relaxation, typical outcomes of meditation practices.\n\nOther categories like 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were excluded due to a lack of explicit evidence pointing towards physical postures or flexibility training."
