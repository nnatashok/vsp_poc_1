  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "Couldn&#39;t figure out why I was absolutely DYING for the first 10 minutes...until I realized the playback speed was at 1.25x \ud83d\ude43 Thank you for setting the pace just right! I find following your flow and breathing is perfect. I&#39;m 5 days in to a month straight of Move with Nicole and am loving it!",
    "don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever met a workout of yours I didn&#39;t love! Thank you!",
    "I&#39;ve been doing your classes for a few months now, and my body is responding so well to them. Just the short 30 min workouts, a few days a week, and I feel like I&#39;m finally getting the results I was chasing for so long",
    "I must say that I really don&#39;t like repetitive exercises but I am NEVER bored or unmotivated with you. That is something! &lt;3"
