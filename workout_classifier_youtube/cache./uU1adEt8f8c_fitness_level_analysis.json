  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Due to the simplicity of the technique and light effort required, the workout is suitable for a Beginner fitness level. However, the integration of the Wim Hof Method and mindfulness meditation could present a slight learning curve, hence including a lower score for Intermediate. Users with minimal previous experience in breathwork may perceive it as mildly challenging, justifying its inclusion."
