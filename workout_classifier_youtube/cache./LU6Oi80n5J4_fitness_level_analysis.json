  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The guided breathing exercises, as suggested by the title and description, primarily involve deep breathing patterns and breath holds. These are fundamental practices within breathwork and don't require complex movements or coordination, aligning closely with the Beginner level. The Intermediate score comes from the breath holds and possible effects like light-headedness or tingling, which might require a basic understanding of breathwork principles to manage safely.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 15 minutes focused on deep breathing, the workout involves low physical exertion but requires awareness and control over breath patterns. While primarily light in energy demand, the experience can produce moderate stress reduction and energy-boosting effects as noted in the description and feedback, slightly raising the effort level to Moderate for some users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the Technique Difficulty and Effort Difficulty, the required fitness level is primarily Beginner since breathing exercises are accessible and low-impact. Intermediate consideration comes from the need to manage potential effects of breath holds like tingling sensations and light-headedness, suggesting that users with some prior exposure to breathwork might benefit more. This aligns with user feedback highlighting stress reduction and enhanced concentration, reflecting benefits a slightly more experienced user might better optimize."
