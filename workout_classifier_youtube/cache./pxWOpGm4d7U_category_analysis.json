  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Meditation' with a high score of 0.9. The metadata explicitly indicates this through the repeated use of the word 'meditation' in the title, tags, and description. Terms like 'guided meditation for anxiety and stress,' 'mindfulness meditation,' and 'meditation for positive energy' reinforce this classification, along with the title 'Guided Meditation for Anxiety & Stress.' The video focuses on mental relaxation and mindfulness, which are key components of meditation.\n\nThe second category, 'Breathing exercises,' is given a moderate score of 0.5 because the description suggests activities such as 'full body relaxation,' which often involves breath work, and this is a common component of guided meditations.\n\nLastly, 'Stretching' is included with a lower score of 0.2 due to the mention of 'gentle neck stretches.' Although it's not the primary focus, it indicates a mild presence of stretching exercises.\n\nGiven the content and the expertise area of the Lavendaire channel focusing on self-development and holistic wellness, there are no strong indicators for categories like 'Yoga,' 'Mat,' 'Body weight,' or 'Weight workout,' which are likely to involve more physical activity than described here."
