  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for the video suggests that it is a guided routine for neck and shoulder stretches intended to reduce muscle tension and relieve pain, particularly suitable for a home environment. The tags and description emphasize that this is a stretching routine that can be done as a work break at a desk, indicating primarily bodyweight exercises. There is no mention of any specific exercise equipment being required in the title, description, tags, or comments. Moreover, the routine is described as starting in a sitting position and including lying down exercises, which suggests it can be performed on any flat surface or even on a chair. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, requiring no equipment, which is why the required equipment list is empty."
