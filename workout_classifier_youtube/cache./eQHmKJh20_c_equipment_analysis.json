  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video appears to be a stretching routine designed to improve flexibility, with exercises like Hip Flexor Stretch, Elephant Walk, Pancake Stretch, and Figure 4 Stretch. The title, description, and comments indicate a focus on body movements that do not require any specific equipment. There is no mention of equipment in the description, tags, or comments, and the stretches listed in the top comment are typically performed on the floor or a mat. However, since mats are not explicitly mentioned, the video implies that this routine can be performed without any equipment. Therefore, the workout is concluded to be bodyweight only, requiring no additional equipment."
