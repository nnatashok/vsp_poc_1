It's very intense but that's what you need if you want to lose weight REAL FAST and keep it off for good!\n\nIf you do not have e an elliptical then just follow along with this workout on your treadmill, bike, glider or etc OR... you can even do it while running in place, jump rope or jumping jacks.\n\nQUICK TIP: wear a weight vest or add 10% of your body weight to lose weight EVEN faster with this elliptical workout so for example... If you weigh 200 pounds then wear a 20 pound weight vest or use a book bag filled with weights because the more you weight = the more calories you will burn.\n\nHere's the full workout laid out for you...\n\nGo all out on the elliptical for 30 seconds\n*****REST 30 seconds\nGo all out on the elliptical for 30 seconds\n*****REST 20 seconds\nGo all out on the elliptical for 30 seconds\n*****REST 10 seconds\nGo all out on the elliptical for 30 seconds\n*****REST 10 seconds\nGo all out on the elliptical for 30 seconds\n*****REST 20 seconds\nGo all out on the elliptical for 30 seconds\n*****REST 30 seconds\nGo all out on the elliptical for 30 seconds\n*****REST UP TO 1 Minute and repeat 1-to-3 times\n\nEach set last 5 \u00bd minutes so do at least 2 sets for a 13 minute workout and as you get in shape do 3+ sets and as for losing 10 pounds ASAP...\n\nDo this 30 minute workout 2 times a day (morning & evening) 3-to-4 days a week along with doing the diet at nowloss.com/diet or simply go here: http://www.nowloss.com/nowloss-diet.htm\n\nAnd NO. you don't have to use any resistance level but in the workout you see me doing the resistance is set on the basic 3 (out of 10) but whatever resistance level you use I recommend that you don't set it too high and not to set it so low that you can't control how fast your legs move.\n\nI'm also going at least 200 SPM (strides per minute) the entire workout which is about 80% of my max speed of 250-to-275 SPM but in the elliptical workout above I think was always over at least 220 SPM for the entire workout.\n\nTo get the best elliptical workout you can you want to do the same thing and stay at or over 80% of your max SPM the entire workout. TO get your max SPM just go all out as fast as you can for 15 seconds on the elliptical and then take that number and multiply it by .8\n\nFor example if your max SPM is 150 then 120 would be 80% and you want to stay over that the whole workout.\n\nSee my other elliptical workout here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjHaLu6QkdI\n\n***************************************\nMore Elliptical Workouts:\n10 minute Elliptical Workout: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjHaLu6QkdI\n\n32 minute, 747 calorie burning Elliptical Workout: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1esP3Zng8LQ\n\nJay-z Elliptical workout: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiECI4n365I\n\nYou can download a printable version of this workout along with the mp3 for motivation here: http://www.nowloss.com/elip\n\n****************************************************\nI'm Adrian Bryant & I'm the guy who created NowLoss.com to help you look good naked.
