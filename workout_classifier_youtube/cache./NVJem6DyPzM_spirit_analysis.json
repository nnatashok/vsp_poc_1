  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is heavily aligned with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as indicated by the title 'TABATA FINISHER // 5 Minute Spin Class \u2022 Intense Tabata Cycling Workout' and description mentioning 'spicy TABATA spin,' a type of HIIT workout known for its high intensity and quick bursts of effort. The '8 x 20s ON/10s OFF' format in the description is characteristic of interval training, contributing to the intense nature. This spirit is given a score of 0.9 due to the explicit emphasis on intensity.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also present with a score of 0.7, as the workout follows a clear structure typical of Tabata with specific timing and progression, shown in the detailed breakdown of intervals ('8 x 20s ON/10s OFF') and the warm-up and cool-down phases. This methodical approach signifies a disciplined format but is secondary to the intense energetic focus.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded as the workout is time-regimented and challenging, not focused on smooth transitions or recovery. 'Sport & Agility' wasn't selected as the emphasis is not on agility skills."
