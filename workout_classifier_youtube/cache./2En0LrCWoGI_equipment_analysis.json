  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title clearly states 'No Equipment,' highlighting that this workout does not require any additional gear beyond what is typically found in a home setting. Additionally, the description explicitly mentions, 'No equipment needed, just you and your mat.' While a mat is not considered as equipment for classification purposes since it's often an assumed necessity for comfort in floor-based workouts like Pilates, it reiterates the lack of need for other equipment. Tags such as 'at-home workout' and comments from viewers express the ease and accessibility of the workout, affirming that no special tools are needed beyond a common exercise surface. Thus, it is determined that the workout is bodyweight-only and no specific equipment is necessary."
