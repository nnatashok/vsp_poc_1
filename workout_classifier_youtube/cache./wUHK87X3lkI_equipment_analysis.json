  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title and tags emphasize flexibility and stretching, which typically suggest a workout format that is primarily bodyweight and involves floor exercises. This is strongly supported by the description, which includes a specific mention of the particular mat used by the instructor during the workout. Since the mat is explicitly referenced with a link for purchase and a discount code, it indicates that a mat is an essential piece of equipment for the routine. Thus, I have assigned it a very high confidence score of 0.9. There are no indications of other equipment being required in the provided metadata."
