  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title, tags, and description explicitly state that this is a 'No Equipment' workout. The emphasis on 'no equipment' is reinforced in the title ('No Equipment, No Repeats'), the tags ('no equipment workout', 'full body hiit workout no equipment'), and the description specifically mentions 'No Equipment'. The comments and the general content from the channel support a focus on bodyweight routines, making it very clear that no equipment is required to perform this workout effectively. Thus, the confidence level for the workout being bodyweight only is very high (0.8-1.0), and no specific equipment items are needed."
