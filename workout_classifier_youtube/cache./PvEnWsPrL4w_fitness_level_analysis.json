  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'beginner', with all exercises performed standing and low impact, indicating minimal complexity. The emphasis is on a non-intimidating, accessible format. Most movements are likely simple, with basic coordination required. Comments from users who began with limited fitness further reinforce the classification as beginner-friendly, though some users with a bit more experience might still find this useful, supporting a mild association with the Intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is branded as 'beginner' and 'low impact', suggesting low energy expenditure suitable for very deconditioned individuals. The 29:34 duration means it's not extremely short, indicating there might be moderate energy demand, especially for those completely new to exercise. The ability to 'pause whenever' and the comments of non-stop completion suggest that while it may become moderate, it starts as a light effort but can scale.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique and effort levels underscore suitability for beginners. However, for those beginning their fitness journey, including an intermediate level is reasonable as users can self-pace and adjust intensity. Positive progressions noted in the comments validate that more experienced beginners or those advancing could utilize it. The workout's adaptability allows those who are somewhat fit to find value, supporting an intermediate classification, albeit weaker. Advanced categorization is minimal and more hypothetical."
