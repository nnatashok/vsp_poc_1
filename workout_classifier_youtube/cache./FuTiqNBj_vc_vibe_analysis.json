  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is characterized by a calming and accessible approach, as indicated by the inclusion of 'hourglass pilates', a beginner-friendly description, and a lack of equipment. The vibe 'The Zen Flow' was chosen with a score of 0.7 due to the breath-centered and intentional nature of Pilates, suitable for both morning and nighttime sessions as described. \n\n'Pilates' typically requires focus on form and technique, aligning with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe, which received a score of 0.6 as it emphasizes skill-building and technique. Comments about consistent practice and noticeable physical improvements also align with this vibe. \n\n'10MIN full body' and 'beginner friendly' suggest an option for a quick, restorative routine fitting 'The Reboot Workout' for a gentle, refreshing vibe, hence a score of 0.4. However, its shorter duration and focus on a specific Pilates element limit it from scoring higher. The overall confidence in these classifications is 0.75, given clear indications of a calm and instructional style, though not explicitly stated for higher certainty."
