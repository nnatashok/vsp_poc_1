  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'CRAZY INTENSE 5 Minute Full Body HIIT WORKOUT (Bodyweight Beat Down!)' explicitly specifies that it is a bodyweight workout. Both the title and multiple instances in the description emphasize that this workout requires no additional equipment and can be performed anywhere. The workout routine consists of exercises like jumping jacks, squats with knee tuck, burpees, and rocket lunges, which are all traditionally performed with just body weight. There is no mention of any equipment in the tags or in the specified exercises. Additionally, the channel Criticalbench often promotes bodyweight and minimal-equipment workouts, reinforcing the idea that no extra equipment is necessary for this routine. Therefore, this workout appears to be bodyweight only."
