    "Hi Adriene! This is my first comment on any YouTube video ever, but I wanted to share that today I\u2019m celebrating 1000 DAYS of yoga with you! \u263a\ufe0f<br><br>On March 26th, 2020, I decided to complete your 20-minute bedtime yoga sequence to calm myself down. While all of my commitments, employment, and mental stability fell apart, I convinced myself that if I could accomplish just one thing each day\u2014like getting on the yoga mat\u2014then I would be okay.<br><br>I\u2019m more than okay now. I\u2019m f*<b>**</b> great. I haven\u2019t missed a day with you since, and I don\u2019t intend on missing any in the future. Thank you for accompanying me every morning and guiding me on this beautiful journey.",
