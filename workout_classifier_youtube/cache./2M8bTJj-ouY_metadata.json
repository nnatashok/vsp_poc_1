  "description": "Tap in with us for a FULL BODY strength workout that will help build your muscular-endurance. We've split this workout up into 3 groups of 3 exercises that will be done back-to-back-to-back with only a rest period between each group. First, we recommend skimming through the workout to preview the exercises so that you can prep for what weights you want to use. Aim to use 1 set of dumbbells that you can manage for each of the 3 exercises. Over time you can increase the weight and challenge yourself with some progressive overload. Give this workout a shot and drop a comment letting us know how you did! \n\nLTK Link To Our Outfits:\n\nhttps://liketk.it/4Fzk7\n\nSubscribe To Our App [7 DAYS FREE]:\nhttps://www.juiceandtoya.app\n\nOur Podcast YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@JuiceandToyaPodcast\n\nCheck out our Merch! \nhttps://www.onebodyla.com/shop\n\nLTK Link to Outfits: \nhttps://liketk.it/4EVzT\n\nJuice OBLA Shorts: https://www.onebodyla.com/product-page/pace-breaker-linerless-short-7\n\nFollow Us on Instagram/Tik Tok For More Content:\nJuice: @juicetontx\nToya: @toyacherrelle \nOBLA: @onebodyla\nTikTok: @juiceandtoya",
