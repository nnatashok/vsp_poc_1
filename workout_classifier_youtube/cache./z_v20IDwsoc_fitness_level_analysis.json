  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is primarily classified as 'Beginner' with a score of 0.9, supported by the frequent mention of 'beginner' in the title, tags, and description. The movements are likely straightforward, focusing on basic stretches with minimal coordination required. There's a small score for 'Intermediate' (0.3), acknowledging the potential for slightly complex movements given references to squat depth and mobility flow, but overall, these are not indicative of high technique complexity.",

  ],
  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as 'Light', supported by the short workout duration of 11:34 and the focus on stretching, which typically involves low energy expenditure. The description emphasizes improvements in flexibility and mobility, which align with light effort. Comments reflect the routine as 'doable and effective' which supports the light effort classification. There are no indicators of high-intensity work or cardio components that would increase effort demands.",

    }
  ],
  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.88,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is predominantly 'Beginner' (0.95 score), as the workout is explicitly described as 'beginner-friendly' and the user comments suggest it is achievable for individuals with low flexibility. The Intermediate score of 0.4 reflects the fact that while primarily beginner-oriented, an individual with slightly more experience may also benefit, especially due to references of targeting squat depth and back relief which might be more effective for intermediate users. Overall, the workout suits beginners best."
