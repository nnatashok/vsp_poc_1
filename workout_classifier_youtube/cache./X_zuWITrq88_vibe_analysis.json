  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Full Body Stretch and Strength Routine | Increase Flexibility | 25 Mins' on Caroline Girvan's channel is best categorized under 'The Reboot Workout' vibe primarily because it focuses on stretching, relaxation, and gentle movements, as indicated by terms like 'relaxing stretch' and 'gentle holds' in the description. This fits the 'Reboot Workout' criteria of deep stretching and total-body refresh at a score of 0.75. \n\nThe inclusion of movements aiming to increase flexibility, along with gentle holds and dynamic moves, aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, characterized by breath-centered and intentional movements. The focus on relaxation and calm environment supports this classification, scoring 0.65.\n\n'Comfort Moves' partially fits due to comments indicating its suitability for older audiences and its safe, feel-good nature ('over 50', 'refreshing'). However, because it also incorporates some dynamic strength elements, it scores lower at 0.5.\n\nThe use of music with a beat and user comments about its energizing effect exclude 'Reboot Workout' or 'Zen Flow' exclusivity, but these still characterize the session primarily as rejuvenating and calming."
