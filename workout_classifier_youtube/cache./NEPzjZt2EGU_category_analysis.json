  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Meditation' with a high confidence score of 0.95. This is because the video is explicitly titled 'Guided Meditation,' and the metadata repeatedly emphasizes elements such as 'Transforming Emotions,' 'Guided Meditation,' and 'mindfulness meditation.' These indicate a strong focus on meditative practices designed to promote mental calmness, concentration, and emotional relief. Moreover, user comments reflect experiences consistent with deep meditative states, further reinforcing this categorization.\n\nA secondary category of 'Yoga' is included with a score of 0.5, reflecting moderate relevance. While not directly a yoga session, the channel often blends yoga philosophy and practice with its meditation, evidenced by tags like 'Yoga' and the description mentioning 'a positive state of mind' and 'improve your concentration.' However, since there is no direct evidence of physical yoga postures, its score remains moderate.\n\nOther categories are excluded due to the focus on meditation without physical exercise elements typical of those, such as 'Body weight' or 'Stretching.'"
