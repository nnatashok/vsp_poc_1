  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.9. This is strongly indicated by the words 'stretch,' 'recovery,' and 'flexibility' in the title, tags, and description, emphasizing a gentle and healing approach focused on relaxation and stress reduction. The video targets specific areas like the hamstrings, butt, and hips for muscle recovery, which aligns with a restorative focus. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present but to a lesser degree, with a score of 0.4. The 'follow along stretch for flexibility' tag and the implied continuous routine suggest elements of a flowing sequence, indicating a minor presence of fluid movement patterns. However, the primary emphasis on recovery and flexibility marks the session as more restorative than rhythmic.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are not applicable here due to the lack of intensity or strict procedural focus in the session. Additionally, no elements suggest a 'Sport & Agility' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit, as the workout is indoors and not sport-specific."
