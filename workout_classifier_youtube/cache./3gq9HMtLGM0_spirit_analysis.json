  "spiritsExplanation": "The title '20 Minute Everyday Yoga Flow | Daily Routine To Feel Your Best' and the description indicate a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit with phrases like 'full body routine,' 'vinyasa flow,' and 'steady flow,' emphasizing seamless, continuous movement characteristic of this spirit. The consistent mention of 'everyday,' 'all levels,' and 'feel your best' suggests a daily, adaptable practice that enhances mind-body connection, granting this a high confidence score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also present but to a lesser extent. The comments and description emphasize simplicity, peace, and nature ('practicing by the stream'), adding an element of relaxation and restoration. The class seems designed not just for physical exercise but also for mental well-being, supported by comments lauding the peaceful experience. Thus, it receives a moderate score of 0.7.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'High-Energy & Intense' are not prominent here, given the video's focus on accessibility, fluidity, and relaxation. The channel's background further substantiates these spirit choices with its emphasis on spreading joy through movement, aligning with these selected spirits."
