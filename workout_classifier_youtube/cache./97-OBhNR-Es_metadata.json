    "I Love you, Rachel. I live in Ft Lauderdale Florida. You are part of my daily routine. I do a lot of weight training classes and then need a good stretch or a relaxing workout with you. Some of my favorites are ballet barre and band classes. I would love if you did more band classes and more ballet barre. They are so effective!"
