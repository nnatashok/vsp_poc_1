  "spiritsExplanation": "The dominant spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' (score: 0.9) due to the title and description emphasizing relaxation through a \"breathing exercise\" and \"guided meditation\". The focus is on calming anxiety and promoting a peaceful, present state, which aligns closely with the restorative spirit. The high view count and comments like \"thankful for aiding me through these meditations\" and \"very engaging yet relaxing\" further support this categorization.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also applicable (score: 0.6), with the video encouraging continuous breathing patterns and a rhythmical presence through guided instruction, albeit not centered on movement but on the meditative breathing itself. User comments about maintaining attention indicate a subtle emphasis on keeping a mental flow.\n\nThe absence of high-energy, structured technical elements, or outdoor components excludes other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Outdoor & Adventure'. Therefore, the analysis leans confidently towards a meditation-focused approach for classification."
