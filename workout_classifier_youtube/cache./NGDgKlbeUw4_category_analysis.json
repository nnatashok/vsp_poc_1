  "categoriesExplanation": "1. **Pilates (Score: 0.9)**: The title explicitly mentions 'Pilates,' and the description details that the workout combines 'Pilates principles/movements.' The presence of tags such as 'pilates workout full body' and 'pilates for weight loss' strongly supports this as the primary category.\n\n2. **Mat (Score: 0.7)**: The workout is performed on a mat as indicated by the description's note on the 'Mat from Liforme.' This suggests bodyweight exercises and Pilates moves that are generally mat-based, consistent with channels focusing on these workouts.\n\n3. **Other (Score: 0.3)**: The workout includes 'cardio flows,' which might suggest elements not strictly limited to traditional Pilates. The comments mention a 'cardio burst,' indicating aerobic elements. However, these elements still integrate into the Pilates style, reducing their role to a supporting category position.\n\nThe high subscription base and channel focus on Pilates and Yoga confidently point to Pilates as the core category. The mention of a cardio aspect provides a faint secondary category under 'Other,' representing cardio-infused elements outside standard Pilates routines."
