  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Weight workout' with a high confidence score of 1.0 because the title ('60 Minute Full Body Dumbbell Workout [Strength Training]'), description, and tags highlight the use of dumbbells and focus on strength training, which is indicative of a weight workout. References to 'dumbbell workout', 'strength training', 'workout with dumbbells', and 'build muscle workout' support this categorization.\n\nA secondary classification of 'Body weight' with a score of 0.4 is possible because the video involves full body exercises, potentially incorporating bodyweight exercises as part of the routine, as suggested by the tag 'full body workout'. However, this element is less emphasized in the metadata, which is why it receives a lower score.\n\nNo sufficient evidence supports other categories, such as HIIT or Mat, as the focus clearly remains on strength and weight training with dumbbells."
