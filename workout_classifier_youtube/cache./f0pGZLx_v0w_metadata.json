    "For me the best WHM guided breathing I found until now. All others have static breathing countdowns, here we increase speed at own level. Additional I pause the video for longer breathholds. Thank you!",
    "Doing it at 5AM today, thanks for existing buddy",
    "Kitaro, I&#39;m two months sober and you have helped me every single day. Thank you for giving me this beautiful gift.",
    "It may be a little bit overwhelming for beginners, but it works like wonder. My anxiety was gone after two round, and positive thoughts started to pop up in my mind."
