  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is specifically tailored for beginners in calisthenics, as indicated by the title and comments praising its beginner-friendly nature and simplicity. The tutorial includes basic exercises like push-ups and pull-ups, which are beginner to intermediate level in terms of complexity. Additionally, any progression or variations explained likely increase the complexity slightly, justifying a partial inclusion of intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of over 25 minutes, the workout is moderately demanding, aligning with a likely moderate effort difficulty, especially given the 'building strength' theme. Beginners may find the transition to different muscle groups (push, pull, core, legs) challenging, but typical of a structured strength workout. The inclusion of several movement types supports a challenging classification for those new to workouts, increasing energy expenditure significantly.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The video is designed for beginners, but with a 25-minute duration and varied exercise types, it provides elements that fit intermediate users aiming to refine basics or build foundational strength. Advanced users might utilize this as a foundational or light session, particularly if returning to exercise. The technique requirements are simple enough to include beginners, but effort exertion guidelines push towards intermediate and partially advanced users."
