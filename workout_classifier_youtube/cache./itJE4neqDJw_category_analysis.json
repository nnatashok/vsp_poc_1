  "categoriesExplanation": "The video focuses on a 'full body stretch' as emphasized in the title and tags like 'daily stretch routine,' 'stretching,' 'stretching routine,' and 'mobility routine.' The description also highlights stretching for flexibility and mobility, suitable for various times of the day, which strongly supports the 'Stretching' category with a score of 0.9 for its central role.\n\nThe 'Yoga' category is also applicable with lesser emphasis due to references in tags like 'daily yoga routine' and 'quick stretch yoga.' The description does not thoroughly detail yoga-specific practices, which lessens the strength of this category, yet provides enough context for a 0.6 score, indicating it is a secondary element in the video.\n\nOther categories, such as 'Mat' or 'Body weight,' were considered but excluded due to the stronger emphasis on stretching and the lack of explicit indicators for general mat exercises or bodyweight training. The overall confidence in these classifications is high given the repeated emphasis on stretching throughout the metadata."
