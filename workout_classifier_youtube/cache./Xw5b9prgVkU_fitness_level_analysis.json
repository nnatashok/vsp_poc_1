  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes exercises such as tricep overhead extension, curl and press, sumo squats, renegade rows, and goblet squats, which generally require a moderate understanding of exercise technique and coordination, marking it as intermediate. Renegade rows and dead bugs, however, demand more core stability and coordination, potentially elevating them to advanced technique. Given the inclusion of modifications and the general accessibility of the workout's length, a primarily intermediate rating is appropriate, with a mild consideration for advanced.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 10 minutes, combined with high work intervals (60 seconds) and short rest periods (10 seconds), suggests a moderately challenging effort level. Various exercises target all major muscle groups, and potential dumbbell use increases energy expenditure. The intensity is heightened by the fast-paced nature of the workout, as highlighted by user comments noting significant physical exertion. Thus, it fits both moderate and challenging effort levels, especially for those less accustomed to high-intensity workouts.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Despite the intermediate to advanced technique requirements, the workout is short and modifications are available, making it accessible for beginners willing to adapt. User comments from less experienced individuals successfully completing the workout support this assessment. However, the intensity and complexity favor those with some fitness experience, accounting for the strong intermediate rating. Given the use of varied weights, more advanced participants can also be challenged, positioning the workout across beginner to advanced fitness levels. The structured progressions and user adaptability justify this multi-level approach."
