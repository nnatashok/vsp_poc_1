  "vibesExplanation": "The video is strongly indicative of 'The Warrior Workout' and 'The Firestarter' vibes. The title and description emphasize HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) and cardio, known for intense, sweat-dripping sessions typical of a 'Warrior Workout'. The repetitive use of high-intensity and explosive workout tags supports a strong match for these vibes, emphasizing the primal energy of the workout. The phrase 'burn fat fast' further suggests high energy expenditure, consistent with 'The Warrior Workout'. \n\nThe 'The Firestarter' vibe is also apt given the workout's short, explosive 10-minute duration, suggesting a fast and devastatingly intense session, suitable for those seeking effective short workouts. User comments and metadata note quick fat burning and significant body changes, aligning with this vibe.\n\nAn 'Endorphin Wave' vibe is moderately present, given the encouraging fat-burning success stories in the comments, pointing to the feel-good energy and transformative results achieved with consistency.\n\nOverall confidence is high (0.8) due to direct indications of intensity, fitness transformation, and user experiences shared in comments."
