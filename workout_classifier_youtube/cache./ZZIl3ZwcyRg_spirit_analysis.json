  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is strongly classified under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, earning a score of 0.9. This is supported by the title and description focusing on relieving pain and discomfort during pregnancy through stretching, a typical objective of restorative practices. User comments emphasize the relaxing nature of the stretches, with phrases like 'really enjoyed these relaxing stretches' and 'great for pregnancy headaches,' reinforcing this classification. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant, with a score of 0.7, as the video description and tags mention a routine, implying a continuous sequence of movements. Although not music-driven, comments like 'the music was great too' hint at a rhythm-focused approach, albeit less emphasized compared to its restorative nature.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to the gentle nature of the routine, which lacks the intensity, structural, athletic, or outdoor elements characteristic of other spirits."
