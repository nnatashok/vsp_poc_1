  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "I\u2019ve been working out with your videos for 15 months and words can\u2019t express how profoundly grateful I am for what you share so freely, lovingly and skillfully. My daily workouts with you have given me a pathway out of pain and into the strength I\u2019ve needed to maintain a pain-free existence. My deepest thanks and well wishes to you dear Nicole!",

I can now do this complete video. \ud83c\udf89 Surgery #2 is in two days, and I will go back to limitations for a while. But I am so happy that you have standing workouts and other tools that I can modify on my road to recovery. Nicole, my life is better for your work! Immeasurable gratitude sent your way."
