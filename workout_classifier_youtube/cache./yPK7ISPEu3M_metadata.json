    "I&#39;ve dismissed yoga for most of my life until I had spinal injuries from a car accident and overuse. Started following your earlier classes to ease my way into the practice. Now I do your classes 4-5 times a week and I feel amazing. Thank you Charlie! \u2764",
    "Was having a hard day. Decided to do yoga in the middle of my day. Chose this slow and couldn\u2019t have been more pleased. Always grateful. Thank you.",
    "A perfect flow for me!  Towards the end of the class I had the thought TWICE, &quot;this is awesome, but I&#39;ll have to do x pose after these mere 15 mins are finished&quot;.  And then you went and incorporated the pose!!  You are quickly becoming my favorite yoga teacher on YT.  THANK YOU Charlie!",
    "That was beautiful! A really thorough class in 15 mins. I feel set to start the day, and will be revisiting this class! Thanks so much Charlie for the care and love you put into your classes!",
    "Thank you so much Charlie for sharing your flows with us.  Excellent guidance and pace.  I start my day with 10-15 mins of yoga, it\u2019s a life changer. After 25+ years of pack pain from nursing (added in a daily 1 min plank too last year,omg the difference I now have in my core) and not had a flare in past 5 years!  \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9c"
