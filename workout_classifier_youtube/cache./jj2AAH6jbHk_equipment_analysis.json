  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"12 Minute Hip Mobility Routine (FOLLOW ALONG)\" suggests it's a bodyweight-only workout focused on hip flexibility and mobility. The metadata, including tags and the description, emphasizes terms like \"bodyweight,\" \"follow along,\" \"mobility routine,\" and \"hip mobility workout,\" which aligns with exercises typically performed without equipment. The main focus is on improving internal and external rotation of the hips and squat flexibility, usually accomplished with bodyweight exercises.\n\nComments and channel information do not suggest the use of any additional equipment. Additionally, the absence of specific equipment mentions in the title, description, and tags indicates a focus on accessible, bodyweight moves suitable for various environments. Thus, this analysis concludes no equipment is needed, rendering this a bodyweight-only workout."
