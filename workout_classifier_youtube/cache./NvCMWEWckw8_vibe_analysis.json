First, \"The Nightclub Workout\" vibe is apparent due to the hip-hop-themed cycling class, which emphasizes fun, high-energy beats, similar to a nightclub experience. The title and description emphasize the theme of hip-hop, complemented by a playlist of upbeat tracks clearly intended to enhance the workout's energetic nature. This vibe scores 0.7 due to these factors. Secondly, \"The Endorphin Wave\" is evident in its feel-good movement and steady build, emphasized by user comments reporting elation post-workout and significant weight loss progress, scoring 0.65. Lastly, \"The Groove Session\" got a score of 0.5 due to the rhythmic and flow state a cycling session with music can induce, evident from the dynamic playlist and users' enjoyment of movement. Other vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Firestarter\" were less applicable as the session is beginner-friendly and doesn't focus on raw intensity or heavily competitive elements."
