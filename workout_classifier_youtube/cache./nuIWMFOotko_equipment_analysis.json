  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video, titled 'Salamander Yoga! | 5-minute Yoga Break | Scratch Garden,' clearly implies yoga practice, which often requires a mat, particularly when certain poses are involved, such as 'mountain pose,' 'boat pose,' and 'cobra pose.' The description notes a relaxing and stretching routine comparable to yoga classes that typically utilize mats for comfort and support during floor exercises. Although the metadata does not explicitly specify a mat, the common usage of a mat in 'yoga for beginners,' '5-minute yoga flow,' and '5-minute yoga stretch' as seen in tags also supports its necessity. Thus, the confidence score for including a mat is high at 0.7."
