  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Quick But Brutal HIIT | 15 Minute Indoor Cycling Workout' fits primarily within the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to the explicit emphasis on high-intensity intervals and all-out efforts described in the metadata. The title itself describes the session as 'Brutal HIIT', which suggests a very challenging exercise routine designed to push physical limits, mirrored by comments praising its intensity (e.g., 'pushing us to the limit' and 'heart rate up'). Consequently, this spirit is assigned a high confidence score of 0.95.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also relevant due to the workout's methodical breakdown of specific time intervals and RPMs, suggesting a precise and organized approach to training. The detailed session breakdown in the description indicates a structured protocol, thus meriting an additional score of 0.7 for this spirit. Other spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were deemed inappropriate, as the workout's objective and comments suggested maximal effort and intensity rather than relaxation or fluidity."
