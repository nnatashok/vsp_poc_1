  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Zen Flow' due to the emphasis on a 'gentle yoga practice' which is beginner-friendly and designed for recovery, aligning well with qualities of grounding and breath-centered, unhurried movement. The use of phrases like 'gentle yoga practice', 'recover', 'stretch', and 'mental stillness' support this classification. Additionally, user comments describe the workout as 'short and sweet', 'relaxing', and leading to a decrease in bodily tension, which reinforces this vibe. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong match due to clear indicators in the description and user experiences.\n\nThe secondary vibe identified is 'The Reboot Workout', as the workout helps 'stretch and strengthen' while being easygoing, suitable for low-stress recovery days. Users report pain relief and feeling rejuvenated, characteristics associated with total-body refresh. The 0.75 score reflects these elements but acknowledges that the primary focus is on a peaceful, meditative practice rather than deep stretching or stress targeting."
