    "If you are just finding Kitaro now\u2026 he is a master of guided breathing meditation. I\u2019ve been Wim Hof breathing for over 5 years and I\u2019ve used many guided Wim Hof videos. HE\u2019S THE BEST\u2026 and in the words of Wim Hof, \u2018I hope you are all happy healthy and strong\u2019.",
    "Thank you so much \ud83d\ude4f <br><br>It made me believe again that there are beautiful souls out there ..",
    "Thank you, Kitaro. This makes for such a great start to my day!",
    "Hey kitaro, it would be nice if you put maybe 2 minutes of meditation in the end of the video where it&#39;s just pure silence. It&#39;s kind of annoying that I get interrupted by loud ads the moment the video finishes so I would appreciate it if you add this on your future videos. Cheers!",
    "This one is my favorite, with ONE EXCEPTION: there is no verbal cue to take a deep breath at the end of last hold. With my eyes closed, I had no idea I was in overtime when I couldn\u2019t hold it any longer! \ud83d\ude05"
