  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Guided Meditation For Powerful Positivity' does not indicate the need for any physical exercise equipment. Instead, it is centered around guided meditation, as evidenced by the title and description emphasizing peace, focus, and positivity through meditative practices. The tags also confirm that this is a meditation session, not a physical workout, with no equipment mentioned at all. The description suggests needing only a quiet space and headphones to fully engage with the meditation, without any reference to physical equipment normally used in workouts or yoga. Thus, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, or in this case, a non-physical meditation session requiring no additional equipment."
