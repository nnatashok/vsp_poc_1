  "title": "40 Minute Guided Breathing Meditation for Deep Relaxation and Inner Stillness",
  "description": "To skip intro click here: 00:37\n\nThis is a long 40 minute guided meditation, focussing on using the breath to help you sink beneath distractions into a spacious inner stillness. There's 30 minutes of guided breathing and deep relaxation, followed by 10 minutes of pure stillness. \n\nIf you'd like a shorter version here's a 15 minute version of this meditation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Undv6MmQeE&feature=youtu.be\n\nYou can sit or lie down...\n\nIf you\u2019re on the floor:\nSit with your legs crossed. Sit on the edge of a big cushion (or a couple of pillows) so that your hips are slightly higher than your knees (this helps keep your back upright and supports your lower back). Rest your hands wherever they feel most comfortable on your knees, thighs or in your lap. \n\nIf you\u2019re on a chair:\nSit with your legs at least shoulder width apart with the soles of your feet flat against the floor (or with your legs crossed meditation style if the seat is big enough and you're comfortable). Sit with your back unsupported or supported by the back of the chair with a cushion in the small of your back. Rest your hands wherever they feel most comfortable on your knees, thighs or in your lap. \n\nLying down:\nLie on your back. If you have any trouble with your lower back try placing a pillow beneath your knees, or lie with your knees bent towards the ceiling and the soles of your feet flat on the surface you're lying on. Rest your hands by your sides, or resting lightly on your lower stomach.\n\nIs it better to sit on the floor, a chair or lie down? - This depends on how you're best able to find a balance between being comfortable and alert. Meditation is a state of both relaxation and focussed attention, so find a position that you will be as comfortable as possible in as well as being able to focus on your breathing without falling asleep (unless you want to of course!).\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n\r\r\rThanks for listening.
