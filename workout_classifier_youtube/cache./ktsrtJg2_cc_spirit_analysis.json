  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Morning mobility stretches for beginners' is primarily categorized under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a score of 0.95. This classification is supported by the focus on 'gentle stretches and movements' designed to 'improve flexibility and boost your energy levels' as mentioned in the description. The emphasis on 'beginners' and the 'morning mobility' aspect suggest it's a calming routine aimed at refreshing the body. Additionally, the high engagement reflected in comments appreciating its suitability for older participants and those looking for a gentle start further cements its restorative nature.\n\nThe second spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm,' is assigned a score of 0.65. This is due to the 'easy-to-follow exercises' which indicate a smooth and continuous movement style typical in Flow & Rhythm workouts. The mention of a 'morning routine' also suggests a consistent pattern and a rhythmic aspect to the exercises.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the lack of high-intensity elements or sports-specific skills mentioned in the metadata."
