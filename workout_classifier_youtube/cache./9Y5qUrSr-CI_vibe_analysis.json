  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe due to its focus on Pilates, which emphasizes technique and precise control. The description mentions an 'Intermediate' level, suggesting a skill-building approach, typical of a Masterclass, although the intensity is not extreme, thus warranting a score of 0.6.\n\n'Foundation Builder' is selected with a score of 0.7 as the workout aims to strengthen core (a fundamental part of fitness). The video title and description highlight 'core' and 'abs,' suggesting a focus on building essential strength. The channel emphasizes sustainable results and consistency, aligning with building a strong foundation. The mention of progress tracking tools and personalized training supports this vibe, hence the higher score.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush' were excluded due to the Pilates format's typical low-intensity, controlled nature. The description and comments do not suggest a high-energy or unpredictable workout experience, thus these vibes were dismissed."
