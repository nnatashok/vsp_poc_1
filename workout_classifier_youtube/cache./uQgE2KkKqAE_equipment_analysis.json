  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"5 Minute Guided Box Breathing For Stress & Anxiety\" from the channel \"Breathe With Sandy\" does not require any physical equipment typically associated with workout routines. The focus of the video is on guided breathing exercises, specifically box breathing, a form of pranayama. The description and tags emphasize breathing techniques and meditation without mentioning or implying the use of any physical equipment.\n\nThe tags include phrases like \"box breathing meditation\" and \"guided breathing,\" and the description highlights creating a calm, stress-free environment by recommending headphones for an enhanced audio experience. No mentions of mats, weights, bands, or any other fitness equipment are made.\n\nThe user comments further affirm this focus on breathwork and meditation, indicating no reliance on physical equipment. The overall emphasis is on mental relaxation and control of anxiety rather than physical exercise that would require equipment. Thus, my analysis concludes that this session is bodyweight only."
