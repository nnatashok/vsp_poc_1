  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to its Pilates nature, emphasized by smooth and continuous movement patterns characteristic of mind-body connection workouts. The use of terms like 'Pilates' and the video being music-driven supports this choice, with a score of 0.75. 'Soothing & Restorative' is also apt, as evidenced by comments highlighting the relaxing nature of the workout without timers, allowing participants to stay in the zone and focus on stress release, warranting a score of 0.7. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is supported by the precise nature of Pilates and the comments discussing the structured yet relaxing formulation of the workout, justifying a score of 0.6. The workout lacks high-intensity elements and sports-specific training components, so those spirits are excluded."
