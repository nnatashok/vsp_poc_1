    "Yes! If you guys like this style of workout video, we can do more like this (in additional to our normal, voiced-over workouts) and possibly, hopefully, hypothetically speaking, bring you even more new workout videos :)",
    "We thought so too! We were a bit nervous for this first one so I am sure there&#39;s a bit of a learning curve, audio will get better, etc. It was actually really hard to remember not to say smart alec things to each other haha",
    "Still one of the most effective upper body workout so far!",
    "Thank you! And you know you&#39;re setting an awesome example for your kids by working out and treating your body well!",
    "I actually really loved this one! My upper body is completely toast. I normally have a hard time targeting muscles on my upper body, but after so many sets I feel like I hit everything!"
