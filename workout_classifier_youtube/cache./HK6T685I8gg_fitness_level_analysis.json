  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a guided meditation, which fundamentally involves very simple, static physical activity that requires minimal body movement or coordination. Meditation primarily focuses on mental engagement and breathing, with no physical complexity. Therefore, it aligns strongly with 'Beginner' for technique difficulty, as meditation involves straightforward sitting or lying positions and breathing guidance.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given that the routine is a meditation practice, it is ideally suited for Beginners due to the minimal physical involvement. However, since meditation can be complex emotionally and mentally, it also appeals to Intermediate and Advanced practitioners who might use it for deepening mindfulness or spiritual connections, hence a slight inclusion of Intermediate and Advanced levels as extensions of personal practice depth."
