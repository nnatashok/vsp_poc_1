  "categoriesExplanation": "The main category assigned is 'Pilates' with a score of 0.9 due to multiple strong indicators in the metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'FULL BODY PILATES' and the tags such as 'pilates workout', 'full body pilates workout', and 'pilates exercises' heavily emphasize the Pilates nature of the workout. Additionally, the channel focuses on providing Pilates content, further supporting this categorization. \n\nThe 'Weight workout' category is also relevant with a score of 0.7 as the description and title indicate the use of weights: 'full body pilates workout with weights' and 'intense 15 minute at home pilates workout class'. The mention of 'burn fat with exercises that use weights' in the description reinforces this categorization. \n\nConfidence in these categories is high (0.85) due to clear evidence from the title, description, tags, and the channel's focus, all of which strongly point towards Pilates with light weight incorporation in this workout."
