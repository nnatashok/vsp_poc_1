  "categoriesExplanation": "The title '15 Minute Gentle Full Body Stretch' and tags such as 'full body stretching,' 'gentle stretch,' and 'stretch workout for beginners' strongly indicate a Stretching category with a high confidence score of 0.9. The video and channel description stress a gentle full-body stretch routine to improve flexibility and relieve tension, which aligns with the Stretching category. The mention of 'gentle pilates workout' in the tags and the content creator being a Pilates teacher justify a secondary classification as Pilates, though at a lower score of 0.6, as the focus appears primarily on stretching rather than Pilates exercises. References to the commingling of Pilates techniques with stretching-based sessions, alongside channel focus, suggest this additional Pilates element. The 'Other' category is included at a very low score (0.2) due to the potential mixing of techniques but is not strongly supported due to the lack of evidence for any unique or distinguishable component not covered by the primary categories."
