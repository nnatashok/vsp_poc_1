    "I didn&#39;t take it seriously at first and started laughing (Im not use to doing meditation) and this meditation became so heavenly it made me cry. I actually started to envision my future husband and kids literally at the corridor. Then I experienced chills and goosebumps (never had that before). Amazing \u2764",
    "Imagining myself as the most loving and self-actualized person I can be is so much better than imagining myself being rich or famous. This was so refreshing to my heart and is motivating me to meditate more. Thanks!",
    "We are the masters of our own fate. Write your story",
    "I work from home and have been feeling a bit depressed from a lack of human interaction and fulfillment. This meditation took me to a regular day of me coming home from an honest days work and being greeted by my wife and kids. So simple yet so powerful for my soul. It showed me that those are the moments I am truly grateful for and desire. A fulfilling job to be proud of and a loving family to come home to. Thank you god for putting this video in my path today and thank you to the creator of this video. Will definitely be tuning in more often.",
    "My reading today suggested concentrating on solutions not problems. I truly believe that us how we step up to a higher version of ourself and help those around us do the same,<br>May Love light and happiness fill your day!"
