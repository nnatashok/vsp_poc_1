  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves basic strength exercises combined with isometric holds, which adds a layer of complexity beyond simple movements. The need to maintain proper form during these movements, particularly with weights, requires some coordination and body awareness. However, the exercises are not described as overly technical or advanced, aligning more with an intermediate level of technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of 25 minutes and combination of strength exercises and isometric holds imply a moderate effort level. The description suggests starting with light weights and possibly repeating the workout, indicating a variable intensity. The inclusion of isometric holds and strength focus could push the effort towards challenging, particularly for deconditioned individuals trying to maintain effort over the full duration.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.75,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the technique and effort difficulties, the workout accommodates multiple fitness levels due to the adjustable nature of dumbbell weights. Beginners can use lighter weights to manage the effort difficulty, while the inclusion of isometric holds and full-body engagement suits intermediate users seeking more challenge. The workout's duration slightly reduces its suitability for complete beginners but remains accessible because of potential modifications. Advanced users would benefit from heavier weights or repeated rounds as suggested in the description."
