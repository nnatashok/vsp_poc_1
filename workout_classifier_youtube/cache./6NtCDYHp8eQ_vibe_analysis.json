  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe 'The Comfort Moves' (score: 0.85) is strongly indicated by the workout being designed for seniors, focusing on 'beginner low impact exercises' and 'chair workout.' These elements emphasize comfort, accessibility, and inclusivity for individuals with mobility considerations. The presence of phrases like 'get your body moving' and comments from seniors adjusting to exercise routines reinforce this classification. 'The Meditative Grind' (score: 0.65) vibe was chosen because the workout involves methodical, repetitive motions, typical of 'low impact exercises' and a structured format with rest intervals, which pair mental focus with physical activity. Additionally, the channel's emphasis on 'building up a programme' supports the idea of an ongoing, steady exercise routine. Lastly, 'The Reboot Workout' (score: 0.5) reflects the video's potential to serve as a refreshing break, with minimal stress and gentle movements, as observed in the comment feedback and the format of '5-minute HIIT Workout No Jumping.' Other vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Warrior Workout' were not considered due to the non-primal, non-competitive nature of the session, and its focus on beginner-level, low-intensity exercises."
