  "vibesExplanation": "The video, titled '10 MINUTE MORNING WORKOUT (NO EQUIPMENT)', is described as a full-body, equipment-free routine to be done in the morning, suggesting a vibe of repetitive movement and a steady energy build, indicative of 'The Endorphin Wave.' The focus on getting muscles warm and loose, coupled with the inclusion of rest breaks, supports a moderate intensity level aligning with this vibe (score: 0.7).\n\nAdditionally, the workout's design around routines that incorporate various exercises like jumping jacks, bodyweight squats, and push-ups, suggests a repetitive, methodical approach, a hallmark of 'The Meditative Grind' (score: 0.7). This vibe fits well as users might routinely start their day with these exercises to get into the flow.\n\nFurthermore, 'The Disciplined Grind' is also applicable (score: 0.6), as the inclusion of a structured routine first thing in the morning, characterized as intense and motivating by the tags and comments, suggests a disciplined commitment to improving fitness consistently.\nOverall, these vibes are supported by the routine's focus, user comments about motivation and results, and the rhythmic, structured flow of exercises."
