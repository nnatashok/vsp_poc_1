  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is predominantly a 'Meditation' session, as evidenced by the title 'The Powerful Release of Letting Go! Guided Meditation', which directly mentions meditation. The tags also reinforce this, with terms such as 'guided meditation', 'meditation', and 'letting go meditation'. These suggest a focus on mindfulness and guided relaxation, key aspects of meditation. This warrants a high score of 0.9 for the 'Meditation' category. \n\nAdditionally, the description emphasizes mental and spiritual practices associated with letting go, typically central to meditation methods aimed at cultivating inner peace, lending further confidence to this classification. However, practices such as 'releasing our fears, doubts, and worries' suggest possible elements of 'Breathing exercises', although the primary focus is not on breathing techniques, granting it a lower score of 0.3 as a secondary category. Other categories like 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were excluded as there is no mention of physical postures or flexibility training."
