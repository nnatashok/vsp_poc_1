  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified predominantly as 'The Zen Flow' due to its grounding, intentional, and breath-centered approach. The metadata includes a focus on yoga asanas and pranayama practices like 'Aum chanting' and 'Anulom Vilom,' which emphasize calming the mind and focusing on breath (supported by the description of the exercises and the comment about mental peace and calmness). The title and description explicitly mention a 'calm mind,' reinforcing the vibe's grounding and unhurried qualities. The 'Reboot Workout' vibe is also applicable as the description and exercises indicate a rejuvenating and refreshing experience, supported by comments noting mental peace and physical benefits. The selection of gentle, calming yoga poses and breathing exercises aligns with both vibes, but the stronger emphasis on mindfulness and breath supports a primary classification as 'The Zen Flow.' The high confidence score of 0.9 reflects clear indicators in multiple data points, with emotional impacts described by users and the video presenter."
