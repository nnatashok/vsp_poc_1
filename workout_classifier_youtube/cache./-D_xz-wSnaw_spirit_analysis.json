  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout in question emphasizes a '60 MIN (FULL BODY) WALKING CARDIO & STRENGTH WORKOUT' that adheres to a 'low impact HIIT' style, utilizing clearly defined intervals ('45 seconds on, 15 seconds rest'), which suggests a strong component of 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (score: 0.75). The specific timings, along with the detailed section division (30 min cardio & 25 min strength), highlight a methodical approach to exercise.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.6) is supported by the 'Walking Cardio' aspect of the workout, suggesting a smooth, continuous movement pattern. The description notes music-driven pacing ('I will guide you through every move'), suggesting an element of coordination and movement flow, although not the primary focus.\n\nThe workout's high-intensity theme ('HIIT', 'boost intensity the second time around', and 'high-intensity interval training') indicates elements of 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit (score: 0.55). However, the explicit mention of 'low impact' alongside the workout being suitable for 'women over 50' and beginners tempers the intensity.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure', 'Soothing & Restorative', and 'Sport & Agility' spirits are less relevant here due to the workout's indoor focus, absence of recovery emphasis, and non-sport-specific nature."
