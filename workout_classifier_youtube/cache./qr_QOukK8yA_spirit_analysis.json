  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classed primarily under 'High-Energy & Intense' due to phrases like 'intensity', 'epic 60 minute ride', and 'calorie burner' seen in the title and description, along with the use of keywords such as 'extreme', 'high intensity', and 'intense' in the tags, indicating a vigorous session typical of intense indoor cycling routines (score of 0.85). The mention of 'two focussed blocks of intensity and a strong finish' in the description supports the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, indicating a planned, systematic workout structure (score of 0.75). Finally, there is mention of a playlist with multiple tracks, suggesting a 'Flow & Rhythm' component, commonly emphasized in music-driven classes; though it's more of a supplementary aspect here (score of 0.5). 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the indoor, non-sport-specific nature of the workout. Overall, confidence in this classification is high due to clear indicators in both the workout metadata and typical content style of the channel."
