  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled '15 MIN FULL BODY STRETCH - Improve Mobility and Flexibility' and its description indicate a focus on recovery, flexibility, and mobility improvements, which aligns strongly with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The title explicitly mentions a 'stretch' routine aimed at improving 'mobility' and 'flexibility,' terms commonly associated with restorative health practices. The description emphasizes recovery and the importance of making it a part of weekly routines, further supporting the restorative classification. The mention of this being suitable for all levels, with no equipment needed, suggests it's designed to be a gentle workout, again characteristic of restorative exercises. Thus, this spirit is assigned a high score of 0.9.\n\nA secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm,' is moderately present due to the 'smooth stretch routine' mentioned, implying a flowing sequence of movements. However, while this element is present, it is less central than the restorative focus, giving it a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nThe video lacks indicators of high intensity, structure, sport specificity, or outdoor elements, which exclude it from those categories."
