  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit identified is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a score of 0.7, due to the integration of Pilates with standing cardio, and the emphasis on continuous, low-impact movement suggests a focus on coordination and rhythm. This is supported by the use of phrases like 'no jumping,' 'standing pilates,' and 'burn fat and tone muscles,' which imply smooth and structured exercises aligned with music or breath. \n\n'High-Energy & Intense' is scored at 0.6, reflecting the cardio component intended to 'raise your heart rate' and 'boost the metabolism,' as highlighted in the description. While the session is low-impact, it's still designed to be fairly engaging and energizing, indicated by tags like 'standing fat burning exercise' and comments about 'huffing and puffing.' \n\nA score of 0.4 for 'Soothing & Restorative' is given as the workout includes a 'Warm Up and Cool Down Stretch,' suggesting an element of calming and recovery. This mixed approach in the workout offers gentle exertion while still prioritizing participant well-being, as appreciated by an older audience in the comments."
