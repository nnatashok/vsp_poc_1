  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as 'pregnancy safe', 'gentle', and suitable for all trimesters, indicating a focus on low-impact movements that prioritize safety and simplicity, characteristic of beginner-level techniques. Additionally, the use of standing exercises without complex coordination or equipment needs aligns with beginner technique difficulty. However, the inclusion of options for all fitness levels and the capacity for moderate intensity suggests some movements may align with intermediate technique levels, especially with respect to posture and balance adjustments during pregnancy.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "As it is a prenatal workout described as 'gentle yet effective,' with safety and inclusivity emphasized for various trimesters, the effort difficulty is primarily light. Yet, the metadata includes 'beginner workout' and 'cardio', suggesting some moderate energy expenditure might occur for users new to fitness or those in later pregnancy stages. The 24-minute duration slightly pushes the effort towards moderate for some users, especially deconditioned ones or those managing pregnancy weight.",

User comments praise its suitability for deconditioned users, including those with health conditions, reinforcing the focus on accessibility. However, the Beginner and Intermediate guides, suggested as complementary materials, hint at inclusivity of different fitness baselines, thereby supporting some users operating at an 'Intermediate' level who may seek more intensity within provided options."
