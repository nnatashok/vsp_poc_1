  "categoriesExplanation": "The video title and description strongly indicate that this is a 'Full Body Stretch' routine, emphasizing flexibility, mobility, and relaxation, key attributes of the 'Stretching' category. This is reinforced by the tags 'full body stretch', 'deep stretch', and 'mobility'. Therefore, 'Stretching' is classified as the primary category with a high confidence level of 0.9.\n\nWhile the routine includes elements of mindfulness and positions that align with 'Yoga', the primary focus appears to be on stretching rather than traditional yoga postures. The channel\u2019s description, highlighting Mady Morrison\u2019s background as a yoga instructor, and the tag 'yoga' provide additional evidence for classifying it under 'Yoga', though with a lower focus (0.7) because the core activity is stretching.\n\nThere is a slight inclusion of 'Other' due to the video having elements of relaxation and music-led sessions that can be somewhat open-ended, but this is minor with a score of 0.1. The lack of instructed yoga poses or typical breathing exercises reduces strong classification in these secondary categories."
