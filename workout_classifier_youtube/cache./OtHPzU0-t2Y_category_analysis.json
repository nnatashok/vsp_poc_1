  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized primarily as 'Breathing exercises' with a score of 0.9, substantiated by multiple mentions in the title ('Breathing Exercises'), tags ('breathing exercises for anxiety', 'breathing exercises yoga'), and description emphasizing breath control and daily breathing exercises. This suggests a strong focus on breathing practices for health benefits like reducing stress and improving lung capacity. The 'Meditation' category is also relevant with a score of 0.5 as the description alludes to mental focus and balance, which are key aspects of meditative practices, although explicit meditation activities are not detailed. Additionally, 'Yoga' is identified with a score of 0.4 due to the channel's focus on yoga and the use of tags like 'breathing exercises yoga' and 'Saurabh Bothra yoga', suggesting an overlap with yoga practices. The confidence level is high (0.85) because of pervasive references to breathing and related practices in the video metadata."
