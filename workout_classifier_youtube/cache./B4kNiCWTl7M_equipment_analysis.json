  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a 22-minute gentle yoga practice, as indicated by the title '22 Minute Full Body Gentle Yoga Practice for Beginners and Athletes' and various mentions in the description. This suggests that the primary activity is yoga, which typically requires a mat for comfort and support during floor exercises. While the specific mention of a mat is not present, the nature of yoga practices strongly implies its necessity. The tag 'vinyasa yoga' and 'yoga practice' further support this interpretation. Therefore, I assigned a high confidence score of 0.7 for the use of a mat. Other equipment is not mentioned or implied, indicating this is a minimalist, mat-based yoga routine."
