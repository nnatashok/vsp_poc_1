  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as Moderate due to the 30-minute duration of a vinyasa flow, which combines flexibility and strength elements without props. This suggests a moderate energy expenditure. There is some indication of a Challenging effort level due to the practice being intended to energize and wake up the body, powerfully fitting 'morning yoga' and 'energetic' contexts. Comments also suggest a significant engagement level, indicating it might be more demanding for less conditioned users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.7,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is Intermediate with a tendency towards Advanced. The classification is driven by the intermediate technique and moderate to challenging effort involved, which aligns with an audience that has some yoga experience but might be engaging in such a routine regularly due to its full-body and dynamic nature. The duration and user comments supporting its calming yet challenging nature also suggest that beginners could attempt it, but with reduced engagement or modifications, thus justifying a note on the Beginner level."
