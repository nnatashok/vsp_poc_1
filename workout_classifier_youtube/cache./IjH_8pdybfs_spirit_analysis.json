  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled 'POST-WORKOUT STRETCH for Injury Prevention & Flexibility' predominantly embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This classification is supported by the emphasis on 'Stretch,' 'Injury Prevention,' and 'Flexibility' in the title, indicating a focus on recovery and relaxation rather than high-intensity or structured effort. The presence of terms like 'post-workout stretch' and comments describing the stretch as 'calming' and contributing to improved mobility further support this spirit assignment. The description includes a disclaimer about consulting a physician, typical for workouts emphasizing recovery and safety.\n\nAdditionally, there is a mild element of 'Flow & Rhythm,' scored at 0.5, due to the smooth and continuous nature of stretching routines that naturally involve a degree of flow and mindful movement. This is bolstered by comments appreciating the instructor's guidance and soothing voice, suggesting a connectivity between mind and body during the session.\n\nPotential spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the lack of intensity or specific technical focus evidenced by the video\u2019s title, content, and user comments."
