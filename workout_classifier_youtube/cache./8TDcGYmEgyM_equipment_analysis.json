  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a guided sleep meditation focused on relaxation and combating insomnia. The title, description, and tags emphasize themes of meditation, sleep talk-down, ocean wave sounds, and relaxation. There is no mention of any physical exercises or equipment needs. Additionally, user comments and channel information further confirm that the content is centered around meditation and audio-guided relaxation, with no physical exercise involved. Thus, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, specifically for mental relaxation, and no equipment is required."
