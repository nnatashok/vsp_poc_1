  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned to this workout is 'Indoor biking', with a score of 1.0. This classification is strongly supported by the title 'Quick & INTENSE 10-minute Cycling Workout', and further reinforced by the channel name 'Kaleigh Cohen Cycling', which indicates a specialization in cycling workouts. The description explicitly mentions a cycling workout that is designed to enhance muscular strength and cardiovascular endurance, while involving variable resistance and speed, typical of indoor cycling sessions. \n\nAdditionally, the category 'HIIT' is assigned a score of 0.7. Although the description does not explicitly mention high-intensity intervals, the emphasis on resistance and speed variations, the 10-minute time frame, and the intense nature implied by the word 'INTENSE' suggest a HIIT component as this style commonly involves short, intense bursts of activity.\n\nThe comments and channel focus further support these classifications, as they highlight personal experiences with the intensity and motivational aspects of the session, consistent with both indoor biking and HIIT workouts."
