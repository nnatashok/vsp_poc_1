  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as 'Pilates' with very high confidence, indicated by both the title \"DEEP CORE ACTIVATION CHALLENGE (Pilates Abs)\" and repeated mentions of 'Pilates' in the tags and description. The channel itself features Pilates exercises regularly, and the host, Lilly Sabri, is an APPI Pilates instructor, further supporting this classification. The workout focuses on 'deep core activation', a common theme in Pilates, which emphasizes controlled movements and core strength.\n\nAdditionally, 'Body weight' is also a relevant category because the workout is performed without external weights or equipment, relying on body weight for resistance, consistent with 'home workout' and 'abs workout' tags. The video duration of 8 minutes fits typical core and abs bodyweight routines, as highlighted in the title and description.\n\nThe strong focus on Pilates terms and techniques in both the video content and channel theme outweighs other potential categories such as 'Calisthenics' or general 'Mat' workouts, ensuring a high confidence in these chosen classifications."
