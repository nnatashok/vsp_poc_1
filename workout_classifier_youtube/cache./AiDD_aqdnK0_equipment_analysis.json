  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title \"HIIT - 35 Minute Cycle Training Workout - Hill Training\" and description clearly indicate that the workout is a cycling session. It is described as an indoor training session specifically for a \"turbo trainer or static bike,\" which are both types of exercise bikes designed for indoor cycling. The tags also include terms like \"Cycling,\" \"Turbo session,\" and \"Bike,\" further reinforcing the central role of an exercise bike in this workout. Therefore, the equipment required is an \"Exercise bike,\" with very high confidence (1.0) since it is explicitly central to the workout."
