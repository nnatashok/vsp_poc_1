  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video '30 MIN PILATES FOR BEGINNERS || Full Body Workout (No Equipment)' by Move With Nicole is best classified under multiple workout spirits. \n\nFirstly, the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit scores highly (0.75) due to the inherent nature of Pilates, which emphasizes smooth, continuous movements and coordination. The title and description suggest a seamless full-body approach, while the channel's roots in dance further support this classification. \n\nSecondly, 'Structured & Disciplined' is a strong presence (0.7). The video is a well-laid-out, 30-minute session focused on beginners, emphasizing precision and methodical progression in exercises, as noted in user comments appreciating the focus on form and manageability.\n\nFinally, 'Soothing & Restorative' scores moderately (0.55), as the beginner-friendly, no-equipment nature of Pilates, coupled with the calming influence described in comments and from the instructor's background, suggests a gentle, stress-reducing atmosphere. \n\nHigher intensity spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded, as the video targets beginners and relaxation, rather than pushing physical limits or sports-specific training."
