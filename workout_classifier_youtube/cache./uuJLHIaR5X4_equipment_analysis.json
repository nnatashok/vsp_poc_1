  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The equipment required for this workout is the Elliptical, with a very high confidence level of 1.0. The video title, '10 Minute HIIT Express Elliptical Workout,' explicitly indicates that an elliptical machine is central to the workout. Additionally, the description encourages viewers to 'hop on your elliptical or cardio climber' and follow along with interval training. The tags also reinforce this, mentioning 'elliptical workout,' 'elliptical trainer,' and 'elliptical machine,' which confirm the equipment focus. The description even lists a specific model of an elliptical machine (Motorized Elliptical Machine SF-E3875) used in the workout. Therefore, it is clear that an elliptical is necessary to perform this workout effectively."
