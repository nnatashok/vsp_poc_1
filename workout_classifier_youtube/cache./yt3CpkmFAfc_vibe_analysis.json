  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Physio Neck Exercises Stretch & Relieve Routine' by Michelle Kenway is best characterized by 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, scoring 0.9. This is due to the focus on relieving neck and shoulder tension through gentle stretching exercises designed to refresh and reset the body, as stated in the title and description. The emphasis on deep stretches and a relaxed approach aligns well with a 'reboot' experience.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Comfort Moves' vibe scores 0.8, as the workout is presented in a soothing manner, specifically targeting individuals with neck pain or tension, often associated with comfort and relief from discomfort. The video's purpose to safely guide viewers via basic, gentle exercises supports this classification.\n\nFinally, 'The Foundation Builder' scores 0.5, reflecting a moderate match. Although the workout does emphasize the basics and proper posture correction, its primary focus is on relieving immediate discomfort rather than foundational strength improvement. This leads to a secondary vibe classification in this area."
