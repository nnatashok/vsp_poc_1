  "vibesExplanation": "The title, \"Box Breathing Exercise | TAKE A DEEP BREATH | Pranayama Series,\" and description emphasize stress relief, anxiety reduction, and the Pranayama technique, which strongly indicates a calming and grounding experience typical of \"The Zen Flow\" vibe. This is supported by the description's focus on breath control as a tool for stress relief and relaxation, a hallmark of Zen and breath-centered practices, warranting a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe description and comments also suggest elements of nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement, aligning with \"The Deep Recharge\" vibe. Words like \"relaxation,\" \"calm your parasympathetic nervous system,\" and user comments describing feelings of euphoria after the practice support a moderate score of 0.7 for \"The Deep Recharge.\"\n\n\"The Mindful Walk\" vibe is partially represented through the mindfulness meditation aspect and encouragement to \"be present\" during the exercise, indicative of an immersive and meditative experience. However, without the story-driven or walking elements typically associated with this vibe, it only scores 0.5.\n\nOther vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Firestarter\" are excluded due to the absence of high-intensity or explosive elements."
