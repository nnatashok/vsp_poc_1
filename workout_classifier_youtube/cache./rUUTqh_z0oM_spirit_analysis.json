  "spiritsExplanation": "The video primarily embodies the Flow & Rhythm spirit, as indicated by the use of music to accompany treadmill running, creating a continuous and engaging exercise experience. The description supports this with phrases like 'With Fitness Music' and comments about how the video makes the treadmill experience more lively and engaging. The emphasis on rhythmic coordination aligns with this spirit, earning a score of 0.7 for Strong match.\n\nAdditionally, the Outdoor & Adventure spirit is present because the video incorporates virtual scenic visuals of Budapest, Hungary, creating an exploratory and nature-oriented backdrop. The title and description highlight the setting and sights in 'Budapest, Hungary', and the tags include 'treadmill virtual scenery' and 'virtual workout,' reinforcing the virtual exploration aspect. Thus, it scores 0.6, indicating that these elements are clearly present, although the adventure is virtual.\n\nHigh-Energy & Intense and other spirits were excluded, as the video lacks explicit indicators of rigorous intensity or athletic performance focus, aligning more with a scenic workout experience."
