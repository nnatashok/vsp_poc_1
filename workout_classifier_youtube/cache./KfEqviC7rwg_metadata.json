    "To whomever reads this. <br>I may not know you, but I love you.<br><br>We are one",
    "Whoever\u2019s reading this, I hope something really wonderful happens to you today!!!",
    "I can&#39;t believe that in this gigantic universe, I had the privilege of experiencing this little piece that I somehow stumbled upon. <br>I have severe control issues revolving around controlling myself, my breathing, my walking, my every second of being. I like to be safe always. I am not a fan of change. I always feel very small. But right now, I feel more alive than I have ever before, and here in my small room I feel very big and deserving. <br>If you are reading this comment to wonder if you should give this meditation a try, then please just go and play it. <br>I love you.",
    "Everyone coming on to here seems to be in some form of pain. My heart goes out to all of you. Right now I myself am struggling with a relapse of anxiety, depression, and ocd that has seen me in the hospital, starting on meds and in the care of multidisciplinary help. To those who are in the midst of their own battles, I urge you to be strong. We can do this. Much love x"
