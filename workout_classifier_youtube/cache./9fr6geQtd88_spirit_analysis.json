  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is primarily a guided meditation focused on manifesting positive realities and self-reflection, which aligns strongly with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The use of calming language in the description, such as phrases like 'open to receiving all the positive energy' and 'trust in the universe's guidance' point to relaxation and stress reduction. The channel's consistent production of meditation content further supports this classification. User comments expressing emotional reactions and feelings of refreshment, peace, and motivation reinforce the restorative nature of this session. The absence of physical exertion or training structure excludes the other spirits, making 'Soothing & Restorative' a nearly perfect fit for the workout spirit."
