  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title of the video explicitly states \"no equipment,\" indicating that the workout can be performed without any additional tools or props, confirming it is intended for bodyweight exercises only. The description and channel information do not mention any equipment requirements either, and user comments focus on the effectiveness of the workout rather than the use of any specific equipment. The channel specializes in Pilates, and the creator is a certified Pilates mat instructor, which suggests a focus on mat-based exercises, likely performed without other equipment. Therefore, it appears the workout relies on bodyweight exercises alone."
