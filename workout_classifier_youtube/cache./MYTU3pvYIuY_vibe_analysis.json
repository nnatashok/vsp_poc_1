  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe, 'The Warrior Workout' (score: 0.9), is supported by the video's intense and challenging nature as indicated by the title 'KILLER HIIT WORKOUT' and tags like 'fat burning workout', 'intense hiit', and 'calorie killer'. The circuit training format and emphasis on sweat and calorie burn reaffirm the warrior-like, intense nature. The demanding structure (50 sec work, 10 sec rest) and user comments celebrating progress despite difficulty strengthen this classification.\n\n'The Adrenaline Rush' (score: 0.65) is another relevant vibe due to the elements of unpredictability and intensity suggested by the varied, high-energy exercises mentioned in comments, like burpee variations, which maintain high engagement and excitement.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Firestarter' were considered but excluded due to the longer duration and structured circuit format that focuses more on sustained effort rather than short explosive bursts."
