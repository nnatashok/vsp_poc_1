    "READ FIRST: If using only your left nostril is too difficult, use both nostrils for this exercise. And if your nose is blocked, use your mouth. There\u2019s no right way, listen to your body and enjoy \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",
    "Good morning, I was diagnosed with Pots syndrome 6 months ago.  At first, when I found this breathing exercise video i was doing the exercises beacuse i was told i had anxiety. The breathing alone got me a long way with my POTS symptoms without me realizing it. I wish i could do this breathing exercises all day long to keep my nervous system relax, thank you so much for sharing this video with those of us that need it the most \ud83d\ude4f",
    "For the person experiencing menstruation, i find that it really helps me with pain management ! I did it with both nostrils in the inhale and exhaled with the mouth. I also recommend using a hot water bottle on the belly, raspberry leaf tea and doing light yoga and/or walking. Hoping this can help someone \ud83e\udd0d I really love your videos Sandy, keep up the good work :)",
    "Thank you for your help. I have had anxiety since I was a child . Started meditating and prayer along with your breathing exercises and my anxiety is almost gone! I consider this a miracle. I wish I had known this when I was a practicing nurse I could have helped so many. God bless you and your work.",
