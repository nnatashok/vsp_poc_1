  "spiritsExplanation": "This video is predominantly classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.95, which reflects the focus on relaxation and stress relief through meditation. The title '15 Minute Guided Meditation | Clear & Calm The Mind In Uncertain Times' and the description emphasize calming the mind and coping with stress and anxiety. Phrases like 'clear and calm the mind,' 'perfect tool to help cope with the uncertainty,' and 'cleanse and heal yourself from the inside out' further support this classification. Additionally, tags such as 'meditation for anxiety,' 'meditation to calm the mind,' and 'meditation for peace of mind' align with a soothing and restorative theme.\n\nA secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm,' is assigned a score of 0.5. While this is a guided meditation and involves less physical movement, the continuous progression of positive affirmations and the guided nature of the session suggests elements of rhythm and flow. The description mentions being taken on a 'meditative journey,' which indicates a structured, rhythmic experience even in stillness.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the nature of meditation focused on relaxation rather than physical exertion or sports-specific skills. The absence of an outdoor context eliminates 'Outdoor & Adventure.'"
