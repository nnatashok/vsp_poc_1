  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is strongly represented in this video due to terms like 'anxiety-free', 'calm', and 'relaxation', seen in both the title and description, as well as tags like 'anxietyrelief', 'stressfree', 'peacefulmorning', and comments praising the calming nature of the content. The channel's focus on mindfulness and relaxation supports this classification, leading to a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant, with 0.65 score, indicated by the rhythmic element of the music, the reference to continuous breathwork patterns, and the emphasis on integrating the mind-body connection. The use of terms such as 'rhythmic music', and 'mindfulness', alongside the meditation-inspired tags, aligns with this spirit.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the absence of fast-paced or athletic indicators, and the content's focus on gentler, relaxing techniques rather than intense exercise."
