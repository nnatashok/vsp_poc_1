  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit for this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative,' earning a high score of 0.9. This classification is strongly supported by the video's focus on easing menstrual cramps, reducing bloating, and being a low-impact regimen suitable during menstruation, as highlighted by the tags 'ease menstrual cramp' and 'reduce bloating.' These keywords suggest a gentle, restorative approach intended for users to feel better during their period. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is the secondary spirit with a score of 0.6. The tags 'workout and stretch' and '5 minute stretch' indicate a continuous movement focus, and user comments about feeling re-energized and the ability to ease into the exercises during their period suggest a rhythmic, steady flow aiding mind-body connection. \n\nOther potential spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the emphasis on low intensity and restfulness, rather than high-impact or athletic training. The confidence level of 0.85 reflects strong indicators for a soothing approach, although less definitive evidence was available for the flow component."
