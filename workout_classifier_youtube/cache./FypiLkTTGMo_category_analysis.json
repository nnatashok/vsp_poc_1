  "categoriesExplanation": "The video 'Calm - Ease | Guided Meditation by Thich Nhat Hanh' is predominantly categorized under 'Meditation' with high confidence (0.9) due to explicit keywords in the title, description, and tags such as 'guided meditation', 'Thich Nhat Hanh meditation', 'mindfulness meditation', and 'meditation for sleep'. These indicate that the primary purpose of the video is to lead viewers through a meditative practice, aligning well with the definition of meditation as a mental practice focused on mindfulness and awareness. \n\nThe secondary category is 'Breathing exercises' with moderate confidence (0.5), as the inclusion of 'breathing meditation' as a tag suggests that controlled breathing techniques might be an element of this guided meditation. However, since the primary focus appears more on the overall meditative process rather than strictly on breathing techniques, the score reflects a moderate level of certainty. Other categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Mat' were excluded due to the lack of physical posture-focus indicated in the metadata."
