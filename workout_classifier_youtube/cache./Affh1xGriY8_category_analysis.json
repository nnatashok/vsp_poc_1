  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary focus of the video, as indicated by the title and description, is on meditation for inner peace, supported by phrases such as 'Meditation for Inner Peace', 'Relaxing Music for Meditation', and repeated references to meditation music throughout the description and tags. The tags include specific meditation-related phrases like 'buddha meditation' and 'vipassana meditation'. These elements strongly support the 'Meditation' category with a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'Yoga' category is also relevant, though to a lesser extent, due to the reference in the title to 'Relaxing Music for Meditation, Yoga, Studying'. The channel description and tags, such as 'music of yoga', further suggest yoga could be a complementary use of this video. However, since meditation is the more emphasized purpose, the score for 'Yoga' is lower at 0.4.\n\nOther categories, like 'Breathing exercises', were considered but excluded due to the lack of specific evidence supporting focused breathing practices in the video metadata."
