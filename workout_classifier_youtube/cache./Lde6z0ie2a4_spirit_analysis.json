  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is classified under 'High-Energy & Intense' with a high score of 0.9 due to numerous explicit indicators of intensity and energy. The title mentions 'Intense' and 'HIIT WORKOUT', which stands for High-Intensity Interval Training, inherently a high-energy form of exercise. Within the description, terms such as 'full body burn', 'INTENSE', and a reference to Les Mills Grits, which are known for their high-intensity nature, further cement this classification. Comments like 'hard work' and users mentioning being pushed to their limits support this spirit, indicating a vigorous workout.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also relevant with a score of 0.6. This is due to the use of a recognized workout methodology (HIIT, specifically Les Mills Grits) implying structure and discipline in following a pre-designed session format. This workout's use of interval principles suggests a structured approach through methodical timing of exercise and rest. No significant indicators of other spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm', 'Soothing & Restorative', 'Sport & Agility', or 'Outdoor & Adventure' are present, leading to their exclusion."
