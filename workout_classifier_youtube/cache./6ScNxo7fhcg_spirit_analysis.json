  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as High-Energy & Intense due to the use of 'Tabata' and 'HIIT' in the title and description, indicating a fast-paced, intense workout. The structure of 12 sprints with high effort (20s/10s) explicitly supports this classification, earning a score of 0.9.\n\nFlow & Rhythm is another present aspect due to the inclusion of rhythm-based spinning and tags like 'rhythm spin' and 'rhythm cycling', implying a music-driven and continuous movement, giving it a score of 0.6.\n\nAdditionally, the workout is also Structured & Disciplined, as it follows a specific protocol of warm-up, set intervals (Tabata), and cool-down, showing a well-organized plan. The description mentioning an 8-week spin program for beginners to build endurance suggests a structured progression, awarding it a score of 0.7.\n\nThe video does not relate to Soothing & Restorative or Outdoor & Adventure due to the intense and indoor nature, nor does it focus on Sport & Agility, as it lacks sports-specific techniques."
