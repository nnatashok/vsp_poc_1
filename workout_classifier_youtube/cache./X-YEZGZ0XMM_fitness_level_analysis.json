  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises included in this workout, such as decline push-ups, dips, side plank lifts, and various advanced push-up variations like diver and diamond push-ups, require significant coordination, strength, and body awareness. These are more complex than basic exercises, involving multiple muscle groups and requiring careful attention to form, especially with exercises like side planks and uneven push-ups. The requirement to perform exercises like wide push-ups, cobra push-ups, and diver push-ups indicates a higher technique difficulty, aligning with an advanced classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's structure with 45-second exercise intervals, minimal rest (30 seconds between supersets), and exercises performed in a superset format significantly increases difficulty. This effort is compounded by a lengthy duration of 43:30 minutes. Such a format, focusing on upper body and core strength without rest, raises the intensity level considerably, making it challenging for those new to exercise as indicated by the terms 'demanding bodyweight workout' and 'very challenging' in the description. The exercises themselves are bodyweight-based, reducing equipment reliance but not the intensity due to the continuous work of large muscle groups.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the advanced technique required for exercises like side planks, uneven push-ups, and decline movements, combined with the challenging intensity due to long workout duration, the workout is not suitable for beginners. It reasonably fits individuals at an intermediate fitness level who have some experience, due to the high complexity and demand of the exercises. Advanced users will find it appropriate due to the intensity and focus on varied, complex movements, while those who are elite may still find it beneficial as a rigorous bodyweight workout, which could complement their highly advanced training regimens."
