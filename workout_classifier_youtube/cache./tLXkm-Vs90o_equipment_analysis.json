  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Morning Breathwork Practice' suggests a focus on breathwork, which is typically performed without the need for any physical equipment. The tags, such as 'morning breathwork practice' and 'breathwork for productivity,' emphasize breathing and mental focus rather than physical exercise equipment. The description also refers to connecting with your breath and starting the day with a calm mind, without mentioning any physical equipment. Breathwork is generally a practice that can be done standing, sitting, or lying down, but none of these positions necessarily require a mat or similar equipment unless explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, with a primary focus on breathing techniques that don't require equipment."
