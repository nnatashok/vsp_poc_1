  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Yoga'. This is substantiated by the title '20 min Yoga for Flexibility - Sweet Release Feel Good Flow' and numerous mentions of 'yoga' in both the description and tags, such as 'vinyasa', 'yoga for flexibility', and 'full body yoga'. The channel, 'Yoga with Kassandra', further supports the focus on yoga as the central theme. The high score (0.9) reflects the strong and consistent identification of yoga throughout the metadata.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Stretching', with a score of 0.7, as the video emphasizes flexibility and includes tags and phrases like 'dynamic stretching', 'hamstring stretch', 'deep stretch', 'full body stretch', and 'quad stretches'. The description highlights that this yoga session focuses on improving mobility through stretching different muscle groups, such as hips, hamstrings, and shoulders.\n\nOther categories, such as 'Pilates' or 'Body weight', were not considered due to the explicit focus on yoga practices and techniques in both the video content and the channel's thematic focus."
