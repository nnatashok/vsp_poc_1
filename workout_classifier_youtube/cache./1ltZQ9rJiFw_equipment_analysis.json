  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title \"25 MIN EXPRESS PILATES WORKOUT || Moderate to Intermediate Pilates (No Equipment)\" clearly states that no equipment is required for this workout, suggesting a focus on bodyweight exercises. However, the description includes a significant piece of information mentioning a \"Mat from Liforme,\" with a link and a discount code. This implies that a mat is used during the workout, which is typical for Pilates exercises to provide comfort and support on the floor. Thus, while the workout is categorized as 'no equipment,' a mat is very likely used and beneficial for such exercises, leading to a confidence score of 0.75 for the necessity of a mat."
