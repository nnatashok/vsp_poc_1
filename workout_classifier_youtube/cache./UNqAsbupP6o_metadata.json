    "Fred,<br>I want to thank you for pushing me every time I get onto my bike to ride.   I was 200 lbs in July 2023, high blood pressure and some personal stuff that was weighing heavily on me.  I\u2019m a soccer player and have been playing since I was 5.  I haven\u2019t been playing because my knees are old \ud83d\ude02 and riding instead.  Currently I\u2019ve lost about 20 lbs of the 50 I need to lose and my blood pressure is back to normal.  <br>Thank you for being the sunshine and positivity I needed in my darkest days. Sincerely, a grateful rider \u2764",
    "Fred keeps you energized and motivated just when you wanna give up. He\u2019s got a great attitude and his music is upbeat and uplifting. \u2b50",
    "Fred\u2019s classes are the only classes I\u2019ll take! He\u2019s the absolute best! \ud83d\ude0a",
    "Best class I have found.  Good music, just enough talking but not too much and it\u2019s help hints not just babbling."
