  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video '15 Minute Guided Breathwork To Help Release Stuck Energy & Emotions' predominantly embodies 'The Zen Flow' vibe. Indicators include mentions of relaxation, clarity, mindfulness, and meditation, as cited in the description and tags ('calmmind', 'mindfulness', 'meditation', 'peacefulmorning'). This vibe is supported by the guided breathwork focus and the calming intent of the session, scoring it at 0.85.\n\nNext, 'The Deep Recharge' vibe is suitable as the workout promises a release of emotional blockages for relaxation and rejuvenation, which aligns with deep breath-centered techniques and implied nervous system reset ('emotion release', 'energy healing'). The safety precautions indicate controlled intensity, ensuring a grounding experience, giving it a score of 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, there is an aspect of 'The Endorphin Wave.' Although there is a strong relaxation component, user comments depict emotional and even somewhat euphoric experiences post-exercise ('energised', 'psychedelic'), aligning with the feel-good movement of a steady emotional climb, albeit moderately matching at a score of 0.45 due to less explicit suitability.\n\nThere is little ambiguity in its relaxing and restorative aims, with less emphasis on physical exertion or competitive elements, excluding more intense vibes."
