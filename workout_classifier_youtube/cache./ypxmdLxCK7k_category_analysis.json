  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Calisthenics', evidenced by the repeated use of terms like 'calisthenics', 'Calisthenics Workout', and phrases like 'learn calisthenics' in the tags and description. The channel 'THENX' focuses on calisthenics as indicated in their channel description and subscriber-focused content. Additionally, the description promotes using a 'calisthenics app'. The workout's focus on push-ups, a fundamental calisthenic movement, supports this categorization. \n\nThe secondary category is 'Body weight' with a high confidence score. This is because the workout involves body weight exercises exclusively, specifically push-ups as noted in the title, comments, and description. The body weight aspect is a major element of the workout but not the primary focus compared to the wider calisthenics theme, justifying a slightly lower score.\n\nOther potential categories such as 'Weight workout' were excluded due to the lack of any external weight or resistance equipment described in the metadata, despite mentions of a 'weight vest' in promotional material, as this is not part of the described workout routine."
