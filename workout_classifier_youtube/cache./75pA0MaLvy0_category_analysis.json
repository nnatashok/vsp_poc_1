  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Stretching' due to the explicit focus on stretching exercises mentioned in the title, description, and tags, such as \"Full Body Stretching Exercises\" and \"stretching for beginners\". The consistency of the terms used throughout the metadata strongly indicates this is a stretching routine, justifying a high score of 0.9 for this category. Additionally, the channel's focus on flexibility and gentle movement supports this classification.\n\nA secondary consideration could be 'Yoga' with a score of 0.3 due to the focus on controlled breathing and flexibility which are common elements in yoga practices. However, since the metadata does not explicitly mention yoga techniques or postures, and considering the video's emphasis on general stretching without specific yoga terminology, the confidence for categorizing it as Yoga remains moderate. The channel's content and viewer feedback about flexibility improvements further diminish the likelihood of it being a yoga-specific workout."
