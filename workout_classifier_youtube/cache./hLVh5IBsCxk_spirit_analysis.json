  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a very strong confidence level (0.9) because of explicit indicators throughout the video's metadata. The title, '20 MIN KILLER HIIT', emphasizes an intense and challenging session. The description underscores this with phrases like 'burn calories together', 'heart pumping', and the use of 'Killer HIIT'. The structure of the workout\u201430 seconds of exercise with 10 seconds rest\u2014focuses on maintaining high intensity, characteristic of HIIT.\n\nAdditionally, viewer comments highlight personal challenges associated with the workout, such as needing breaks, feeling overwhelmed, and subsequently achieving improved endurance, which also supports this categorization as intense.\n\nThe secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm' (0.3), is considered due to the music-driven pacing suggested by the mention of specific songs and the creation of a continuous workout experience, though these elements are not dominant compared to the intensity markers.\n\nOther spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the absence of methodological progression or a focus on relaxation."
