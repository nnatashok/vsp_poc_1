  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is classified as Intermediate due to its focus on Pilates, which typically involves slightly complex movements requiring good body control and awareness. The presence of the 'swan dive', mentioned in a top comment, suggests additional coordination and skill, aligning with a lower Advanced rating. However, there is no indication of highly technical or expert movements, which supports limiting the classification primarily to Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 38:42 minutes suggests a Moderate to Challenging effort level. Pilates workouts are generally not highly intense compared to other forms but can still be demanding, especially over longer periods without equipment to change resistance or intensity levels can vary by form adjustments. The description and comments emphasize a comprehensive workout, indicating a higher energy expenditure for less fit users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.76,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily Intermediate due to the Technique and Effort levels. The length of the workout and the presence of some movements that are harder to master (swan dive) could pose a challenge for complete beginners, pushing some classification into the Advanced level. Pilates is generally unsuitable for beginners due to the need for control and body awareness, and the absence of equipment means users must manage intensity through skill and form adjustments."
