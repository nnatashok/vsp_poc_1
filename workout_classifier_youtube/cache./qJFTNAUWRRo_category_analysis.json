  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is clearly 'Meditation' with a score of 0.9. This is supported by the title, 'Guided Meditation,' the tags like 'guided meditation,' 'meditation,' '20 minute meditation,' as well as the detailed description which focuses on achieving peace, reassurance, and a deep restorative sleep. The channel's name, 'Great Meditation,' and its description, which highlights their focus on original guided meditations, further solidify this classification.\n\nThe 'Breathing exercises' category is considered with a lower score of 0.3 because guided meditations typically involve some form of breathing regulation and relaxation techniques, though the focus on breathing is not explicitly mentioned in the available metadata. The overall confidence for these categories is very high at 0.95, given the explicit and recurring mentions of meditation-related concepts. No other categories like 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' are applicable here as there is no indication of physical movement or poses involved in this video."
