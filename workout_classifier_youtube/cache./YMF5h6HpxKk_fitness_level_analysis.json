  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is rated primarily as 'Beginner', with some inclusion of 'Intermediate' and 'Advanced'. This is due to the guided meditation's universal accessibility and the potential benefits it offers at multiple levels of personal development, rather than physical fitness. The video length slightly decreases suitability for complete beginners who may have difficulty maintaining focus, thus a moderate inclusion of higher levels. Since meditation is beneficial across fitness levels, users at different stages of personal growth can partake."
