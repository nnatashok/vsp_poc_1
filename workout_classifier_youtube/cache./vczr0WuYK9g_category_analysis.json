  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is Calisthenics, which is strongly supported by both the title 'Calisthenics for Beginners' and the recurring emphasis on calisthenics movements throughout the metadata, including tags, comments, and time stamps. The video clearly aims to educate viewers on calisthenics techniques, which is why Calisthenics receives a high score of 0.9. Additionally, the video includes a significant focus on bodyweight exercises, as calisthenics typically involves bodyweight resistance. This is reinforced by the specific mention of 'pushing,' 'pulling,' 'core,' and 'leg movements' in the description, thereby justifying a score of 0.7 in the Body weight category. A minor presence of stretching, evident from the specific time stamp at 03:07 and supported by a top comment discussing wrist stretches and warmups, accounts for a lower score of 0.3 in the Stretching category. The overall classification confidence is high at 0.95 due to explicit indications from the title and description."
