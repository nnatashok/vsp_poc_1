  "title": "30 minute Full Body Strength Workout | Strength Training for Seniors and Beginners",
  "description": "This is a strength training workout created for seniors and beginners who want to start lifting weights for an at home workout.  Each of the exercises is explained for seated or standing exercises.  We are into week 9 & 10 but you could also start with this program if you know the basics of strength training.  Each exercise is explained to ensure you do the exercises properly with good form.  By lifting weights, you'll become stronger, leaner and more fit.  Ideally, as the repetitions get easier over time, start to use a heavier weight to always see improvements.  \n\nPlease subscribe and write a comment!  I'd love to hear from you!  Feedback is always welcome!\n\nWishing you improved health!\nJules\n\n#strengthtraining #beginnerworkout #improvedhealth\n\nDisclaimer:  You should always consult your physician before starting any 'Improved Health' fitness program or any other fitness program.

    "I\u2019ve recently discovered your channel\u2026EXCELLENT! I\u2019m 68, and last year, I not only lost 110 pounds, but with a change in diet, my symptoms for bipolar and Parkinson\u2019s went away, and I no longer take 11 medications, some I\u2019d been on for 33 years, I had to use a wheelchair, then I \u201cgraduated\u201d to a walker, then a cane, no I don\u2019t need any of them. I wished I\u2019d found your channel when I first started\u2026the channels I found weren\u2019t near as thorough or professional as yours. I\u2019ve tried some other channels for \u201cover 50\u2019s\u201d and one I really like her routines, but she talks CONSTANTLY which really distracts me, and another channel is way too easy. Yours hits the perfect \u201csweet spot\u201d I really enjoy walking outside (I walk 3.5-5 miles a day) but I live in a part of the country where we can get cold (like -20 last February), don\u2019t get much snow but have ice storms. So I\u2019ll enjoy your walking workouts. Thanks a lot!",
    "I love that you are showing both options.  Also, your sound and visuals are always so well done.  It&#39;s obvious that you put a lot of care into your videos.",
    "This workout is the best.   I have doing it 3x per week and am getting stronger.   Thank you for no ads!!!",
    "I really enjoy dedicated strength with a stretch afterwards. I\u2019d like to see more for the intermediate level dedicated to full body strength. Regardless I\u2019ll be coming back to this workout weekly. Thank you,Jules.",
    "Jules, you have the best chair-exercise videos on YouTube! I retired July of 2020 at 70 years-old and both my knees need replaced. I have lost 50 lbs and must lose another 50 to get them!!! You have the sweetest spirit and I thank you so very much. You have given me such help and hope, Jules, and I will let you know how\u2019s it\u2019s going. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc9b"
