  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Breathing Exercises' with a score of 1.0, as the title and tags prominently feature terms like 'breathwork', 'pranayama', and 'breathing exercises'. These terms indicate a focused practice of controlled breathing techniques. The description further supports this as it mentions using the breath practice for a calm mind and energy. \n\n'Meditation' is also a significant category, with a score of 0.7. The title explicitly mentions 'Meditation Practice', and user comments highlight relaxation and mental relief, which are typical outcomes of meditation. \n\n'Yoga' is given a lower score of 0.4. Although the tags include 'yoga', and there's a mention of 'pranayama', a practice often associated with yoga, the video seems to focus more on breathing and meditation rather than traditional yoga postures. This is further supported by user comments prioritizing breathwork and meditation over physical yoga practice."
