    "What is something you can let go of for today?",
    "This 7 year old practice is truly the gift that keeps on giving <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/m8MfY4jbFsWJhL0PyouA2Ak\"></a>",
    "For almost the last 10 years, since I was a child, I&#39;ve had severe anxiety. It&#39;s uncommon for me to get more than a few hours sleep a night, I have chronic pain from holding so much tension, and I have constant intrusive thoughts, and many panic attacks. I often have to take sedatives to even begin to relax my body. I thought I&#39;d try this tonight and I cried mid way through because I could feel the tension leaving my body. I didn&#39;t think once about any of my worries, my fears, my &#39;failures&#39; during the day. It is bliss to have even 20 minutes without them. This was perfect. Thank you.",
    "While massaging my feet, I started thinking of where my feet had taken me the last 29 years. I couldn\u2019t help but cry. It was such an intimate moment with myself. Thank you",
    "Just wanted to pop on here and say: I&#39;ve been using this video nightly for about a year now, and it has allowed me to start falling asleep at a normal bedtime and stop having PTSD nightmares. My mental health is improving, and I no longer have as much pain and tension in my shoulders and back. You are really transforming my life with this simple 20-minute practice. Thank you SO much for sharing!"
