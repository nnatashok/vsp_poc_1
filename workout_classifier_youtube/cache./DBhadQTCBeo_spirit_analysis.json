  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata for this workout video clearly indicates that it embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The title 'Sleep Meditation Guided 20 Minute' and tags such as 'meditation sleep' and 'sleep guided meditation' suggest a focus on relaxation and sleep induction rather than physical intensity or technical training. The description further confirms this by mentioning the purpose of inducing a 'deeply relaxing state' and highlighting body scans to relieve tension. Viewer comments such as 'calm me down' and 'helps me thank you so much' reflect the restorative impact on users. Considering these aspects, there's very high confidence in categorizing this video as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 1.0, as it perfectly aligns with the spirit's emphasis on relaxation and recovery."
