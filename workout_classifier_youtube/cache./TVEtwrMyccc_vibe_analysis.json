  "vibesExplanation": "The video primarily fits 'The Warrior Workout' vibe due to its emphasis on a full-body calisthenics routine designed to build strength and muscle ('Gain muscle, increase strength'). Although it's a beginner-friendly workout, the focus on no-equipment, bodyweight exercises aligns with the primal, sweat-inducing nature of this vibe, which is evidenced by user comments like 'I\u2019ve been wanting to become stronger' and 'my 56 yr old body feels so much better.' The score of 0.7 reflects this strong alignment, though it slightly steps back from the 'unleashing your inner beast' intensity often associated with this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe is also present due to the inclusion of 'difficulty variations' and 'technique tips throughout,' emphasizing a focus on skill and technical execution, with a score of 0.6. This reflects the structured, instructional nature of the vibe, particularly highlighted by comments appreciating precise instructions ('you just give precise and useful instructions, which is rare').\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Progression Quest' were considered but ultimately not prioritized due to the primary focus on strength-building and technique over long-term endurance or systematic progression."
