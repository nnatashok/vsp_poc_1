    "My wife listens to your guided meditations all the time. Recently she was diagnosed  with colon cancer. She\u2019s in stage 4. She\u2019s not doing well at all. She asks me to play your guided meditations for her. I found this one. She doesn\u2019t always have the strength to do the inhaling and exhaling, but her facial expression looks much more comfortable and calm after she listens to you. Even her heart rate is lower in a good way. Thank you Jason for your work.",
    "Every one who listen this heal and gain good health \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\ud83d\udcaa",
    "May all those suffering from physical, mental, or emotional disease be flooded with God&#39;s infinite healing and comfort and protection. Amen."
