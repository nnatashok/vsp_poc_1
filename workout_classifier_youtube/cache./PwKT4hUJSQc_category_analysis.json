  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is strongly classified as a 'Treadmill' category workout with very high confidence due to numerous explicit references in the title, tags, and description. The title \"Heart Health Month Series: Treadmill Walk - Easy to Follow Along | 30 Minutes\" clearly indicates a treadmill-specific workout. Similarly, tags such as 'Treadmill Walk', 'treadmill workout', 'treadmill walking workout', and 'treadmill workout for beginners' further support this classification. Additionally, the description mentions using a treadmill (Product Used: SF-T7917) and provides detailed workout instructions tailored for a treadmill environment, including variations in speed and incline.\n\nSimultaneously, there is a secondary emphasis on 'Walking', as the workout involves a walking motion of varied intensity, supported by tags like 'walk at home', 'treadmill walking workout', and comments from users describing their walking experiences on the treadmill. However, because the treadmill context is dominant, the 'Walking' category is less central, though still relevant, justifying a slightly lower score."
