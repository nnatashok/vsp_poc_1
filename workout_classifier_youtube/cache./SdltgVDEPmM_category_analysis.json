  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Stretching' with a score of 1.0. This is strongly supported by the title, which explicitly mentions '15 MIN STRETCH FOR SPLITS,' and repetition of terms like 'stretch,' 'flexibility,' and 'splits' in the tags and description. The description emphasizes a focus on hamstring and hip flexibility, confirming 'Stretching' as the central element of the routine. The top comments reinforce this, with users discussing their progress in flexibility and achieving splits through consistent stretching practice. \n\nAdditionally, 'Yoga' is another relevant category with a score of 0.5. Although not explicitly a yoga routine, the tags and description feature the word 'yoga' alongside stretching, suggesting some influence or overlap with yoga practices, which often include stretching and flexibility components. The presence of '15 min yoga' and 'madfit yoga' in the tags hints at this connection, but since the routine is more focused on stretching specifically for splits, 'Yoga' plays a secondary role. This analysis supports a high confidence level of 0.9 due to explicit metadata indicators and user engagement that align with these categories."
