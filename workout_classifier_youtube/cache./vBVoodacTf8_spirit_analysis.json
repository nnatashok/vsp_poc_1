  "spiritsExplanation": "The dominant workout spirit for this video is \"High-Energy & Intense\" with a very high confidence score of 0.95. This classification is due to multiple strong indicators: the workout is labeled an 'Insane 20 Minute Treadmill Workout' and 'HIIT Workout', emphasizing intensity ('Insane', 'HIIT', 'sprint training'). The description also mentions 'going as hard as you can' and promotes 'fat burning in the shortest time possible', consistent with high energy expenditure. \n\n\"Structured & Disciplined\" is also applicable, with a score of 0.7. The workout follows a precise interval methodology ('8 rounds of 30 seconds hard, 90 seconds low intensity'), a structured sequence including a '5 minute warm-up' and '3 minute cool-down', and recommendations for frequency ('2-3 times a week'). This spirit reflects the workout's adherence to methodical, disciplined HIIT protocol.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to lack of relevant indicators: 'Flow & Rhythm' lacks evidence of continuous, music-driven movement, 'Soothing & Restorative' contradicts the high intensity focus, 'Sport & Agility' is not explicitly performance-oriented beyond general fitness, and 'Outdoor & Adventure' is irrelevant to treadmill-based training."
