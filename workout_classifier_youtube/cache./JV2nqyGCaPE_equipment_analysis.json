  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title 'Quick Sprint Session! | 10 Minute Indoor Cycling Workout' explicitly mentions 'Indoor Cycling,' which strongly suggests the use of a stationary exercise bike. The tags further reinforce this by including terms like 'spin,' 'spinning,' 'indoor cycling,' and 'turbo trainer,' all of which are commonly associated with stationary cycling workouts. The description refers to a quick 'progressive sprint session,' which aligns with high-intensity interval training on a stationary bike. Additionally, the channel focus on 'free bike workout classes' and 'HIIT workouts on the bike' consolidates the requirement for an exercise bike. Given that indoor cycling is central to the workout, there is very high confidence (1.0) that an exercise bike is required."
