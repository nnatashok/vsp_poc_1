The description highlights stress relief and relaxation using guided breathing techniques without any mention of physical exercises that typically require equipment. Furthermore, the tags emphasize mindfulness, meditation, and stress relief, all of which are usually associated with bodyweight activities. Comments from users also reflect experiences with emotional and psychological benefits without referencing any physical equipment. As such, no specific equipment is necessary for this type of workout, which confirms it is effectively bodyweight only."
