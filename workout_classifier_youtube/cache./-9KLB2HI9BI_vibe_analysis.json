  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this video is 'The Zen Flow', with a high confidence score of 0.85. This selection is supported by explicit mentions in the title and description that emphasize 'guided meditation', 'positivity', and 'gratitude'. The focus on breath, intention, and unhurried pacing aligns with the 'Zen Flow' characteristics.\n\nFurthermore, the video length of around 10 minutes and themes of positivity and joy suggest a calming, grounding exercise, consistent with this vibe.\n\n'The Deep Recharge' is also relevant, scoring 0.65. The content promotes resetting emotional states by raising 'vibration', akin to nervous system relaxation and low-stress rejuvenation activities.\n\nThe channel's focus on self-development and mindfulness reinforces these vibes. Other vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' are less applicable as they suggest repetitive endurance, which is not supported by the mentioned guided, gentle nature of the meditation."
