  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is classified primarily as 'The Zen Flow' due to the emphasis on grounding and breath-centered movement, evident from terms like 'balance', 'flexibility', 'strength', and 'vinyasa yoga flow'. The track includes moves aimed at opening the hips and shoulders which aligns with creating a grounding and calming experience. This is supported by user comments expressing feelings of peace and connection, and the channel's focus on yoga and Pilates.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Reboot Workout' is a fit with a moderate score due to the full-body stretch and refresh elements implied by tags like 'feel good yoga' and 'yoga to feel your best', as well as the emphasis on overall wellbeing from the description and comments.\n\nLastly, 'The Groove Session' has a mild match. The creator's background as a dancer and the description mentioning feeling 'good on the inside out' suggest an expressive, enjoyable flow akin to dancing, but this vibe is less pronounced due to the session's structured nature focused more on balance and flexibility."
