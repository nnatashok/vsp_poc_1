  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled \"Beginners Indoor Cycle Workout | Home Workout | Ideal World,\" and the description explicitly mentions that the workout is guided using an indoor cycle or exercise bike. It advises viewers to increase the resistance on their indoor bike if they find the workout too easy. The tags repeatedly emphasize terms like \"indoor cycling workout,\" \"beginners spin workout,\" and \"bike workout,\" which all point to the use of an exercise bike. Additionally, comments from viewers frequently mention their use of an exercise bike or spin bike, such as one user stating they bought a pro-form 500 spx and another thanking the trainer for the workout they've done on their newly purchased spin bike. These elements collectively contribute to a very high confidence rating of 1.0 for the requirement of an exercise bike for this workout."
