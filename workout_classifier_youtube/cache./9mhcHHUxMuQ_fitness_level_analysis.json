  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique required for this elliptical HIIT workout is relatively simple due to the nature of using an elliptical machine, which involves repetitive stepping motions. There are no complex movement patterns beyond adjusting resistance levels and speed. The description notes a variety of intervals, but these generally involve jogging, sprinting, and running, which are straightforward on an elliptical. The tags also suggest beginner accessibility (\u2018elliptical workout for beginners\u2019), supporting a classification at the Beginner level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is mainly determined by the interval nature and varying resistance levels of the workout. The session lasts 30 minutes and involves multiple intervals with increased resistance, which elevate physical demands. Tags and descriptions label it as 'Heart Pumping', indicating moderate to high cardiovascular demands. The description specifies increasing resistance up to level 10, suggesting a significant, yet adaptable, challenge. The duration and varying intensities push this towards a 'Moderate' to 'Challenging' effort, especially for deconditioned users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the described technique and effort difficulties, this workout is most suitable for users with a fitness level at the Intermediate level, with some capacity for Advanced users due to interval training\u2019s intensity increase through higher resistance settings. Beginners could attempt adaptations by keeping lower resistance settings, but the full execution at prescribed intensities could be demanding, hence the beginner scoring is lower. The channel and user comments highlight a motivational aspect and accessibility, mentioning it's 'perfect for the first 30 min of your workout' and suitable for 'beginners', indicating a supportive context for a range of fitness levels. The interval nature offers scalability, contributing to the inclusion of multiple fitness levels."
