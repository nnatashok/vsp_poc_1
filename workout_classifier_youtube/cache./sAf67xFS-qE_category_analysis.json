  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under 'Stretching' due to its focus on a 'Morning Stretch' and 'Full Body Flexibility Routine,' as stated explicitly in the title and tags ('morning stretch', 'full body stretch', 'daily stretch', 'flexibility'). The description further supports this by describing the routine as a 5-minute morning stretch. The comments describe feelings of increased flexibility and improved start to the day, commonly associated with stretching routines. Given the channel is hosted by a certified yoga teacher and the description mentions 'Yoga inspired,' the workout also fits under 'Yoga' (score 0.7), recognizing elements like mindfulness and manageable routines typical in yoga practices. The primary focus on stretching, however, grants it a higher score. Other categories are excluded as there is no indication of more intense workouts, equipment use, or activities related to strength training or cardio."
