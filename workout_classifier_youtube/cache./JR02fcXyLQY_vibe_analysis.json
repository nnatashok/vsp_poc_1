  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of this workout video is \"The Zen Flow\" with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is due to the video's focus on grounding, intentional breath-centered meditation aimed at helping viewers find peace and surrender to the flow of life's experiences. The title and description emphasize surrender, finding peace, and just being, making it an excellent match for \"The Zen Flow.\" \n\nAdditionally, there is a strong element of \"The Deep Recharge\" with a score of 0.7. The video is described as a \"guided meditation for stress & anxiety,\" suggesting a focus on nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement, which aligns well with the \"Deep Recharge\" vibe. \n\nLastly, \"The Meditative Grind\" received a score of 0.5 due to the repetitive and calming nature of guided meditation practices that allow users to \"just sit in stillness,\" but since the focus is more on relaxation than endurance, it is a moderate match. \n\nOther vibes such as \"The Comfort Moves\" or \"The Sleep Prep\" were considered but not selected due to the lack of specific elements like chair support or preparation for sleep."
