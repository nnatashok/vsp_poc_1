  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated as 'Beginner' due to the nature of the video being a guided meditation. The practice focuses on breath awareness and concentration, which are basic meditation techniques requiring minimal physical or technical skill. The channel explicitly targets beginners and experienced meditators alike, indicating that the technique is accessible to users without prior experience.",

  ],
  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 1.0,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is assessed as 'Light,' primarily because meditation is inherently low in physical exertion and energy expenditure. The video is only 10 minutes long and involves sitting quietly, focusing on breathing, and mental relaxation. This lack of physical intensity and short duration means it demands minimal physical effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is classified as 'Beginner' with strong alignment, given the simple technique and light effort required. However, meditation can be challenging mentally, so 'Intermediate' and 'Advanced' levels are included with lower scores to account for users who might find sustained focus difficult despite the lack of physical demand. The inclusive language on the channel's focus, accommodating both new and experienced meditators, supports a broader range of fitness levels. Yet, the physical demands remain suitable for beginners across all categories."
