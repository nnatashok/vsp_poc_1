  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video primarily features hill walking intervals on a treadmill. This is a straightforward movement requiring minimal coordination and technique, typical of a beginner level. The description emphasizes staying at the same speed with changes in incline, which doesn't introduce significant complexity. However, managing treadmill settings and maintaining balance on an incline may offer slight challenges befitting an intermediate rating, warranting a small inclusion at this level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 15-minute hill walk with interval inclines, suggesting a light effort overall. The comments indicate it is a 'quick workout' and suitable for beginners, reinforcing the low to moderate energy expenditure. The moderate level is included due to the cardiovascular demand from walking on an incline, which might be moderately challenging for very deconditioned individuals.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The primary fitness level required is beginner, as the workout is framed as 'beginner-friendly' in both the title and tags. However, the interval nature of the workout and incline changes, though suggested for comfort, can pose a slight challenge for absolute beginners. Intermediate is included to a lesser extent, accounting for those who might struggle with varying treadmill inclines. Given the channel's encouragement to adjust to personal comfort levels, the workout is approachable for those beyond new beginners as well."
