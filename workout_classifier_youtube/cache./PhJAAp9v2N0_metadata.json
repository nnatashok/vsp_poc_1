    "I have never worked out my whole life or have been a part of sports in school. I am 23 and overweight and couldn&#39;t carry my own body weight recently feeling so weak as I couldn&#39;t dance or do anything heavy. Most of the workouts that I found on YouTube weren&#39;t really helpful as it was difficult for someone like me and I gave up quickly.  I found this channel a month and a half ago and started with her 20 min yoga and 30 min Stretch routine and found it extremely helpful. I could now do things that I couldn&#39;t do these past years. I feel that her videos helps people with different levels of strength and stamina. She is really the best out here! If you are new to this channel, the results are real!",
    "I have been doing this every morning for almost 3 months, the results are amazing. Highly recommended.",
    "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhJAAp9v2N0&amp;t=64\">1:04</a> <br><br>For anyone else doing this regularly and doesn&#39;t need the introduction every time ;\u00ac)",
    "Love how calm and chill you are overall, not just in this stretch video, but just in general.  It\u2019s so inviting and easy to follow along to...trainers that get in my face or are overly encouraging stress me out.  Your style is so refreshing and needed! Keep up the great work!"
