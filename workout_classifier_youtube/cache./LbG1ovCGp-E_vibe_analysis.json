  "vibesExplanation": "The workout's emphasis on a moderate, energizing morning Pilates routine fits the description of 'The Zen Flow' due to its grounding and breath-centered approach. The title and description suggest an intentional and calming session that promotes mindfulness, which is indicated by phrases like 'energising your body' and 'morning Pilates class.' This aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe, thus earning it a strong score.\n\nAdditionally, the description and tags reference a focus on expressive movement rather than intense physical exertion, characteristic of 'The Groove Session,' which involves fluid and fun exercises in the moment. The comments further emphasize a supportive and feel-good environment that contributes to this vibe, leading to a moderate score for 'The Groove Session.'\n\nWhile elements of Pilates might suggest 'The Masterclass Workout' due to skill-building, the overall emotional tone and goals of the workout lean more towards expression and mindfulness, leaving little focus on precision or specific strength gains, thus excluding that vibe."
