  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is primarily designed as a morning yoga stretch routine with emphasis on simple, accessible movements suitable for beginners. The description explicitly mentions it's perfect for 'beginners and experienced practitioners alike,' highlighting its simplicity. Comments often refer to the routine as gentle and relaxing, suitable for beginning a day. The instructor's mention of starting the day with this session indicates movements likely involve basic stretches and poses, typical of a beginner level routine. However, the slight consideration for intermediate level comes from the possibility that some stretches may include poses that are beneficial to more experienced practitioners as well, such as vinyasa elements mentioned in comments.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This 10-minute routine focuses on gentle stretching, with benefits like energy boost and reduction in morning stiffness stated in the description. The short duration and emphasis on stretching suggest it requires light effort, suitable for users in poor physical condition. Comments highlight the relaxing nature of the routine, suggesting minimal energy expenditure. A small score for moderate effort is appropriate given the potential for slightly more engaging poses that might mildly challenge deconditioned users, and references to 'energy boost' might imply modest physical engagement.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The routine's target audience appears to be primarily beginners, as detailed in the description, with a gentle, stress-relieving, and simple structure suitable for users new to exercise. The video's purpose of energizing mornings gently aligns strongly with beginner needs. A minor intermediate suggestion applies due to the video's adaptability for more experienced practitioners who might perform variations or use it as a recovery session, as seen in comments from longer-term practitioners who enjoy more intricate yoga flows. Consistent practice could slightly elevate its challenge for beginners seeking to transition to intermediate complexity over time."
