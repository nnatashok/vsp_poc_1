    "I&#39;m so heavy footed just walking on a treadmill, I&#39;m afraid to try running.",
    "I&#39;ve watched two videos on the same subject before this one, and none of them mentioned the safety string.<br>I was really happy when you mentioned it, because this is, after all, a beginners tutorial and safety should be a priority on automated machines (also most beginners are a bit afraid from falling, so safety should help them get confortable)<br>GG and continue the great videos",
    "thank you the RUN experience. I just had my half marathon. thank you all guys!\ud83d\ude1a you are all awesome",
    "Thanks for the advice. I&#39;m watching this as I get ready to go to the gym. I live in Chicago where it can get very cold or snowy or rainy. I&#39;ve used a treadmill many times and in the past I would build up my speed to start. In the last year or so, I&#39;ve been entering the speed I think I should start at. Thanks for the reminder that it&#39;s okay to build up and just jump in at 5 mph."
