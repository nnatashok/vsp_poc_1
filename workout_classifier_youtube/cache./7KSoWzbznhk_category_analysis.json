  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is 'Stretching' with a score of 1.0, as the video is explicitly described as a full body stretch routine. The title and tags repeatedly mention stretching, and the description emphasizes flexibility and cool down, supporting its function as a stretching-focused workout. The strong emphasis on being a 'total body stretch' further solidifies this classification. \n\nThe 'Mat' category is assigned a score of 0.6 due to the nature of the exercises likely being performed on an exercise mat, as indicated by the focus on 'at home workouts' and 'slow workout' tags, although the specific term 'mat' is not directly mentioned. This category is typical for routines performed without other significant equipment, although the metadata does not detail any auxiliary exercises to reduce the score from a higher confidence level.\n\nThe channel's focus on at-home real-time workouts supports these categories, while comments confirm the effectiveness of the routine in improving flexibility, fitting well with a stretching and mat-based workout."
