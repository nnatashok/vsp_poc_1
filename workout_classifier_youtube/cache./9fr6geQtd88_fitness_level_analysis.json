  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the very basic technique and low effort difficulty, primarily focusing on mental relaxation, the required fitness level is predominantly 'Beginner.' However, meditation can benefit individuals at all fitness levels. Including 'Intermediate' acknowledges that individuals moderately engaged with personal development may also find value, particularly due to the introspective aspects noted in comments."
