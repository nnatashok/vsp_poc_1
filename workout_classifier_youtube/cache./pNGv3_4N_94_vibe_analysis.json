  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is designed specifically for prenatal fitness, which suggests a focus on safety, comfort, and adaptability for varying energy levels during pregnancy. The term 'beginner-friendly' in the title and the use of moderate equipment like dumbbells imply that the exercises are gentle yet effective, highlighting 'The Comfort Moves' vibe with a strong score of 0.9. This is further supported by user comments expressing appreciation for the workout's calming nature and suitability for different pregnancy stages. \n\nMoreover, the workout description mentions basic equipment (a mat and dumbbells), indicating a foundational strengthening component, aligning with 'The Foundation Builder' vibe to some extent, scoring 0.6. The inclusion of core work and mention of 'core work with weights overhead' also supports the focus on maintaining essential strength and stability, reinforcing this vibe.\n\nOther potential vibes, such as 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Reboot Workout,' were considered but excluded due to a lack of direct indicators of a meditative or recovery-focused approach in the metadata."
