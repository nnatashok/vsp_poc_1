  "vibesExplanation": "The video '15 Most Effective Bodyweight Leg Exercises' from the 'Strength Side' channel primarily embodies 'The Progression Quest' vibe, scoring 0.7. This is supported by the focus on bodyweight progression exercises such as the air squat, pistol squats, and bulgarian split squats, aiming at long-term strength development and mobility gains. The use of phrases like 'build strong power legs' and 'get the most out of your bodyweight training' signal incremental physical improvements, characteristic of the Progression Quest vibe.\n\n'Progression Quest' is supported by the description of transforming aesthetics with functional exercises, suitable for sustained improvement over time. The comprehensive guide suggests a programmatic, structured approach to leg training that is intrinsic to this vibe.\n\nThe video also suggests 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe with a score of 0.6, indicated by the detailed showcase of specific, technique-driven exercises like the 'Pistol Squats' and 'Nordic Curls'. This highlights a focus on mastering form and technique.\n\nFinally, 'The Foundation Builder' vibe (scoring 0.3) is modestly present as the workout covers foundational exercises such as air squats and lunges that strengthen basic movement patterns and lower body integrity, but it is not the primary focus. The intent to perfect the basics aligns with some elements of this classification, though it is less emphasized compared to the other vibes."
