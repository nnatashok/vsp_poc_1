    "Wife, mother, housewife, certainly busy with Christmas preparations, but you dear Caroline, do not miss the opportunity to make us happy with new videos every day. \ud83d\ude4cI write deliberately happy because we could be more than  lucky that you have decided to put such great, unique, creative, demanding, varied exercises online.\r\u2764\ud83d\udcaf<br>You can easily manage the missing 5000 subscribers up to 450,000\r\ud83d\udd90<br>\r<br>Today&#39;s video was great, I had a lot of fun. Ultimately, you could decide which dumballs to use. Trisets are a great idea, more of them please.\r<br>\r<br>I would like to positively mention that the tips / hints can now be seen much better.\r\ud83d\udc4d<br>\r<br>Wish you a nice evening",

Thank you for all your AMAZING videos! so grateful to have found your channel. YOU ROCK xx"
