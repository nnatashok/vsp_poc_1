  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category is 'Pilates' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is evident from the video's title and content explicitly referring to a 'full body hourglass pilates workout' and the channel being run by a 'certified Pilates instructor'. Furthermore, the top comments emphasize the importance of breathing, mindful movement, and references to pilates practice, which are key elements of Pilates. Additionally, there is a notable presence of 'Stretching', with a score of 0.65, based on the comments about achieving proper form, feeling the burn, and stretching mentioned by viewers. The workout is described as beginner-friendly with added difficulty via ankle weights, which aligns well with typical Pilates modifications. There is no indication of other specific workout types such as weightlifting or HIIT, which supports the exclusion of those categories."
