  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Lower Body Stretch - Muscle Recovery and Stress Relief' from the MrandMrsMuscle channel strongly embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The title explicitly mentions 'Muscle Recovery and Stress Relief,' which are key components of a soothing and restorative workout. The presence of tags like 'muscle recovery,' 'stretch,' 'wellness,' and 'stretching exercises' further reinforces this spirit. The description emphasizes low impact modifications and stretching, aligning with recovery-focused sessions. User comments praising the relaxation and background music solidify this interpretation, illustrating a serene atmosphere.\n\nAdditionally, there is a noticeable presence of 'Flow & Rhythm,' evidenced by comments about smooth transitions and music that encourages movement ('swinging hips throughout'). Tags such as 'yoga' and 'stretching music' also suggest a rhythmic and flowing approach, though not as strongly as the primary focus on restoration. This spirit is given a moderate score of 0.65 due to its implicit but consistent presence."
