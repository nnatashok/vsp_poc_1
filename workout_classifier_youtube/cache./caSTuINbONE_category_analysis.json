  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'Pilates' with a high score of 0.9. This is strongly supported by the video's title, which explicitly mentions 'pilates workout', and the channel description, which refers to the creator as a 'certified Pilates instructor'. The focus on an 'hourglass' figure and the fact that it's 'beginner friendly' align with common goals of Pilates exercise routines which emphasize toning and body alignment. The category 'Body weight' also applies with a score of 0.6 since Pilates typically involves exercises without added weights, focusing on body resistance. Comments referring to core and upper body improvements without mentioning external weights further support this categorization. 'Body weight' is a secondary category reflecting the nature of the exercises likely involved. The channel's consistent presentation of similar content and the video's significant engagement reinforce the classification confidence."
