  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as \"The Reboot Workout\" due to its focus on stretching, mobility, and overall body refresher, indicated by phrases like \"Recover on your rest day,\" and \"feeling fresh and recharged.\" This is confirmed by the description's emphasis on recovery and the use of no equipment, making it a staple of a low-stress, total-body refresh. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong alignment with these key elements.\n\n\"The Zen Flow\" is another relevant vibe due to the slow, intentional, and breath-centered qualities of the workout suggested by words like \"take it slow for your body and mind.\" This slower pace and body-focused approach fit this vibe well, hence a score of 0.75 is applied.\n\nLastly, \"The Deep Recharge\" is considered due to the video's calming, restorative language and the evident appreciation from users for its relaxing feel, as seen in comments like \"I feel refreshed and my body is relieved.\" A 0.6 score reflects a moderate match as the workout has restorative elements but less emphasis on purely passive movements that fully characterize \"The Deep Recharge.\" \n\n\"The Reboot Workout\" fits best due to the dominant theme of body recovery, and other vibes are rated lower due to their more specific criteria of mindfulness and passive relaxation."
