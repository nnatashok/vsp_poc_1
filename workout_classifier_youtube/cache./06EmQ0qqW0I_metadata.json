A stationary bike doesn't have magical 'belly fat burning' powers.\n\nI used the words \"Targets Belly Fat\" to motivate you to do this workout and YES,\n\nYou'll lose belly fat and weight all over your body. How fast you lose weight along with belly fat depends on how overweight you are. Basically, the bigger your stomach = the faster you'll lose belly fat.\n\nThe only time you can target belly fat is when you're down to your last 10-to-20 pounds. At that point, most of the fat you have left to lose is in your belly area.\n\nHere\u2019s more STATIONARY BIKE WORKOUTS to Lose Weight,\n\n10 Minute BEGINNER https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOIhG2GbZ3c \n30 Minute BEGINNER https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8cvg2i2r48 \n\n40 Minute INTERMEDIATE Level 1 \ud83d\udc48 0:00 YOU JUST DID THIS ONE\n30 Minute INTERMEDIATE Level 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_xW0patsk \n\n60 Minute ADVANCED https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY8oEc9WqK4 \n30 Minute EXTREME https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzXr0bhL7s0  \n\nRECUMBENT BIKE Workout for ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tlNyrdMfn4\n\nUse the Bike\u2019s MANUAL or QUICKSTART program. Pedal AS FAST AS POSSIBLE (without adjusting the tension) to BURN FAT as fast as possible. \n\nSORRY, the Gold's Gym 290 C Stationary Exercise Bike used by @AdrianBryant in the workout video is no longer available but...  Any stationary bike like https://amzn.to/3CB7hh1 is good for weight loss.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M1BabvgEHE to see the weight loss results people got from doing  @AdrianBryant    workouts\n\nAdrian\u2019s Elliptical Weight Loss Workouts https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5qWKDYV54nGTA04wnMmZ2VvhOQFGUrC-\n\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: The information provided by Adrian Bryant is of a general nature and is furnished only for educational/entertainment purposes only.
