  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves treadmill HIIT, which generally includes walking or running and can be performed with simple modification for beginners or at higher speeds for intermediates. The inclusion of resistance bands and dumbbells allows for some complexity but these exercises can be simplified depending on user capability. Therefore, the technique is mainly Beginner to Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort is moderate due to its duration of 32:54 minutes and the inclusion of both cardio and strength exercises, which increase energy expenditure. Although described as a 15-minute session, the total length indicates a more challenging routine. The high calorie burn mentioned in comments suggests a challenging intensity, but the capacity for modification maintains moderate to challenging alignment.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the workout targets multiple fitness levels by allowing movement modifications (e.g., speed on treadmill, resistance choice for exercises), it can accommodate Beginners through Advanced. The workout's length over 20 minutes diminishes Beginner accessibility slightly but includes adaptations to keep Intermediate and some Advanced users engaged. User comments also reflect frequent participation, suggesting moderate experience alignment."
