  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video features exercises that range from basic (pushup) to more complex movements such as the human pullover and handstand pushup. These exercises require moderate to high levels of coordination and body awareness. Based on these exercises, with a mix of simple and moderately complex techniques, the technique difficulty is rated between Intermediate and Advanced. The presence of calisthenic movements like handstand pushups indicates a need for stability and range of motion control, aligning with Intermediate to Advanced levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 9 minutes long, which is relatively short but involves exercises known for inducing muscle fatigue, such as chin-ups and handstand pushups. These exercises are demanding on specific muscle groups and likely require minimal rest due to the short duration. Therefore, the effort difficulty is rated between Moderate and Challenging. Duration and described exercise intensity suggest moderate energy expenditure with sections potentially requiring significant effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the technique and effort difficulty together, along with the video\u2019s short duration and variety of exercises, multiple fitness levels are included to accommodate user modifications and intensity preferences. The exercises are scalable as stated in the description, allowing Beginners to adjust the load, while Intermediate and Advanced users can engage more fully in the challenging exercises like handstand pushups and pullups. The focus on movable body positions and scalability allows for a wide range of fitness levels, making it suitable for those progressing from Beginner to Advanced."
