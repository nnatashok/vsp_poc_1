  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video strongly embodies the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit with a score of 0.9, as it features virtual running through the scenic landscapes of Mount Cook, New Zealand, inviting viewers to explore nature from home. The use of terms like 'virtual run,' 'virtual mountain trail run,' and 'scenery for treadmill' in the tags and description reinforces this spirit. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present, scoring 0.7, as the video's continuous virtual scenes with music suggest a rhythmic pace designed to maintain engagement and coordination during the treadmill session. Comments indicating the enjoyment of scenery and music support this inference. Additionally, there's a 'Soothing & Restorative' element with a score of 0.6, as the video provides a mental escape and relaxation, which is appreciated by viewers who use it for gentle exercise and relief. The comments emphasize the therapeutic aspects, such as happy reminiscences of different terrains and enjoyment of beautiful landscapes."
