  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video, titled \"30 MIN PILATES YOGA WORKOUT || Full Body Stretch & Strengthen,\" suggests a pilates and yoga fusion workout which typically involves exercises performed on the floor, where a mat is commonly used for comfort and support. The description explicitly mentions 'Mat from Liforme,' indicating that a mat is not only used but also promoted, which strongly suggests it is an essential piece of equipment for this workout. The tags and description reiterate the yoga and pilates context, aligning with mat usage. Therefore, the confidence score for the mat is set at 0.9, reflecting very high confidence that a mat is central to performing this workout effectively."
