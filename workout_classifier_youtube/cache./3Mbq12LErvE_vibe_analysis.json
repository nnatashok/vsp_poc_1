  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is predominantly characterized by 'The Zen Flow' vibe due to its grounding and breath-centered approach. The title and description emphasize relaxation and ease, with phrases like 'comfy stretch,' 'relax and de-stress,' and 'unwind after a long day.' This suggests an unhurried, intentional practice consistent with Zen Flow. The tags and description also highlight beginner-friendly and flexibility-focused elements, reinforcing the gentle nature of this stretching session.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Comfort Moves' vibe is supported by user comments and the channel's emphasis on beginner-friendly and accessible workouts. Comments describe the session as comfortable and suitable for those out of shape, indicating a safe and cozy workout environment.\n\nFinally, 'The Reboot Workout' is mildly represented here, as the routine is described as a total-body refresh and a way to boost flexibility and health. While the primary focus is on comfort and calmness rather than active recovery, the soothing stretches provide elements of a refreshing reboot.\n\nOverall, the metadata aligns strongly with a calming and accessible yoga flow, underscoring the high confidence in the vibe selection."
