  "categoriesExplanation": "The video 'Full Body Guided Workout | Session 1' features a comprehensive workout focusing on full-body engagement, which is consistent with the channel's known emphasis on short, effective workouts often involving HIIT, as evidenced by mentions in the channel description and tags like 'intense'. The description mentions increased strength and sculpting, aligning with strength training. While HIIT isn't explicitly stated, it's inferred from the channel's frequent use of this method, thus scoring 0.65 for HIIT due to the context and typical style. \n\nTags like 'no equipment' and the user comment about doing exercises without weights suggest bodyweight exercises are involved, justifying a 0.7 score for 'Body weight'. \n\nHowever, terms like 'weights' and 'weight suggestions and modifications' mentioned in user comments indicate some degree of weightlifting might be present, though not central. Thus, 'Weight workout' receives a score of 0.6. Overall confidence is high due to consistency with the channel's typical style and workout methodology."
