  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a guided meditation for self-love, which inherently involves basic relaxation and mental focus exercises. Based on the tags such as 'meditation for beginners' and the description mentioning 'full body relaxation,' the technique difficulty is classified as Beginner. This level of meditation does not involve complex physical coordination or movement patterns, aligning perfectly with the Beginner level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The meditation is categorized under 'self love affirmations' rather than physically demanding exercises, utilizing techniques like relaxation and visualization. The 12-minute duration and the absence of physically strenuous activity suggest a Light effort level. The description confirms this by stating its suitability for 'beginners and all levels,' emphasizing its gentle nature. There are no comments or metadata indicating high physical intensity, validating a Light classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 1.0,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The Required Fitness Level is derived from both technique and effort difficulties, both of which indicate a low threshold for physical and coordination demands, supportive of a Beginner level. However, a meditation practice can benefit those at Intermediate and Advanced fitness levels as well due to emotional and mental health improvements. This is exemplified by comments highlighting emotional impacts. Thus, while its basic technique and light effort primarily align with Beginner level, broader applicability allows inclusion of Intermediate and Advanced levels."
