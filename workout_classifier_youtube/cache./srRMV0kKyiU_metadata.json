    "Thank you for adding in the workout preview at the beginning of the video as it saved me from having to fast forward through to see if this workout was a fit for me. Bonus:  the workout was awesome!!",
    "At the start of may i was a staggering 215 pounds! Now I&#39;m going into my senior year in the 180&#39;s, the lowest I&#39;ve been since middle school! I haven&#39;t noticed much physical change, but I sure do love seeing that smaller number on the scale. I&#39;m hoping I start noticing changes soon....thanks hasfit for giving me my life back!!!",
    "Started on Beginner classes for just 15mins back in April and now I&#39;m smashing these 45min ones! THANK YOU both! :)",
    "This one was brutal, thank you so much guys! Cl\u00e1udia is the fittest preagnant ever!",
    "Awesome workout!!! Really appreciated the mini breaks in between. It kept me going thru the entire duration of the workout. Sweat was pouring !!! Claudia is the real trooper !"
