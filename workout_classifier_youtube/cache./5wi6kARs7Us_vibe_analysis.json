  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe 'The Firestarter' was chosen with a strong score of 0.75 due to several indicators in the video metadata that highlight intense, short bursts of effort. The workout features a 30-20-10 rest pyramid with repeated 'all out' bursts, characteristic of explosive, fast-paced routines. Furthermore, the frequent emphasis on 'extreme,' 'hardcore,' and aims for rapid weight loss support this classification.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Progression Quest' scored 0.7 because the metadata outlines a scaled progression strategy where viewers are encouraged to complete multiple sets ('repeat 1-to-3 times') and increase effort ('as you get in shape'). This approach aligns with long-term improvement objectives.\n\nLastly, 'The Endorphin Wave' is matched with a score of 0.65 as there's an overarching theme of achieving high energy and burn (staying above 80% max speed), coupled with motivational elements. The comments and description underscore the feel-good results post-workout, evident from user testimonials of weight loss and increased fitness.\n\nOverall confidence in the classification is high at 0.8, given explicit language in the metadata and user comments that align with these workout vibes."
