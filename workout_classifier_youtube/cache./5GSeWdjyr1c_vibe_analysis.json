  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled 'A Guided Meditation on the Body, Space, and Awareness with Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche' is chiefly categorized under 'The Zen Flow' vibe, due to its focus on grounding, mindfulness, and breath-centered practices. The description emphasizes embracing the present moment and bringing awareness to various sensory experiences, supported by Buddhist meditation teachings. The high view count and impactful user comments convey emotional depth, reinforcing the profound and unhurried nature typical of 'The Zen Flow'. This vibe scores highly (0.9) due to clear alignment with meditation and breath-centered practice. \n\nThe 'Deep Recharge' vibe is applicable because of the video's potential for nervous system reset, as implied by comments on its profound impact on mental health and emotional healing. The meditation serves as an ultra-gentle form of movement for deep relaxation, justifying a moderate score (0.7).\n\n'The Mindful Walk' is considered with a lower confidence score (0.5) due to the meditative, immersive nature suggested in the title and comments. However, its seated setting and lack of a story-driven format divert from the typical walking focus of this vibe, resulting in lower confidence and score."
