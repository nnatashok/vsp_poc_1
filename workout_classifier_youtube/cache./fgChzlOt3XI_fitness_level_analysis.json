  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is predominantly 'Beginner' as guided meditation primarily involves simple tasks such as sitting comfortably, listening, visualizing, and concentrating on provided commentary. These activities require minimal physical coordination and effort, making it accessible to those completely new to meditation. The mention of potential difficulty in concentration suggests a slight elevation towards 'Intermediate', but this is minor.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is 'Light' as this is a meditation session lasting 15 minutes. It involves low energy expenditure, likely involving sitting still and focusing on thoughts. This aligns with typical characteristics of meditation, which is physically undemanding and more about mental relaxation than physical exertion, as suggested by the title and description.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is predominantly 'Beginner' because meditation requires no physical fitness, only mental presence and calmness. However, the mention of potential concentration challenges mildly aligns it with 'Intermediate' for users who might find mental focus initially challenging, but overall technical difficulty in execution remains low and effort is light."
