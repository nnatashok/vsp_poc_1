  "vibesExplanation": "The video title and description focus on 'deep core activation' and 'core exercises,' indicating a strong technique and skill-building aspect typical of \"The Masterclass Workout.\" The workout is also described as challenging over 14 days, suggesting a focus on progress and improvement largely associated with \"The Progression Quest.\" This is further supported by user comments indicating noticeable improvements and ongoing efforts over multiple days. The description's emphasis on \"teaching deep core activation\" aligns with a foundational focus, characteristic of \"The Foundation Builder,\" although this is less pronounced compared to other vibes. The tags and channel content suggest a Pilates-oriented workout geared towards improving core strength systematically, with tags like 'core activation' and 'pilates abs workout,' indicating a methodical, instructional approach. The confidence level is high due to explicit metadata referencing technique and progression."
