  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Stretching,' with a high score of 0.9, due to explicit mentions of 'stretching exercises,' 'relaxing stretches,' 'stretches to do before bed,' 'easy stretching routine,' and 'stretches for better sleep' in the tags and description. These indicate a clear focus on flexibility and relaxation exercises. The title also emphasizes 'Stretching Exercises' and a 'Relaxing Routine,' strengthening this classification. \n\nA secondary category with a lower score of 0.3 is 'Yoga.' While yoga is not explicitly mentioned, the focus on relaxation and bedtime routines, coupled with the mental well-being benefits, suggests some overlap with restorative yoga practices. However, due to the lack of direct mentions or common yoga terminology, this is a less confident secondary category.\n\nThe channel's focus on beginner and senior-friendly workouts supports the low-impact nature, typical of stretching exercises, further increasing confidence in the primary category. Other categories like 'Pilates' or 'Meditation' were considered but excluded due to lack of specific mentions or distinctive elements fitting those categories."
