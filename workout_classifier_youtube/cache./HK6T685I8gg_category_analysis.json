  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified under the 'Meditation' category with a very high confidence (1.0) due to explicit indicators from the title, description, and tags clearly emphasizing meditation practice. The title 'A Deeper Connection with Your Higher Self (Guided Meditation)' directly mentions 'guided meditation', which is further reinforced by the repeated use of the term in tags such as 'guided meditation', 'morning meditation', and 'higher self meditation'. The description elaborates on aligning thoughts and actions with one's higher self, reflecting on dreams, and trusting one's intuition, all of which are common themes in meditation content focused on mindfulness and spirituality. The channel itself, Great Meditation, specializes in creating original guided meditation content. Comments also reflect intense emotional experiences characteristic of meditation, supporting this classification. Other categories such as 'Breathing exercises' or 'Yoga' were considered but were excluded due to the lack of any specific mention or focus on breathing techniques or physical postures typically associated with those categories."
