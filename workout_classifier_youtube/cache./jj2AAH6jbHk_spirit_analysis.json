  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a score of 0.8. The title 'Hip Mobility Routine' and description emphasize improving flexibility and mobility, which aligns with relaxation and recovery-focused activities. The mentions of 'warm-up or cool-down' in the description further suggest a gentle, restorative approach rather than an intense workout.\n\nAdditionally, comments like \"chill out here\" and user experiences indicating reduced discomfort and increased relaxation from the routine underscore the restorative aspect.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit also scores 0.7, mostly due to the 'flow' reference in the tags such as 'mobility flow.' The structure of the video as a 'follow along' routine suggests a continuous, rhythmic, and connected series of movements.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' was considered but not selected due to a lack of emphasis on precise technical training or progressive overload."
