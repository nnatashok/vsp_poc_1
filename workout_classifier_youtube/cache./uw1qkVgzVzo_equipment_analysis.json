  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is explicitly described as an \"encore to the end of any cycling workout\" and is produced by a channel named \"Kaleigh Cohen Cycling,\" strongly suggesting that an exercise bike is central to the workout. The description mentions RPMs (a common metric in cycling), different positions on the bike like seated, standing, and climbing, and resistance levels, all of which are specific to cycling workouts on an exercise bike. The confidence score is very high (0.95) because the metadata clearly indicates that an exercise bike is required for performing this workout."
