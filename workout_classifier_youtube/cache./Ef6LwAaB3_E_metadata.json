    "Here is a 5 minute routine to get your body moving! This is perfect for first thing in the morning, before bed, as a cool down, or even in the middle of your work day! We all know how important stretching is... now there&#39;s no excuses! \u2764\ufe0f Sending you all so much love!",
    "hearing every joint in my body pop is such a satisfying feeling. I have to modify some of the poses cause I&#39;m plus size and also not nearly as flexible, but I love that this is a straight forward quick workout and I LOVE the inclusion of the little timer in the corner, helps me a lot to know how much longer I have to hold a pose.",
    "Stretching is C R U C I A L!!! I&#39;m at the point where I cannot not do a stretch after and I MUST warm-up before a workout. Thank you for sharing this Maddie! Great all-around stretch.",
    "Damn didnt realize how unfit and badly neglected my body was until I was lowkey puffing in this 5 minute STRETCH \ud83e\udd21 like ohggggggg but I have NO regrets I feel amazing, good motivation for my morning workout tomorrow I cant wait to do this stretch again pre/post workout \ud83d\ude02)",
    "I mean, I&#39;m not super busy, not even busy... But it&#39;s so much easier to motivate myself to 5 min rather than 30 \ud83d\ude02"
