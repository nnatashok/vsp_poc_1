    "The pacing of this workout was perfect for someone who hasn\u2019t worked out in way too long! Slow paced enough for you to keep up and feel relaxed but challenging enough where you actually feel the burn, I\u2018m so glad I came across your video! Not a big fan of high intensity and fast paced workouts so this was perfect \u2764",
    "You know why I keep coming back to this video? Because you said, \u201cthis is what youre here for\u2014 to build a healthy spine. a healthy body; a body you can age in with ease and grace. thats what were here for\u201d. I feel inspired and proud everytime I hear this line from you, Issa. Thank you and your videos. You\u2019re helping me get back on track on building a healthier body and spine. Much love from the Philippines. \u2764\u2764\u2764",
    "First time I&#39;ve tried Pilates and this was just at the right level. I didn&#39;t expect the video to also lift my mood as much as it did, her positivity is infectious. Thank you Isa! \u2600",
    "LOVE this video! Getting back into Pilates after 10+ years of not doing it...and this was perfect! And to have a Black woman instructor--the best part! Thank you!!!",
    "As an overweight beginner student, I have given up often getting frustrated with what the most instructors claim to be beginner friendly. But this had me engaged, challenged and eager to get stronger so I can eventually do all of these with max potential. Loved this class."
