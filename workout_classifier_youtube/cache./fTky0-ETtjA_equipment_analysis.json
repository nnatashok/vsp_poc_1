  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is a Pilates arm routine emphasizing the use of light weights, as indicated explicitly in both the title ('Quick Upper Body Workout with Light Weights') and description ('Join me for an arm workout with weights'). The tags also consistently refer to 'light weights' and 'arms workout with equipment'. It is directly mentioned in the description that the instructor uses 1kg dumbbells and suggests they can be replaced with household items like cans or water bottles, but strongly implies that some form of weight is central to enhancing the exercise. The comments further reinforce this by discussing the effectiveness of the workout with 2lb weights, thus warranting a very high confidence level (0.9) for the requirement of dumbbells."
