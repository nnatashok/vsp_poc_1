  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled '5-Minute Meditation You Can Do Anywhere' from the Goodful channel strongly embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The title and tags such as 'soothing', 'relaxation', 'calm', and 'stress relief' clearly indicate a focus on relaxation and recovery. The description highlights the use of John Davisi's 'incredibly soothing voice', further emphasizing the meditative and healing nature of the content. User comments reflect a supportive, calming environment, often associated with meditation practices. The video length of 5 minutes suggests a quick, accessible session designed to offer a brief but effective restoration. The channel's motto, \"Feel better, be better, and do better,\" aligns with the theme of personal wellness and recovery. There is strong confidence (1.0) in this classification as all elements point toward a primary focus on soothing and restorative qualities, excluding other spirits as there are no indications of intensity, structure, or physical adventure."
