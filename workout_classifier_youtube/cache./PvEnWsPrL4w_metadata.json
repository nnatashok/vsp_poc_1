    "I started with one of your beginner workouts one year ago, I was at 202 pounds 5\u20191. I barely made it each time!\ud83d\ude29 but I kept it up every day with a 30 minute walk after. I can proudly say I am  currently 142 pounds! Thank you so much, I owe so much to your encouragement and workout! \ud83d\udc4d",
    "I finished this no stopping no pauses....I am in tears this is a celebration and motivation...thanks",
    "Daniel makes me think of a phrase that I love so much I printed it on a shirt: exercise is a celebration of what your body can do, not punishment for what you ate.",
    "I lost 50 pounds over the course of 2020, and went from being clinically \u201coverweight\u201d to a healthy weight for my height and age range. I also went from being a complete couch potato, to completing 30-60 mins of yoga daily , 5-7 times a week. Now that I\u2019m actively maintaining this healthy weight and lifestyle, I\u2019ve found your videos as a way of introducing cardio into my life.<br><br>When you said that this workout isn\u2019t about winning or losing, but \u201cparticipating,\u201d I had to pause the video and have a little cry. I rarely refer to my health and weight loss process as a \u201cjourney,\u201d but I\u2019m starting to appreciate it as just that; a journey that I\u2019m still on. I can\u2019t thank you enough for these videos, for the diversity of participants you show, for the clothes they wear (I can\u2019t tell you how demotivating is is to follow along with a guide wearing a belly top and skin-toned leggings), and for the positive message you share. It\u2019s so helpful to so many.",
    "He was right when he said &quot;starting is the hardest part&quot; and he is right, today I was like &quot;ugh, I dont wanna do this&quot; now that I&#39;m done I&#39;m like &quot;I&#39;m glad I did that&quot;"
