  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is primarily classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is supported by the title and description mentioning 'Best Indoor Cycling Training Cardio Session' and 'Get your heart pumping with GCN's cardio session,' indicating a focus on cardiovascular and high-intensity training. Additionally, user comments frequently mention the workout's intensity, such as increased heart rates and burning legs, reinforcing this classification.\n\nThe session is also 'Structured & Disciplined,' scoring 0.8. The description outlines a 'pyramid structure' with specific pedalling speeds and mentions guidance through the training session by Daniel Lloyd, emphasizing a methodical approach. This is indicative of a disciplined workout format.\n\nThere is a mild element of 'Outdoor & Adventure,' scoring 0.4, primarily because of the simulated ride 'up the beautiful Col de Soller in Mallorca' and the visual distraction provided by Mallorcan scenery. However, the indoor nature reduces this element's strength.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm,' 'Soothing & Restorative,' and 'Sport & Agility' were not applicable due to the high-intensity structure and lack of restorative or agility-focused elements."
