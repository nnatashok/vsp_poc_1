  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video '10 Minute Yoga Full Body Stretch for Stiff Bodies' primarily embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as evidenced by the title and description which emphasize 'gentle,' 'release tension,' and 'stiff bodies.' The practice is described as perfect for morning or anytime when movement is needed, suggesting a restorative and relaxing approach suitable for everyone, including those with physical stiffness or ailments, as supported by user comments.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present, though to a lesser extent. The use of the term 'yoga' and references to a 'full body stretch' indicate smooth, continuous movements typical of a yoga flow, which contributes to a mind-body connection. Comments mentioning emotional release and peace further support this classification.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the low intensity and gentle nature of the practice, which doesn't aim to push physical limits or develop athletic skills."
