  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence score of 0.9. The session is described as a 'therapeutic sequence' focusing on stress relief, tension reduction, and the alleviation of shoulder and neck pain. Keywords like \"neck tension,\" \"shoulder pain,\" \"reduce inflammation,\" and \"increase range of motion\" emphasize a gentle and healing focus, which aligns perfectly with the soothing spirit. The description and user comments highlight the restorative benefits users have experienced, such as stress relief and improved neck condition.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' receives a lower score of 0.4. While the video is not primarily driven by musical or movement flow, yoga inherently involves smooth, continuous movements and a mind-body connection, elements associated with 'Flow & Rhythm.' However, these aspects are secondary to the restorative nature of the routine, hence the lower score. High-energy, structured, sport, or adventure spirits are not relevant as the focus is on relaxation and healing."
