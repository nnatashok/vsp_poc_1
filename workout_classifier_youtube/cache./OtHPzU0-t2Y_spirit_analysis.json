  "spiritsExplanation": "The title 'Daily Breathing Exercises in 12 Minutes' and description emphasize stress reduction, focus improvement, and balance through breath control, strongly aligning with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The frequent reference to meditation and relaxation (e.g., 'reduce stress' and 'calm your nerves') further supports this classification, warranting a high confidence score of 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, there is a 'Structured & Disciplined' element evident from the requirement for consistency ('daily breathing exercises') and the focus on a methodical approach to improvement ('significant changes in your body and mind'), which is typical of this spirit. This is supported by the channel's focus on discipline and habit-building. Therefore, this spirit receives a moderate confidence score of 0.6.\n\nTags like 'breathing meditation' and comments from older participants further highlight the relaxed and therapeutic nature, excluding high-energy or sports-related spirits due to lack of intensity or sport-specific indicators."
