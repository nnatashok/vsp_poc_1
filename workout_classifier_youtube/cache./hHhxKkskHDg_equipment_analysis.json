  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video outlined is a 30-minute morning yoga session designed by 'Yoga with Kassandra.' According to the metadata, specifically the description and tags, this particular class is a 'no props yoga' session, implying that no additional equipment is required aside from the basics typically associated with yoga. The mention of 'Rise and shine, it's time to get on your mat and flow with me!' suggests that a yoga mat is used, but since the primary focus is on body movements and poses like deer, laying triangle, etc., without any additional equipment or props, no specific items from the given equipment list are required. Thus, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, designed for flexibility and strength via various yoga poses, and does not necessitate any of the equipment options provided, rendering the classified array empty."
