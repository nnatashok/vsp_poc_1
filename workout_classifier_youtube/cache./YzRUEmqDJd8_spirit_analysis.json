  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, which is strongly supported by the metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'Guided Meditation for Healing Anxiety, PTSD, Panic & Stress,' indicating a focus on mental healing and stress reduction. Tags such as 'guided meditation,' 'stress relief,' 'calming,' and 'deep relaxation' further emphasize the restorative qualities of the session. The description outlines a gentle practice incorporating diaphragmatic breathing and peace affirmations, both of which are techniques aimed at relaxation and mental well-being. The channel branding and consistent content of relaxation and meditation reinforce this classification. Additionally, user comments reflect profound personal relief and emotional support, consistent with restorative practices. There is no evidence supporting other workout spirits, as the focus is on mental, rather than physical, exercise."
