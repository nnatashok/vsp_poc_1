  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Stretching' due to the explicit mention in the title, description, and several tags indicating a focus on stretching routines. The title '5 Minute Morning Stretches' and many user comments emphasize quick stretching exercises intended for flexibility and energy enhancement. The description describes the workout as 'morning stretches' to start the day, further reinforcing this classification. The score for 'Stretching' is 0.7, reflecting strong but not exclusive focus on stretching, given the overlap with Pilates elements.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Pilates', with a score of 0.5. This is supported by multiple tags such as 'pilates for energy', 'beginner pilates', and 'energizing morning pilates'. The channel is run by a Pilates teacher, suggesting that even stretching routines are likely influenced by Pilates techniques. However, since the primary emphasis appears to be on stretching rather than classic Pilates exercises, the score is slightly lower.\n\nThe classification excludes 'Yoga' despite tags like 'morning yoga' because there is stronger evidence for traditional stretching and Pilates influences rather than yoga postures."
