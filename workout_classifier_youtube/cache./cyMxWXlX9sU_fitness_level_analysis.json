  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner', as there are no physical demands that would impose restrictions, and the meditation is specifically mentioned to be suitable for all levels, including beginners. A small score is given to 'Intermediate' to account for anyone with some experience in meditation who might still find value in the practice, but the content aligns very strongly with 'Beginner' based on its non-physical nature."
