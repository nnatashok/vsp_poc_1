  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is 'Yoga' with a very high confidence score of 0.95. This is evident from the title 'Yoga To Feel Your Best', the frequent use of the term 'yoga' in the tags and description, and the channel's focus on yoga sessions. Furthermore, the description mentions 'Hop on the mat for this 22-minute yoga session', explicitly identifying it as a yoga workout.\n\nThe 'Stretching' category is also relevant as the description mentions 'Stretch your body', indicating that this session includes significant stretching exercises typical of yoga routines. Thus, a moderate score of 0.7 is assigned to Stretching.\n\nBreathing exercises are part of many yoga practices, and the description\u2019s phrase 'tap into conscious breath' suggests elements of breathing exercises, justifying a score of 0.4 for this category.\n\nOther potential categories like 'Meditation' or 'Pilates' were considered irrelevant due to the lack of specific metadata support. Overall, the alignment with the channel's yoga-centric content boosts the confidence in this classification."
