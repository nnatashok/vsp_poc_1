  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout titled 'Yoga Full Body Stretches for Tension and Sore Muscles' is clearly focused on providing relief and relaxation, fitting well within the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with high confidence (0.95). Keywords in the title and description such as 'tension relief', 'sore muscles', and 'feel your best mentally and physically' emphasize recovery and relaxation aspects. The tags reinforce this focus, highlighting 'yoga for tension', 'restorative', and 'sore muscle relief'. Over 2.1 million views suggest its widespread appeal in relaxation and wellness routines.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit receives a lower score (0.4) due to the continuous, smooth nature of yoga, especially in stretching routines that often utilize flowing sequences to connect body and breath, as supported by the positive comments about how the session felt emotionally supportive and not overly intense.\n\nOther spirits were not selected due to lack of explicit mention or implication of intensity, structure, sports-specificity, or outdoor elements, thus excluding those from consideration in this analysis."
