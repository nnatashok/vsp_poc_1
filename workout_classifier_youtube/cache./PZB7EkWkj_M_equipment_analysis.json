  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a \"45 MIN FULL BODY YOGA FLOW || Vinyasa Flow For Balance, Flexibility & Strength,\" which typically requires a mat for performing the poses comfortably as it involves floor exercises commonly associated with yoga. The description specifically mentions a Mat from Liforme, and a discount code is provided, further indicating its necessity. Tags such as \"yoga,\" \"vinyasa flow,\" and \"yoga for balance,\" align with the need for a mat. Therefore, I assign a very high confidence score of 1.0 to the requirement of a Mat."
