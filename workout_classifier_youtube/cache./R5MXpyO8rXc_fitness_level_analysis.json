  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves exercises such as Arnold Presses, Romanian Deadlifts, and Curtsy Lunges, which require a moderate degree of coordination and form execution, typical of intermediate-level technique complexity. The inclusion of complex movements like Pallof Press and Standing Bicycle, which demand good core engagement and coordination, suggests advanced technique elements as well. The no-repeat format and the various standing exercises increase the complexity, contributing to an overall intermediate to advanced classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a 24-minute duration, consisting of 60 seconds of work followed by 20 seconds rest, the structure demands sustained activity, leaning towards moderate effort, especially for deconditioned users. The mixed upper and lower body exercises imply significant effort due to the peripheral heart action training. The moderate weight suggestion and exercise variety contribute to a challenging effort level, particularly the 20-minute uninterrupted work demand for multiple muscle groups, typical of challenging workouts. However, due to modifications offered, many can adjust the difficulty to fit their fitness level.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout's intensity and no-repeat structure suggest it is most suitable for intermediate users, especially given the weight-based exercises and the option to choose weights. The availability of modifications and standing-only format allow beginners to participate with adjustments, justifying the beginner level inclusion. The diverse exercises and peripheral heart action suggest that more experienced exercisers will also find the workout beneficial for an advanced fitness demand. Therefore, multiple fitness levels are appropriate to encompass varied user capabilities and needs."
