  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen for this workout is HIIT, with a high score of 0.95, as indicated by the title '45 MIN MILITARY MONDAY Killer HIIT Workout' and multiple mentions of HIIT in the tags and description ('killer HIIT workout', 'intense hiit', 'hiit workout'). The workout is described as intense, targeting full body strength and endurance, typical of HIIT programming. The structure involves intervals of 50 seconds work and 10 seconds rest, further supporting the HIIT categorization.\n\nThe secondary category is Body weight, with a score of 0.6, since the video description specifies 'No Equipment,' indicating reliance on body weight for resistance. Such workouts often focus on bodyweight movements like push-ups, squats, and lunges, aligning with the channel's past CrossFit influence.\n\nFinally, Mat has been assigned a lower score of 0.4. While not explicitly stated, the nature of no equipment workouts usually involves exercises that can be performed on a mat, particularly considering the channel's content description (e.g., 'see you on the mat').\n\nOther categories like Indoor biking, Treadmill, or Weight workout are excluded due to lack of any mention of machines or weights."
