  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit identified is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.7. This is due to the consistent emphasis on flow and coordination in the metadata. The phrase 'Flow with Mira' in the channel name, repeated mentions of 'flow' in tags, and the description underlining a smooth, coordinated movement suggest a rhythmic style. \n\nAnother spirit, 'Structured & Disciplined', scores 0.6. The structured, methodical approach is indicated by the workout's focus on core strength, flexibility, and technical aspects essential in Pilates, which inherently involves discipline and precision. The serialized beginner program offering also supports this classification.\n\nFinally, 'Soothing & Restorative' receives a score of 0.4. While not the central focus, indicators such as the channel's emphasis on developing a 'deeper connection to your body' and promoting balance, hint at a calming, restorative element, but given the Pilates context, it does not dominate the session.\n\nTags and user comments consistently highlight a beginner-friendly, structured approach, and confirm the lack of high-energy elements or overt athletic focus, ruling out other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility.'"
