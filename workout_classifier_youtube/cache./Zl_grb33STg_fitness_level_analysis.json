  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves compound movements like squats and lat pulldowns, which generally require coordination and body awareness. Lighter weights and higher reps are recommended, which reduces the risk of injury and technique complexity slightly, but proper form is still crucial to execute these effectively. Therefore, the technique difficulty is rated between Intermediate and Advanced.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout requires lighter weights with higher reps, which can increase cardiovascular demand and calorie burn. Compound movements and the advice to take shorter breaks add to the effort level. The 10:45 duration suggests it's not overly taxing, but the nature of lighter weights and high reps with minimal rest pushes it towards a Challenging effort level for less fit individuals.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the combination of intermediate to advanced technique difficulty and moderate to challenging effort, this workout is best suited for Intermediate users but could also be manageable for Beginners with some exercise experience, given the lighter weights and potential for modification. Advanced trainees will also find value due to the higher reps and shorter rest maximizing calorie burn. This inclusive approach aligns with the need to encompass a broad range of abilities."
