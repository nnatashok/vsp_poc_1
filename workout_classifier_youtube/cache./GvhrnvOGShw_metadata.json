    "Dude, I&#39;ve been working this 4 days a week since mid October and I&#39;m getting stronger!  I had a heart attack 6 years ago and really need this cardio to build endurance for horseback riding.  Thank you!",
    "A well done and encouraging video. Thanks.<br><br>In the opening  moments of this workout, however, to those with ellipticals capable of measuring speed in miles per hour you recommend a speed of 16mph, perhaps even 18mph. With my machine and its 20&quot; stride length, 16mph equates to nearly 845 strides per minute, and 18mph requires 950 strides per minute. My rough estimate based on your video is that at your top speed, you&#39;re producing in the neighborhood of 165-170 strides per minute. Stride rates necessary to produce 16-18mph rates are obviously not possible, so I&#39;m confident you meant to refer to different speed targets. Can you offer a revision?",
    "1st time! It was good!",
    "It took me a few goes to know the full resistance of my machine, follow all the instructions and work out my max effort but today I managed to get all the way through and it felt great. I want to get to the point I can do it twice through, maybe even thrice \ud83d\ude03",
    "I loved the workout. I wasn&#39;t able to follow resistance level. I did see the description below. Will try to follow that. I think I am more visual person. Wish you put resistance level in the video. But thank you for your effort."
