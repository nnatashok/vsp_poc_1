  "categoriesExplanation": "The video titled '15-Minute Guided Meditation to Reset Your Nervous System' strongly suggests that the primary focus of this content is meditation. This is explicitly stated in the title and supported by multiple references in the description and tags, such as 'guided meditation', '15 minute guided meditation', 'vagus nerve meditation', and 'mindfulness'. Given this strong emphasis, the category of Meditation receives the highest score of 1.0.\n\nBreathing exercises are also mentioned as part of the practice, particularly in the description where it mentions 'breathing easily'. Although breathing exercises are not the main focus, they appear to be a significant component of the session, meriting a score of 0.6 for this category.\n\nThe 'Other' category is assigned a minor score of 0.2 to account for any additional elements that do not strictly fall under Meditation or Breathing exercises. For instance, the channel's broader focus includes yoga and restorative practices, suggesting a holistic approach that might extend beyond straightforward meditation.\n\nThe channel's description and comments further reinforce the strong meditation theme, with viewers expressing benefits typical of meditation practices, such as relaxation and stress relief. Other workout categories were excluded due to the lack of physical exertion or movement-based elements in the metadata."
