    "Mom of 6 here.  At 5:30am, I put banana bread in the oven and then jumped on the treadmill. This is my favorite video to follow. I get at least 2.5 miles in 30 minutes.  I love this channel! Thank you for helping me hit my personal goals, however my schedule changes daily \u2764",
    "Great for upcoming hiking \ud83e\udd7e. That final 3 mins, wow. Love your encouragement and willingness to push even more but in a nice way, tapping into our motivation. Very skilled. \u2764",
    "I absolutely love this HIIT video \u2014 especially because it&#39;s beginner friendly, but you can make it more challenging by upping the pace. I started off on the lower end of the paces,but now can complete the workout in the middle of the paces! Thank you coach Rachael and IBX Running team!!! You have helped me to love running again, and become a staple activity of my day.",
    "Omg this was AMAZING. I almost didnt work out but your encouraging comments kept me motivated and I finished the workout!! Im so proud of myseld. Thank you IBX!!"
