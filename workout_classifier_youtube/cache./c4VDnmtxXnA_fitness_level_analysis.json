  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily beginner since basic breathwork is involved, which doesn't demand cardiovascular fitness or strength. However, intermediate users might find it beneficial due to potential mindfulness and emotional depth aspects. The technique remains simple enough for beginners, but the potential for deeper self-awareness suggests that those with some experience in mindfulness or yoga might engage more profoundly, hence the added intermediate score."
