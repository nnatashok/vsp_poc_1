  "categoriesExplanation": "The main category selected is 'Pilates' with a high score of 0.9 due to several strong indicators in the metadata. The title, 'TONE WITH PILATES in 14 Days \ud83d\udd25 Full Body Pilates Workout | 20 min,' explicitly mentions 'Pilates' as the primary form of exercise. The description reinforces this by describing the workout as part of a '2 Week Full Body Pilates Sculpt & Fat Burn Guide.' Additionally, tags like 'pilates workout,' 'full body pilates,' and 'mat pilates' further confirm that Pilates is the central element of the workout.\n\nThe second category is 'Mat' with a score of 0.7, as the workout is described as a 'full body workout' performed at home, typically on a mat. This is supported by user comments referring to exercises that are characteristic of mat workouts, such as core and lower body movements, and the metadata's emphasis on 'full body home workout' and 'mat pilates.'\n\nOther categories, such as 'Body weight' and 'Stretching,' were considered but excluded due to lack of explicit emphasis on these elements in the core content of the workout."
