    "Happy February, my friends! Today&#39;s short session is perfect for a little check in to transform your mood/energy! 11 minutes for CARE. Are you taking some time to care for YOU?",
    "I suffer from Carpal tunnel syndrome in both of my wrists and its not something with much of a &#39;cure&#39;, I wouldn&#39;t consider surgery so tend to just live with it, this session has truly helped me, it seems to be the only thing that brings pain relief, don&#39;t get me wrong, when I&#39;m in alot of pain with my wrists, everything hurts including Yoga, but this session is worth the slight discomfort because it works wonders, Thank you so much Adrian, you&#39;re my hero\u2661",
    "I am 70 years old and used my hands a lot as a Firefighter and as a Service Technician. I had troubles with &quot;Trigger Finger&quot;, stiffness and some arthritis with the fingers and early stages of carpel tunnel.  My daughter led me to your video &quot;Yoga For Hands, Fingers, Wrists&quot;.  I just want to say this video has helped me to enjoy retirement and out of surgery.  Thank you , Thank you, Thank you. Neal",
