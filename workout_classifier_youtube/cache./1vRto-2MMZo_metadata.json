    "from someone who ABSOLUTELY HATES working out because of how boring it is, this got me laughing and smiling and actually having fun!! this motivates me to keep going!!",
    "More like this please!! 30 minutes would be perfect !! With 2000\u2019 songs it changes everything !! Thanks !",
    "who else agrees that she should do more song compilation workouts like this",
    "I like how this had actual dance moves that are just more defined in it and not just exercises disguised as dance moves. I love this"
