    "This is perfect for me as I\u2019m trying to regain strength after being bedridden for several months. I lost so much muscle and am very weak, so it\u2019s a good way for me to (at my own pace) begin to strengthen myself enough that I can eventually increase activity. Thanks very much for making this available!",
    "I work away at sea, high quality no equipment vids that genuinely use no equipment are priceless, thank you",
    "Now this one is perfect. The set up, the clock, the bar, the routine, the relaxed voice, all of it. (Just wondering why you kept pausing the clock during those side planks????? )",
    "Just happened upon your video &amp; watched the entire thing. Love it &amp; love that you had it all timed &amp; you went through the whole 15 minutes yourself<br> Thank you. Will do these &amp; look for more of your videos."
