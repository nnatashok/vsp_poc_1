  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as \"Structured & Disciplined\" with a score of 0.75 due to the clear, methodical organization described in the video metadata. The use of terms such as \"muscular-endurance,\" \"advanced strength training,\" and the outlined structure of grouped exercises indicates a focused and orderly training protocol. The emphasis on progressing weights also suggests a disciplined approach.\n\n\"High-Energy & Intense\" receives a score of 0.65, supported by the word \"advanced\" in both the title and tags. The fast-paced nature, suggested by comments indicating a tough and quick workout, aligns with an intense effort.\n\n\"Flow & Rhythm\" earns a 0.5, reflecting the continuous movement pattern implied by phrases like \"back-to-back-to-back\" exercises, which suggests a rhythm in the execution. However, this is a secondary spirit since the main focus is on strength and endurance.\n\nThe channel's consistent approach to strength workouts and user comments about the quick and energizing nature further reinforce these classifications."
