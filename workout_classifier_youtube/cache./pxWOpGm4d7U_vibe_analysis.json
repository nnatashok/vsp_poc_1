  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe, \"The Zen Flow,\" was chosen due to strong indicators of a grounding, intentional, and breath-centered experience described in the metadata. The title, description, and tags emphasize relaxation and stress relief, key aspects of this vibe. The inclusion of \"gentle neck stretches,\" \"full body relaxation,\" and \"visualization\" align with the unhurried nature of slow-flow yoga or tai chi, justifying a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe second vibe, \"The Deep Recharge,\" scored an 0.85 as the video content signifies a nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement, especially given the focus on anxiety relief and cultivating peace. This vibe is supported by user comments expressing profound relaxation and emotional relief.\n\nLastly, \"The Sleep Prep\" is given a lower score of 0.5 due to its modest alignment; the video aids in winding down and easing tension, although not explicitly cited as bedtime preparation-focused. The soft mood it imparts overlaps with this vibe partially: preparing for mental rest and tranquility."
