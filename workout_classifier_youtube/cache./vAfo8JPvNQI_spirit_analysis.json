  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is predominantly characterized by a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as evidenced by the focus on meditation, relaxation, and healing. Keywords such as 'guided meditation', 'mindfulness', 'healing', 'relaxation', and 'calm clarity' strongly indicate a restorative nature aimed at stress reduction and mental well-being, justifying a high score of 0.95.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is present but less dominant, reflected in the continuous nature of guided meditation which follows a rhythmic and holistic flow focusing on mind-body connection. This is supported by terms like 'guided', 'meditation music', and 'energy flow', leading to a moderate score of 0.55.\n\nThere is a mild presence of 'Structured & Disciplined' elements, primarily through the methodological approach to meditation and the progression suggested by \"returning to full, conscious alertness,\" warranting a lower score of 0.35.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to the lack of indicators related to high intensity, athletic performance, or natural environment characteristics in the metadata."
