  "categoriesExplanation": "The video titled '10 Minute Guided Breathing Meditation' clearly positions itself as a meditation session, particularly focused on breathing techniques. The use of terms such as 'guided meditation,' 'mindfulness meditation,' and 'meditation breathing' in the tags strongly supports the classification of the primary category as 'Meditation,' earning it a high score of 0.9 due to the explicit intent to guide users into a meditative state as reflected in the description and comments. Furthermore, the emphasis on 'breathing,' both in the title and tags, suggests a significant focus on 'Breathing exercises,' justifying a secondary category with a score of 0.7. The video\u2019s channel, 'Great Meditation,' and the enthusiastic user comments about the calming and anxiety-reducing benefits of the session reinforce the classification, aligning well with meditation practices rather than broader exercise or fitness categories. Other categories are excluded due to the lack of physical activity or movement component, which are commonly associated with them."
