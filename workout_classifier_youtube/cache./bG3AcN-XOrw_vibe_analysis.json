  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe classification for this video is 'The Sleep Prep' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is strongly indicated by the video's focus on facilitating sleep through guided meditation and soothing sounds, as reflected in the title and description keywords such as 'fall asleep fast,' 'soothing rain sounds,' and 'deep and restful sleep.' The use of relaxing audio to ease tension aligns perfectly with the typical characteristics of 'Sleep Prep.'\n\nThe secondary vibe identified is 'The Deep Recharge,' receiving a score of 0.7. The description's emphasis on 'healing meditation,' 'calming sound of rain,' and 'rejuvenated sleep' suggests a broader intention of nervous system relaxation beyond just sleep, fitting with the 'Deep Recharge' classification. Although the primary aim is sleep preparation, the overall narrative and content hint at a deeper mental and physical rejuvenation.\n\nNo indicators were present for vibes such as 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Reboot Workout,' as the metadata lacks references to any active physical movement or daytime relaxation typical of these vibes."
