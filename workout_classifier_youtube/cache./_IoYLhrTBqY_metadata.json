  "title": "15 MIN DAILY STRETCH - a full body routine for tight muscles, flexibility & mobility I Pamela Reif",
  "description": "Live Session \u2665\ufe0e We train all the time .. but do you stretch? / Werbung\u00a0\n\nThis 15min Routine is perfect to do on a daily basis, to make sure our muscles and joints are not too stiff from sitting all day long or training a lot. This helps to increase your mobility and flexibility :) \n\nWe will stretch our hamstrings, thighs, hip flexors, back, work on our spine mobility and so on. It\u2019s a \u201eFull Body\u201c Session\n\nI\u2019m actually super excited for this, since I really need to step up my stretching skills :D and I\u2019m optimistic that I will stick to this better, if I will have a fix video that I can follow haha. This was definitely missing on my channel! \n\nxx\n\n__\n\nNo Equipment needed. Just prepare a soft surface like a yoga mat or towel :) \n\n__\n\n\u25b8 You can find free WORKOUT SCHEDULES on my Instagram Channel.
