  "title": "30 Min MIGHTY Full Body Workout - Dumbbells | Caroline Girvan",
  "description": "A full body workout hitting all of the major muscle groups in the upper body, and using static lunges as a staple to target the entire lower body with some RDLs for more hamstring specific! Finishing with an absolute abdominal burnout! \n\nThe timer will be on for 60 seconds per exercise with 20 seconds rest in between! \n\nAll you will need is a pair of dumbbells and your mat! \n\nThe dumbbells I am using for your reference are 17.5kg for most of the workout! I will reduce to 9kg each for shoulder press and holding during abs section!\n\nThese are straight forward compound movements with full range movement and standard tempo to allow you to perhaps lift that little bit heavier compared to if consisting of isometrics, tempo or partial reps!\n\nCHEST PRESS\nCHEST PRESS\nSTATIC LUNGE (one side)\nSWITCH SIDE!\nSHOULDER PRESS\nSHOULDER PRESS\nSTATIC LUNGE (one side)\nSWITCH SIDE!\nBENT OVER ROW (one side)\nSWITCH SIDE\nSWITCH SIDE\nSWITCH SIDE\nSTATIC LUNGE (one side)\nSWITCH SIDE!\nPULLOVER\nPULLOVER\nSTATIC LUNGE (one side)\nSWITCH SIDE!\nSTAGGERED RDL (one side)\nSWITCH SIDE\nSWITCH SIDE\nSWITCH SIDE\n\nFinisher: \n3 minutes non stop! \nDUMBBELL CRUNCH HOLD LEG LOWER\nDUMBBELL TOE REACH\nDUMBBELL CRUNCH HOLD LEG LOWER\n\n\nThe biceps are worked within the rows and triceps during chest press & shoulder press! There are no specific arms exercises due to this and compound movements such as chest press and rows recruit a lot more muscles over isolation so perfect for shorter workouts! \n\nWe finish with some ab specific exercises! Let\u2019s focus on really holding that crunch during the leg lowers, pushing the lower back well into the mat and during toe reaches, how high can you crunch and reach whilst controlling the lowering back to mat? \ud83d\ude01\n\nPerfect workout when you want a full body resistance workout in 30 minutes!\n\nHave fun!! I sure did!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd29\n\nCx\n\nAlways ensure you warm up before any workout.
