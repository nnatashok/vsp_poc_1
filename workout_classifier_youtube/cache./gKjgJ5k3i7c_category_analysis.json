  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized primarily under 'Yoga' with a high level of confidence due to numerous explicit indicators in both the title and the metadata. The title '30 MIN YOGA WORKOUT || Heart Opening Feel Good Flow' directly suggests a yoga session. The description reiterates this focus with phrases such as 'Yoga Workout', 'heart opening sequences', and 'flow through'. The tags are heavily focused on yoga-related keywords, including 'yoga workout', 'at home yoga workout', 'heart opening yoga', and 'feel good flow'. Additionally, the channel is run by a certified yoga instructor, which further supports this classification. The workout is designed to be a calming, low-impact experience as described by viewers in the comments, aligning with the characteristics of a yoga session. This led to the exclusion of other categories, such as 'Pilates', which despite being mentioned in tags, is not primarily highlighted in the video content itself."
