I'm going to take you through this beginner friendly 30 minute full body yoga flow. This is great for those who are new to yoga, students who want to move a bit slower or anyone who wants an effective yet gentle practice. We will have a mix of reclined, seated and standing yoga poses that will help with balance, strength and flexibility.\n\nI'm not using any props in this class so all you need is your mat. However, if you have some blocks at home you can keep them close by and use them to make poses more accessible. Remember to stay connected with your breath and keep the focus inwards. Take breaks when you need them and honor your body.\n\nEnjoy this 30 minute beginner yoga class!\n\nMORE BEGINNER YOGA: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0v0k7UCVrkkg0YPkBqxYHA2eT_IYlAC\n\n\u2705 SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET  http://bit.ly/ywkassandra\n\ud83d\udd14 Don\u2019t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!\n\nThanks for watching,\nKassandra\nWEB \u27a1\ufe0f http://www.yogawithkassandra.com\nINSTAGRAM \u27a1\ufe0f https://instagram.com/yoga_with_kassandra\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 MY MOBILE APP \ud83d\udcf1 Stream or download more than 800+ classes, use the in-app calendar to track and schedule classes, new exclusive challenges, classes and programs added every month \u2764\ufe0f FREE TO DOWNLOAD \u2764\ufe0f http://bit.ly/ytmobileapp\n\n\nFREE YOGA CHALLENGES\n\ud83c\udf1e 30 day Morning Yoga Challenge http://bit.ly/morning30days\n\ud83c\udf1b 30 day Evening Yoga Challenge: http://bit.ly/bedtime30\n\ud83e\uddd8 7 day Yoga & Meditation Challenge: http://bit.ly/ywk7day\n\ud83e\udd38 30 day Flexible Body, Flexible Mind Challenge: https://bit.ly/flexbodymind\n\n\nMY PUBLISHED BOOKS & PRODUCTS\n\ud83c\udf3f \"Year of Yoga\" (NEW Book+ Online Program): https://geni.us/yearofyoga\n\ud83c\udfb4 \"I Radiate Joy\" Affirmation Card Deck: https://bit.ly/affirmationdeck\n\u270d\ufe0f \"My Yoga Journey\" Guided Yoga Journal: https://bit.ly/ywkyogajournal\n\ud83d\udcd5 \"Yin Yoga: Stretch the Mindful Way\" Book: http://geni.us/ywkbook\n\ud83c\udf81 \"My Yoga Journey\" GIFT SET journal, candle + book: https://geni.us/giftsetywk\n\n\n\ud83d\uded2 SHOP MY AMAZON FAVORITES \ud83d\udecd\ufe0f\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/yogawithkassandra\n\n\nSTUDY WITH ME\n\ud83c\udf93 30 hour Yin Yoga Teacher Training: https://bit.ly/yinyttkass\n\ud83c\udf93 10 hour Vinyasa Teaching Methodologies: https://bit.ly/yttvinyasa\n\ud83d\udd49\ufe0f 10 hour Yoga Philosophy Course: https://bit.ly/ywkyama\n\u26a1 10 hour Tantra Wisdom Goddesses Course: https://bit.ly/wisdomgoddess\n\n\nYoga with Kassandra - Disclaimer\nPlease consult with your physician before beginning any exercise program.

    "I find your classes so helpful, as a 69 year old beginner. The stretching and balance helps me immensely.",
    "That was a nice, chilled class for me and my husband- both in our 70\u2019s\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
    "It really is nice to do a beginner class no matter how advanced you are.",
    "This is the perfect yoga practice to fit in no matter what! I so appreciate the no-music practice.  I choose a playlist that suits my mood and that really adds to my practice!!",
    "Love this! I&#39;m 65 years old with autoimmune arthritis, which means I am very stiff and sore in the mornings. This has helped tremendously!"
