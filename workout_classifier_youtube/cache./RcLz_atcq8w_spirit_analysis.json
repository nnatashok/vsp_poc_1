  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's high-energy and intense spirit is strongly indicated by the use of 'HIIT,' 'High intensity,' and 'burn 500 calories' in the title, description, and tags. These suggest a focus on a high-effort, calorie-torching session. User comments mention the 'after burn effect' and the metabolic boost provided by the workout, reinforcing this spirit. The description's emphasis on 'fat burn,' 'burn lots of calories,' and a '30s Work, 15s Rest' interval structure suggests an intense effort, scoring 1.0 for High-Energy & Intense. Additionally, the Structured & Disciplined spirit is present as the workout follows a specific protocol ('30s Work, 15s Rest') and methodical design 'No Equipment & No Repeat,' indicating a planned and precise session, justifying a score of 0.6. Other spirits such as Flow & Rhythm or Soothing & Restorative are less applicable given the intensity and structured interval training focus of the workout."
