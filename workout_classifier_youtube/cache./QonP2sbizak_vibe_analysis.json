  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video in question is a 'Guided Meditation for Lucid Dreaming,' with a primary focus on relaxation and inducing a state conducive to lucid dreaming. This closely aligns with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe, which involves nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement. The use of terminology such as 'progressive relaxation' and 'lucid dreaming' in the description suggests a deep, calm, and restorative experience (score: 1.0).\n\nFurthermore, the metadata and user comments show that the workout is used to prepare for sleep. Comments mentioning falling asleep and experiencing relaxation ('used to think relaxation didn\u2019t exist') indicate that the meditation provides a 'Sleep Prep' vibe, preparing participants for rest (score: 0.9).\n\nLastly, there is a grounding, intentional, and breath-centered quality in the description and comments, including progressive relaxation and deep immersion into the meditation, aligning moderately with the 'Zen Flow' vibe (score: 0.8).\n\nThe high view count, likes, and positive reception confirm the salience of these vibes, with the highest confidence in 'The Deep Recharge' and 'Sleep Prep' due to explicit mentions of relaxation and preparation for sleep. 'The Zen Flow' is slightly less pronounced but still relevant."
