  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Reboot Workout' was chosen primarily due to the video's emphasis on boosting metabolism and ensuring muscle recovery during sleep, as described in the workout video description. The workout, being cardio and resistance-based but promotes a calming pre-sleep routine, aligns it with a reboot or restorative vibe. A score of 0.7 was assigned due to strong alignment with restorative qualities. \n\n'Comfort Moves' was selected because the workout is presented as non-intense, home-based, and suitable for late evening to prepare for rest, indicating safe and feel-good movement. Audience comments about noticeable improvements and feeling stronger support the notion of comfort and gratification within the movement. A moderate score of 0.6 is suitable here.\n\n'Sleep Prep' is included because the routine is specifically designed for the evening, aiming to enhance restfulness without being overly exhausting, as inferred from the description (e.g., 'do this workout every night before you sleep'). However, the lack of explicit stress-reduction or meditative focus means it receives a lower score of 0.5.\n\nAlternate vibes like 'Zen Flow' or 'Meditative Grind' were considered but not used due to the absence of slow-paced, meditative focus or long repetitive movements typically associated with these vibes. Overall, the confidence level is high due to clear descriptions and consistent audience feedback."
