  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video focuses on post-workout stretching for injury prevention and flexibility, which typically involves simple and direct movements such as static holds and gentle muscle lengthening. This aligns with 'Beginner' technique difficulty as these exercises have minimal coordination or complexity. The description and tags highlight stretching, and comments suggest relaxation and ease, supporting the conclusion that no advanced techniques are required.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the low technique and effort difficulty, the primary required fitness level is 'Beginner'. This session is suited for complete novices or very deconditioned individuals. However, stretching is also beneficial for 'Intermediate' users, who can extend the exercises to enhance flexibility further. Some small consideration for 'Advanced' due to its beneficial nature post-exercise for more regular exercisers, especially those recovering from intense workouts, is included. The comment highlighting a dancer using it post-intensive choreo supports this wider applicability."
