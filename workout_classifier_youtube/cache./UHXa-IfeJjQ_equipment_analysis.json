  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled '70s HIIT Elliptical Workout | Elliptical Machine Class to 70s Pop | Fitscope Studio,' which explicitly indicates the primary equipment required is an elliptical machine. The description further emphasizes this by mentioning 'elliptical machine interval workout' and utilizing 'both resistance and inclines intervals.' The tags, such as 'Elliptical Machine,' 'elliptical workout,' and 'Ultimate Elliptical Workout,' reinforce the focus on the elliptical. Additionally, the comments indicate that participants are engaging in the workout using an elliptical, as one commenter notes having their heart rate up, which aligns with cardio workouts performed on this equipment. Therefore, with very high confidence, the equipment required is the elliptical."
