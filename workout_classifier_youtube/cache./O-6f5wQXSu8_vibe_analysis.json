  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled '10-Minute Meditation For Anxiety' strongly aligns with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe due to its focus on relieving anxiety through guided meditation, which can be a form of nervous system reset. The description and tags emphasize the meditative experience aimed at anxiety relief, featuring terms like 'healing meditation' and 'let go of anxiety', suggesting an ultra-gentle movement approach fitting the 'Deep Recharge' vibe. The channel's theme of promoting well-being further supports this classification. \n\nThe presence of mindfulness coaching and breath-centered guidance indicate elements of 'The Zen Flow,' although the core focus on anxiety relief aligns more with 'Deep Recharge.' Therefore, a secondary vibe of 'The Zen Flow' is relevant but with a slightly lower score due to less emphasis on traditional slow-flow or tai chi practices.\n\n'The Reboot Workout' also slightly aligns, focusing on refreshment, but the content more accurately fits 'Deep Recharge.' The comments reflect the calming impact, confirming the alignment. Therefore, these vibes are selected with a high confidence of 0.9 due to explicit indicators across metadata."
