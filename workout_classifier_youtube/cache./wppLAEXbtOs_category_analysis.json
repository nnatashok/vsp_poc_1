  "categoriesExplanation": "The video primarily focuses on a High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) routine. This is explicitly stated in the title '20 Min HIIT Full Body Workout At Home' and reinforced in the description with phrases like 'Full Body HIIT Workout', 'torch calories', and 'burn fat and build strength'. The tags also heavily emphasize 'hiit workout', 'hiit workout at home', and 'hiit workout no equipment', confirming this category as a core element of the workout (Score: 0.9).\n\n\"Body weight\" is another relevant category as the workout involves exercises like \"Air Squats\", \"Burpees\", and \"Mountain Climbers\", which are typical bodyweight exercises. The description and tags mention 'bodyweight', and the workout is 'no equipment', which implies reliance on body weight, justifying a secondary classification (Score: 0.6).\n\n\"Mat\" exercises are a minor aspect since the description mentions using a non-slip workout mat. Exercises like \"Plank\" and \"Superman\" involve mat work, but this is less central compared to the HIIT focus (Score: 0.3).\n\nThe assignment has a high confidence level (0.85) due to clear and consistent indicators across multiple metadata elements supporting the selected categories."
