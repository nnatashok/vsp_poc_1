  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The 4-7-8 breathing technique is very simple and requires minimal coordination or skill. The key action involves controlled breathing based on a simple count, making it accessible to those with minimal experience in meditation or breathing exercises. The description even suggests that users can take breaks if needed and adjust their breathing speed as long as the ratio (4-7-8) is maintained. This strongly aligns with a beginner level, but slight adjustments or individual breath control may slightly raise it to intermediate for those unfamiliar with breath control exercises.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort required is minimal, as the exercise primarily involves seated or stationary breathing exercises designed to relax the body and mind. Although the video duration is over 20 minutes, the nature of the exercise being low pace and calming ensures it doesn't significantly raise physical demands. A mention of potential lightheadedness when first practicing indicates some minor adjustment in breathing patterns, but overall energy expenditure remains very low, categorizing this as a light effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The breathing exercise is primarily accessible to beginners due to its simplicity and focus on relaxation rather than physical exertion. No prior fitness level is required, as users are encouraged to adapt the pace to their comfort level. The channel emphasizes simplicity and easing into meditation practices. While there is mention of some adaptation to deeper breathing for those used to shallow breathing, this only slightly aligns with intermediate levels, as most users, regardless of fitness level, can engage safely with minor adjustments."
