  "spiritsExplanation": "The video 'Instant Relaxation: 5-Minute Guided Breathwork for Nervous System Regulation' is strongly aligned with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as indicated by its focus on calming anxiety and stress relief through breathwork. The description emphasizes nervous system regulation and relaxation, supported by tags like 'anti anxiety meditation' and 'breathing exercises for anxiety'. These aspects justify a high score (0.95) for Soothing & Restorative.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit applies due to the channel's emphasis on rhythmic music and the smooth, guided format of the breathwork routine, which is described as easy and rhythmic. This aspect is reinforced by channel metadata highlighting music-driven pacing, suggesting a mind-body connection through guided breathwork. Therefore, the Flow & Rhythm spirit is given a score of 0.75.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the lack of indicators for intense effort, structured protocols, or athletic training. 'Outdoor & Adventure' is also irrelevant as the session is not nature-based."
