  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for the video explicitly identifies that the workout is a '20 MIN HIIT Treadmill Workout,' making the use of a treadmill central to the exercise routine. The description provides further evidence, outlining the workout structure with specific speeds and incline suggestions for the treadmill, confirming its necessity for the activity. Additionally, multiple tags such as 'treadmill follow along workout' and 'free treadmill workout' reinforce that a treadmill is required for this HIIT session. The confidence level is very high (1.0) due to the consistent and clear indications across the title, description, and tags."
