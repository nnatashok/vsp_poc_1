  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated as 'Beginner' due to the use of an elliptical machine, which requires minimal coordination and is generally straightforward. The video targets beginners explicitly, as seen in the title ('Beginner Elliptical Workout') and description. The workout involves basic speed and resistance adjustments, which are simple tasks on an elliptical. Despite the simplicity, the mention of maintaining good form and adjusting resistance slightly increases complexity, which is why a slight 'Intermediate' score is included.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as 'Moderate', primarily due to the 20-minute duration with alternating intervals of speed and resistance. The workout involves moderate energy expenditure suitable for beginners and includes several recovery periods. However, the structure of speed and resistance intervals pushes the boundary to a 'Challenging' level for very deconditioned users. Comments suggest participants found it both accessible and mildly challenging, supporting this classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout's required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner', based on its explicit targeting of newcomers in the metadata. Although the effort involved in speed and resistance intervals can be challenging for some deconditioned users, the contained structure and simplicity of use make it accessible for beginners, with a slight nod towards 'Intermediate' for those less accustomed to cardiovascular workouts. User comments highlight its suitability and accessibility, reinforcing this classification."
