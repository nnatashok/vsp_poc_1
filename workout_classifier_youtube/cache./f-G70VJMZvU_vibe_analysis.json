  "vibesExplanation": "The video is a 10-minute full-body stretch routine, explicitly targeting mobility and injury prevention, aligning well with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe. This vibe emphasizes deep stretch and low stress, highlighted by comments about the routine being accessible and atmospheric, even done \"in the rain\" which suggests a refreshing and rejuvenating experience. The use of terms like 'mobility,' 'injury prevention,' and 'recovery' reinforce this vibe, earning it a score of 0.8 due to the strong emphasis on these elements.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Foundation Builder' vibe is applicable as the workout focuses on strengthening weak points and enhancing flexibility, key components in rebuilding and perfecting basics, such as flexibility and injury prevention exercises. The video's aim to \"tend\" to the body post-exercise and comments about improving overall well-being support this classification, making it a strong fit with a score of 0.7.\n\nPotential vibes such as 'The Zen Flow' were considered but not selected as the focus is more on functional recovery rather than intentional, breath-centered movement typically associated with 'Zen Flow' workouts."
