  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The equipment required for this workout is a 'Mat', which is explicitly mentioned in the description as the necessary equipment: \"Equipment: Mat\". This implies a very high confidence level that a mat is central to the workout, particularly since the workout includes movements such as planks and crunches that benefit from a softer surface to support the body and protect the joints. The presence of exercises like 'Plank Pose', 'Plank Running', and 'Sit Up Crunches' further supports the need for a mat to ensure comfort and safety. User comments and the nature of the workout as a 'cardio mat fusion' also suggest that the floor-based nature of some exercises may make a mat highly suitable, aligning with the workout's goal of a low-impact yet challenging session."
