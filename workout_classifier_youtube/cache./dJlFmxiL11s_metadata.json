  "description": "Build your six-pack with this core workout from Ashley Conrad's Clutch Life Trainer.\n\u25ba BodyFit Training Programs: https://bbcom.me/2CS7qms\n\u25ba Shop Bodybuilding Signature Supplements: https://bbcom.me/3hHziIE\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:13 - Circuit 1, Round 1\n04:10 - Circuit 1, Round 2\n08:15 - Circuit 2, Round 1\n09:05 - Circuit 2, Round 2\n09:55 - Outro\n\nThe first day of the Clutch Life 24/7 Trainer introduces you to how you'll perform the workouts. We'll go through the dynamic warm-up, the stretch series, and the strength circuits together! That's seriously Clutch.\n\nYou can (and should) scale the workouts to fit your level, but you should never scale so much that you don't feel challenged. Every workout should feel difficult. Your heart should be racing and you should be sweating. Push yourself as much as you can. Rest when you must, but don't take more than a minute or two to catch your breath.\n\nThe Clutch Life Trainer doesn't end with these workouts. You need to carry the same willingness to work with you into your kitchen and everyday life. No, you don't have a super-specific diet to follow, but if you follow the flexible game plan I've laid out for you, you'll see fantastic results in your physique, performance, and overall health.\n\nThe Clutch Life is all about putting your best foot forward every single day.\n\n========================================\u00ad=====\n\n| Follow Us |\n\u25ba Twitch: http://bit.ly/2q1dttE\n\u25ba YouTube: http://bit.ly/1RSJFa4\n\u25ba Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1lomhpr\n\u25ba Instagram: http://bit.ly/1LzBxab\n\u25ba Twitter: http://bit.ly/1RSJQlL\n\u25ba Google+: http://bit.ly/1NRe8qu\n\u25ba Pinterest: http://bit.ly/1OOZgY4\n\u25ba Spotify: http://spoti.fi/1NRebm0\n \nWe are Bodybuilding.com.
