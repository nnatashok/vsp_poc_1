    "14 years ago, I hiked that trek with my two best friends. We hiked all over New Zealand, but this hike was the most memorable as we attempted to climb the mountain after the end and spent the night wild camping. I didn&#39;t realize I had chosen this path to run along on my treadmill, but 10 minutes in, I started to recognize the surroundings, and all the memories returned. Amazing video of such fantastic scenery. Thanks a lot!",
    "Thank you for the video! The view was amazing and the natural sounds of running made it perfect \ud83c\udf7a",
    "Awesome my Friend Although i Just on the spot Walk Along , i honestly believe these Videos are Saving My Life Thank You\ud83d\ude4f",

    "I find myself saying excuse me loudly and leaning into the curves. I am running on a Woodway Curve and am amazed at how I respond to visual cues - so pleased with these - thank you"
