  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout titled '15 Min Intense HIIT Workout For Fat Burn & Cardio (No Equipment, No Repeats)' explicitly states in both the title and description that no equipment is needed. The tags reinforce this by including terms like 'no equipment' and 'bodyweight workout,' indicating that exercises are performed using only one's body weight. Additionally, user comments support the notion of a challenging, accessible workout that requires no special equipment, making it suitable for home exercise routines. Therefore, this workout appears to be bodyweight only, and no specific equipment is required."
