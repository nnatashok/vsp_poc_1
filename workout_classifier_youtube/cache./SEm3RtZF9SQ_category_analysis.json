  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is titled '20-Minute \"Full Body\" Home Workout (Beginner to Expert!)' and is from a channel named Calisthenicmovement, which strongly suggests a focus on calisthenics. This is supported by the tags such as 'Calisthenics,' 'Bodyweight Exercises,' and 'Street Workout,' indicating a high confidence level (0.9) for the Calisthenics category. The description lacks specific exercise details, but user comments and tags mention exercises such as push-ups and rows, which are typically bodyweight exercises, justifying a strong score (0.8) for Body weight. The exercises seem to be structured as a circuit routine, which aligns with calisthenics principles. The inclusion of exercises like rows and jumping-squats also suggests a dynamic range possibly fitting outside typical bodyweight conventions, so a minor classification as 'Other' (score 0.4) captures any unconventional formats or practices. Other categories like Weight workout or Yoga are excluded due to the clear emphasis on bodyweight and calisthenics with no explicit mention or suggestion of weights or yoga practices in the workout."
