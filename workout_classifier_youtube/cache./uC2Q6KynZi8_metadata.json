    "Yoga always reminds me of how inflexible I am",
    "Your classes are the ultimate - I love how you break everything down and make them available to everyone. Thankyou so much &lt;3",
    "You have quickly become my favourite yoga teacher on YT. As a beginner I appreciate how many different asanas you incorporate into even your shorter sequences, I feel like I learn more in your classes. Thanks for putting out free yoga sessions \ud83d\udc9b",
    "Since being introduced to your classes by a friend,  i have not missed a day! I started about a month ago and couldn&#39;t even lie flat on the ground in the first class but have come on in leaps and bounds and am much more flexible in my whole body.  My pulse rate has also reduced from 99 to down to 75 bpm. Gosh,  what results.  I can&#39;t thank you enough and tell everyone about your channel. You are an amazing teacher and a real inspiration. Fabulous work I am truly grateful to you . Namaste x",
    "Started doing some of these everyday at 6am I\u2019m trying to be an early bird and this really helps me wake up! Thank you"
