  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is 'Meditation' with a score of 0.9. This choice is strongly supported by the title, \"15 MIN Guided Meditation For Manifestation & Success,\" and several mentions of meditation throughout the tags (e.g., 'guided meditation', 'success meditation') and description. The emphasis in the description on calming and focusing the mind to \"manifest success\" through a \"consistent meditation practice\" further confirms this. Comments from viewers also reiterate the meditative and mental health benefits experienced from this video, enhancing the confidence in this classification.\n\nAdditionally, 'Breathing exercises' is marked with a lower score of 0.3. Although not explicitly mentioned, breathing typically plays a role in meditation practices, especially those involving mindfulness and focus. This inference is backed by the channel's focus on mindful living. However, due to the lack of direct mention, the confidence and score for 'Breathing exercises' remain low.\n\nThe video does not fit categories like Yoga, despite the channel's name and related offerings, as the specifics and focus remain on meditation."
