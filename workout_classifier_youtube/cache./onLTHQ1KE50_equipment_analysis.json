  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout clearly requires dumbbells, as indicated in both the title and the description. The title states 'With Dumbbells' and the description specifies that a 'medium set of dumbbells' is needed for the workout. The tags further reinforce this requirement with phrases like 'upper body workout with dumbbells' and 'arm workout with dumbbells'. This consistent emphasis throughout the metadata justifies a very high confidence score of 1.0 for the necessity of dumbbells in this workout. There is no mention of any other equipment, making it clear that dumbbells are central to the routine."
