  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a guided meditation that focuses on relaxation and mental well-being rather than physical movements. Guided meditations are inherently easy to follow as they involve passive listening rather than complex motor skills or physical tasks. The metadata repeatedly highlights terms like 'guided meditation', 'sleep', and 'relaxation', indicating straightforward, non-physical engagement. Thus, it fits squarely in the 'Beginner' category with a very high confidence (1.0).",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 1.0,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as 'Light' since meditation involves minimal physical exertion, focusing instead on mental relaxation. The duration is 20 minutes, appropriate for a meditation session. The video's purpose, as described, is to induce a state of calm and relaxation, necessitating very low energy output. Keywords such as 'peace', 'restful sleep', and 'calming music' further validate this classification. The activity level required for participation is minimal, making the 'Light' classification definitive.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Due to its nature as a guided meditation, the required fitness level is rated as 'Beginner'. Meditation does not require prior physical fitness experience, and therefore is accessible to users at all levels. Additionally, intermediate and advanced levels are included with slightly lower scores due to mindfulness and meditation practices often being part of a broader routine for more active individuals. The description and comments suggest universal accessibility, which supports these multiple fitness level inclusions."
