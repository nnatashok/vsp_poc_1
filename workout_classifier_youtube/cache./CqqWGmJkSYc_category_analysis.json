  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is clearly focused on calisthenics, as indicated by the title \"The Best Workout Routine to Start Calisthenics for Beginners,\" and reinforced by the tags such as \"calisthenics,\" \"beginner calisthenics routine,\" and \"calisthenics workout routine.\" The description emphasizes learning calisthenics skills and includes references to exercises like handstands and muscle-ups, which are characteristic of calisthenics. The channel, CALISTHENICS FAMILY, specializes in calisthenics content, further supporting this classification. Therefore, 'Calisthenics' is assigned a score of 1.0 due to strong evidence. \n\n'Body weight' is also relevant since the routines involve exercises like diamond push-ups, pull-up holds, and pistol squats, which use the body's own weight for resistance, common in calisthenics. This category is assigned a score of 0.7 because the exercises largely overlap with calisthenics but are distinct enough to warrant inclusion."
