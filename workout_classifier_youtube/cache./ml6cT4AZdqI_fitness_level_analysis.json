  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes movements like high-knees, fast feet, star jumps, jumping lunges, and planks. High-knees and fast feet are beginner-friendly in terms of coordination, but jumping lunges and star jumps require more coordination and balance, making them intermediate in technique. The overall set of exercises leans towards Intermediate, considering the mix of simple and more complex bodyweight movements. However, since no equipment is needed, it's accessible at a basic level as well.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This 30-minute HIIT workout is designed to spike heart rates and includes high-intensity exercises like jumping lunges and fast feet. The description highlights this as a 'high intensity cardio workout,' and the duration of nearly 29 minutes supports a 'Challenging' rating for effort.

There's a moderate-to-high energy expenditure due to the cardio focus and minimal rest, placing it firmly in the Challenging category.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique ranges from beginner to intermediate, but the effort level is solidly Challenging due to the HIIT format and the 30-minute duration. Intermediate users will find this push at the high end of their capability, while advanced users will find it a good moderate session. The absence of equipment means anyone can try, yet the level of intensity and specific exercises like jumping lunges make it more suited to those with some exercise background."
