  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.8 due to its focus on smooth, continuous movement patterns typical of Pilates. The title mentions 'hourglass pilates', indicating a workout driven by form and flow. Comments highlight the workout's calming nature and emphasize controlled, mindful movements, which align well with this spirit. Additionally, the description's mention of doing the workout outside suggests an integration of a rhythmic, flowing connection with the environment.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant, scored at 0.6. While it's a beginner-friendly full-body workout designed for efficiency, comments describe the workout as calm and suggest breathing techniques, implying a gentle approach that emphasizes relaxation and stress reduction. The short duration indicates a focus on making the routine accessible and less physically demanding, fitting the restorative spirit.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' is not suitable as there is no indication of high intensity or an aggressive pace. 'Structured & Disciplined' doesn't fit as there is no mention of strict protocols or technical focus. 'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are also disregarded due to the indoor, Pilates-centric nature of the workout."
