  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled \"15-minute POST-WORKOUT STRETCH for Injury Prevention & Flexibility,\" which strongly indicates a focus on stretching exercises, commonly performed as bodyweight movements without requiring additional equipment. The description emphasizes a full-body stretch to decompress and relieve tight muscles, with no mention of using any equipment. The comments do not reference any equipment, focusing instead on the stretching experience and personal anecdotes, further supporting that only bodyweight is used. Typically, a mat might be expected for comfort on the floor during stretching routines, but there is no explicit mention of a mat in the title, description, or comments, leading to a determination that no specific equipment is required for this workout. Therefore, this appears to be a bodyweight-only workout and no equipment from the provided options is needed."
