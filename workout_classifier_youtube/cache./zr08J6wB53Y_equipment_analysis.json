  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout in question is explicitly described as a 'No Equipment' high-intensity interval training (HIIT) routine. This is directly indicated in both the title, which states 'No Equipment,' and reiterated in the video description. Furthermore, the tags include 'no equipment,' 'bodyweight,' and 'keine gewichte' (no weights), affirming the bodyweight-only nature of the exercises. The description also emphasizes that the routine is filled with basic movements, suggesting exercises like planks and dolphin holds that typically don't require any equipment. The lack of any mention or implication of equipment in both the tags and user comments supports the classification of this workout as bodyweight only, justifying a confidence score of 0 for all equipment options."
