  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata of this video strongly suggests a 'Structured & Disciplined' workout spirit, as it involves a methodical approach with specific exercises, repetitions, and rounds outlined, indicating a focus on technical form and progression for beginners. The description and workout listing emphasize creating a foundation for more advanced exercises, a hallmark of structured training. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is scored at 0.85 due to the explicit detailing of the routine.\n\nMeanwhile, 'Flow & Rhythm' captures some aspects of this workout, particularly as it's a follow-along routine meant to guide users smoothly through exercises. Though primarily structured, these follow-along practices often incorporate rhythm and continuity to enhance the experience, warranting a secondary score of 0.65. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the workout's beginner-friendly, non-intense focus and lack of emphasis on relaxation or recovery."
