  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified under 'Mat' and 'Body weight' categories due to several strong indicators: \n\n1. **Mat (Score: 0.8):** The workout is a full-body exercise routine intended for beginners and requires no equipment, as indicated in both the title \"20 Min FULL BODY Workout For BEGINNERS (No Equipment)\" and description. While there's a mention of a workout mat in the description, it's used merely for comfort rather than functionality, reinforcing the mat-based nature of the activities. \n\n2. **Body weight (Score: 0.8):** The video emphasizes a 'no equipment' approach, utilizing body weight for exercises, as detailed in the description: \"with just your body weight, a few simple exercises\" and reiterated in the tags \"beginner workout no equipment\" and \"no equipment beginner workout\". This approach is central to the workout's structure.\n\nThe confidence level in these classifications is quite high (0.9), due to explicit mentions of exercise type and format across the title, description, and tags, with user comments supporting the transformative and accessible nature of the workout. No other categories such as 'Weight workout' or 'Pilates' were considered due to the clear absence of equipment and specific movement styles associated with those categories."
