  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "I have been doing this routine 3 days a week for just over a month and my core is getting so strong. I can do core exercises like a pro.  Already noticed toned arms, toned sides around core,  toned legs and bum,    I can&#39;t believe how much i can bend and how flexible I&#39;m becoming.  Pilates is my new obsession.. :) \u2764\u2764",
    "when you said &quot;in my new home in thailand&quot; i BAWLED! you are so humble, hard working and passionate! truly beautiful inside and out &lt;3 you have improved the lives of millions of people! you deserve all the success you achieved! much more to come!!!",
    "I&#39;m a 36 year old man. After years of abusing my body lifting weights I have been having a lot of bodily pains and mobility problems. I tried this for the first time today in an attempt to recondition my decrepit body and geeze leweze this was way harder than I thought it would be. 26 minutes in I succumbed to my fatigue. <br><br>I will continue to try this 2 or 3 times a week and hopefully I&#39;ll make improvements.<br><br>Thank you Nicole! Your guidance has been amazing and very helpful. You look so amazing and graceful when you do it.",
    "My favorite sentence: Let&#39;s finish class.... It makes me feel that i made it one more time. I stayed committed and didn&#39;t give up. So when i hear &quot;Let&#39;s finish class..&quot; i do it with a huge sweaty smile in my heart. Thank you Nicole for being who you are and helping us become our best version in mind and body. Light and love to you and all \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe",
    "Pilates is always so much harder than I think it&#39;s gonna be and that&#39;s super humbling. Thank you for another great class!"
