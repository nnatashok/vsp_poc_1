  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.8. This is indicated by the focus on a 'beginner vinyasa flow sequence' as mentioned in the title and description, highlighting smooth, continuous movement patterns that are characteristic of flow and coordination. The use of 'strength & flexibility' in the title implies a balanced approach with attention to detail in movement, confirmed by comments that appreciate the incorporation of different asanas and progress in flexibility.\n\nAdditionally, 'Soothing & Restorative' is assigned a score of 0.6 due to the emphasis on a slower pace suitable for beginners ('something slower paced that still hits all the marks'), as well as the gradual movement into and out of poses which aids in stress reduction and foundational strength. This is further supported by user comments reflecting personal growth and increased flexibility, suggesting a calming and restorative impact.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility', were excluded due to the gentle and accessible nature of the class, which caters to beginners without high-intensity or sports-specific elements."
