  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.8. This categorization is supported by the video's emphasis on unwinding, stretching, and being suitable for all fitness levels. Phrasing such as 'decrease stress and relieve sore and achy muscles' in the description, along with tags like 'Relaxing workout' and 'Stress free yoga,' explicitly suggest this energy. \n\nLikewise, 'Flow & Rhythm' captures a secondary aspect of the workout with a score of 0.6, as comments praise the flow and the importance of breath ('remember to breathe'), as well as the use of calming piano music which sets a rhythmic tone ('lovely piano music set a wonderful tone').\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' interplays with 'Structured & Disciplined', which is reflected in the methodical routine needed to stretch all muscles effectively, earning it a 0.4 score. However, this structured approach is more about providing clarity for beginners and seniors, rather than focusing on intense precision or progression.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to the gentle and home-based nature of this workout aimed at relaxation, not pushing physical limits or sports training."
