  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, as evidenced by the use of the term 'HIIT' (High-Intensity Interval Training) in the title and throughout the description. This type of training is known for its fast-paced nature that aims to raise heart rates and burn more calories, as indicated by the sections on jogging and sprinting intervals at increasing resistances. The phrase 'burning beginner HIIT workout' suggests a focus on pushing beginner limits, thereby supporting a high-energy categorization, with a score of 0.7.\n\nA 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is also present, demonstrated by the detailed breakdown of workout intervals and resistance levels, which show a methodical approach to training. The inclusion of pointers for posture, core engagement, and progression through resistance levels adds a level of discipline and structure, earning a score of 0.6. However, the workout is for beginners, slightly softening the intensity and structure typically present in more advanced routines. \n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are less applicable due to the emphasis on intensity and structured progress rather than continuous smooth movement or relaxation."
