  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes basic push-ups, which are beginner-friendly, but it also involves techniques like the 90\u00b0 isometric hold and push-ups in a circle, which require significant core stability and upper body strength, aligning with an intermediate to advanced technique difficulty. The user comments describing difficulty and inability to perform some exercises suggest the challenging nature of the workout for those with less experience.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is relatively short (12 minutes), but the inclusion of intense exercises like a 90\u00b0 hold increases the effort required, making it challenging for less fit individuals. The combination of different push-up variations and isometric holds suggests a higher energy expenditure, making the workout moderately challenging for deconditioned users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Due to the inclusion of advanced exercises like the 90\u00b0 hold and the overall feedback in the comments, the workout seems to target more experienced exercisers. However, given the manageable duration and the possibility for modifying exercises, intermediate users could also engage with it, albeit with modifications. The quick transition and complexity of activities make it less suitable for beginners."
