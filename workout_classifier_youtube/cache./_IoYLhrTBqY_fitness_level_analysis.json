  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The routine primarily focuses on basic full-body stretching exercises meant for flexibility and mobility enhancement, which are typically simple to perform. The metadata emphasizes ease and 'step up my stretching skills' which implies approachable difficulty. Comments from users like 'cries in broomstick flexibility' suggest some may find initial stretches challenging, bringing a slight push toward Intermediate. However, the explicit inclusion of 'beginner' in the tags and overall simplicity pointed out supports a strong Beginner level classification.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is specifically described as a stretching routine, which inherently demands low energy expenditure and focuses on increasing flexibility rather than physical intensity. The metadata suggests a routine designed for daily and gentle practice ('just prepare a soft surface') which confirms a Light effort difficulty classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the light effort and beginner technique difficulty, the workout is highly suitable for beginners, aligning with tags and thematic accessibility ('beginner,' 'leicht,' 'easy'). The inclusion of some intermediate potential is due to the comments highlighting perceived challenges related to flexibility, indicating participants with a bit more experience in stretching might also benefit. The video's main focus on flexibility, which many beginners may have neglected, slightly elevates the fitness level inclusion toward Intermediate."
