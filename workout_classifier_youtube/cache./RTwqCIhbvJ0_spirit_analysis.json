  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, scored at 0.6, due to its focus on low-impact exercises suitable for those with knee or lower body issues, as highlighted in the title and description ('No Jumping,' 'workout for knee problem'). It ensures minimal stress on joints, promoting recovery and gentle fitness. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present, scored 0.6, as the workout consists of a sequence of exercises that do not require abrupt movements, fostering a continuous and balanced routine. This is suggested by the inclusion of exercises like 'knee raises,' 'arm circles,' and 'leg kicks,' which can be performed in a rhythmic manner. Finally, the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is relevant with a score of 0.6, as the video suggests performing the routine regularly and outlines a clear sequence of exercises in the comments ('30 knee raises', '30 lateral arm circles'). There is a moderate confidence level (0.7) due to the workout's emphasis on predictable and safe movements rather than high-intensity or outdoor elements, thus excluding other potential spirits."
