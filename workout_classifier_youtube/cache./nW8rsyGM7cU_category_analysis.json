  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified under \"Indoor biking\" with very high confidence and a score of 1.0, as evidenced by both the title and channel description explicitly referring to rhythm cycling and dance rides. Terms like \"Rhythm Cycling Class\" and comments from viewers mentioning static bicycles and cycling experiences strongly indicate that this is a stationary cycling workout. The channel's focus on \"THE ULTIMATE RHYTHM CYCLING EXPERIENCE\" provides further strong support for the classification as an indoor biking session. There is no indication in the metadata of any other workout type being involved, thus no other categories were relevant."
