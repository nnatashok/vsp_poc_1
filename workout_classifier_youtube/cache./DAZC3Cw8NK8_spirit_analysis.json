  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under **Flow & Rhythm** with a score of 0.75 due to the emphasis on 'fluid' movement, as indicated in the title '21-MIN FLUID WORKOUT'. This suggests a focus on smooth, continuous movements which is supported by positive user comments about the \"flow\" of the routine and a lack of disruptive elements like jumps. The repeated mention of it being fun and easy further aligns it with a rhythmic and engaging style.\n\nThe **Structured & Disciplined** spirit follows closely with a score of 0.65 due to the clear structure presented in the video, with detailed timecodes and specific exercises laid out in a sequence. The fact that exercises are repeated daily with progressive goals described by users also supports this categorization, highlighting methodical routine adherence.\n\nFinally, a mild presence of **Soothing & Restorative** is detected with a score of 0.4. The mention of 'no jumping', combined with exercises like 'Cat And Cow', 'Cobra', and 'Baby Pose', indicates elements of relaxation and gentle movement. However, the primary focus remains on weight loss and fluid movement, which takes precedence over restoration.\n\nOverall, the classification is confident with clear indicators supporting the primary spirits chosen, while others, like **High-Energy & Intense**, are excluded due to the lack of high-intensity elements."
