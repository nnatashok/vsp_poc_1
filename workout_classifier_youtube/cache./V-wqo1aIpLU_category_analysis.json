  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is predominantly a 'Weight workout' as indicated by numerous mentions of using dumbbells (ranging from 10lbs to 25lbs) throughout the workout. The title and description emphasize 'Strength Training' and 'full body supersets,' both of which denote the use of weights to build muscle. This is corroborated by the detailed exercise list, including exercises like 'Chest Press,' 'Renegade Row,' and 'Goblet Squat,' which traditionally involve weights. The comments also reflect that this workout focuses on strengthening muscles, with positive feedback about the impact on arms, shoulders, and legs. 'Body weight' is a secondary category due to the involvement of exercises like 'Single Leg Glute Bridge' and 'Crunches,' which can be performed without weights, although in this context they might incorporate weights for resistance. The high confidence in 'Weight workout' classification is supported by the explicit mention of dumbbells as necessary equipment and the overall focus on muscle hypertrophy, achieving a perfect score of 1.0 in that category."
