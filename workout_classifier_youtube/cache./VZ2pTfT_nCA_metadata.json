Here are 5 steps that will get rid of your belly fat: \n\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3Increase Your Daily Physical Activity: Intensive cardio exercises such as running, cycling, and swimming can help burn calories and reduce body fat, including belly fat.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3Focus on a Healthy Diet: Consuming a balanced diet that includes foods high in protein, fiber, and healthy fats can help reduce belly fat. A diet low in processed and sugary foods is also effective.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3Incorporate Strength Training: Resistance or strength training helps build muscle, which is metabolically active and burns more calories, even at rest.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3Reduce Stress Levels: High levels of stress can cause an increase in cortisol, which can contribute to the buildup of belly fat.

    "I\u2019m a 50 yr old man,  I\u2019ve done this work out for 5 days at 5am (best time to workout by the way-on an empty stomach for quicker results). Results: lost 5lbs - 1 or 2 cups of coffee (light creamer) in the AM, any meal at noon, and a hearty salad in the evening (6pm) with carrots and almonds to feel full. I need to have the crunch! Going to continue the routine Saturday and Sunday. No cheat days and no breaks until I reach my goal of 180lbs. Currently at 210lbs. Hope this helps anyone. Establish a routine is key!",
    "After 3 kids I was able to always get back in shape but getting in a car accident and having to undergo multiple surgeries at the same time losing my mother got me in the worst shape ever been in gaining 50 pounds but for the last 6 months through diet I was able to lose 40 pounds and have been watching your videos for the last month to help with toning the rest and building muscle which were severely weak also the mom pouch that is getting smaller every time I do your workouts. Started off small with your vids and now moving up some. I am seeing an amazing difference in my body already and feel like I am starting to look even better than before having children. These exercises are effective and are gentle enough to be able to do. I watch multiple videos of yours to improve on different and problem areas and have some memorized now but keep coming back for the encouraging motivation and patience you provide in your videos. It helps so much and is the exact help so many women have needed for so long. Thank you.",
    "I\u2019ve been working out with you (almost) everyday, steadily, since 6 Nov, and have lost 9 kilograms\u2026 I actually start with a 10 min HIT workout, followed by your 10 minutes of chair workout\u2026. It works, and discipline/resolve are the key for this 60 years old guy to get back his mojo. Thanks again! Drew",
