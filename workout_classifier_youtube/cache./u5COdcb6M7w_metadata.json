    "I&#39;m loving these workouts!! Why anyone would waste money on Pelaton is beyond me! Keep fit stay happy",
    "Dr., I am finding that this type of exercise is proving to be the best for my bad knee. I just made it through my first week with this video and am looking forward to using it every week. Thank you.",
    "My favorite workout so far! Doing this (along with lifting weights) 3x a week &amp; I feel so good! You are so appreciated Dr. Kevin!\ud83d\ude0a",
    "This bike was really easy to assemble <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxMesz3KOGEmwmvyKQfLfrRSUXLFzfVHZA\">https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxMesz3KOGEmwmvyKQfLfrRSUXLFzfVHZA</a> and required very few adjustments out of the box. The wheels did not require any truing/adjustments. The frame had some small scratches, but nothing major.I did replace the seat though - the seat it came with was very uncomfortable. The tires need to be re-inflated every 4-5 days, but this appears to be quite common for the narrow 700x25 tires.Overall, in my opinion, this bike looks and rides like a much more expensive bike."
