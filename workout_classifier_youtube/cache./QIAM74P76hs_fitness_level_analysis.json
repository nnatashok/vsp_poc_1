  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout uses an elliptical machine, which generally involves straightforward, low-impact movements suitable for most fitness levels, indicating a Beginner level technique difficulty. However, the use of varying resistance and incline suggests some Intermediate complexity, as users must adjust these and maintain coordination with increased intensity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This is a 29-minute workout on an elliptical machine with a 'rolling hills' format involving resistance and incline adjustments, suggesting a Moderate level effort due to the sustained cardiovascular engagement and muscle endurance required. However, as it's described as low impact, some segments may be Light in effort difficulty. The 5-minute warmup, 23-minute interval, and 2-minute cooldown structure supports this Moderate classification, with the duration influencing the level of energy expenditure.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique difficulty is accessible to Beginners due to the simplicity of elliptical movements. However, the nearly 30-minute duration and engagement of resistance/incline adjustments suggest the workout is more appropriately labelled for Intermediate users. Advanced users may find value given the incline and resistance variability typical of 'rolling hills', which can provide a challenge with increased effort. With indications of modification options from the instructor and inclusion in a variety of level-targeted fitscope classes, all levels up to Advanced could be included."
