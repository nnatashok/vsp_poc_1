  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is heavily indicated by the workout being divided into four groups to target different muscle groups, as mentioned in the description. This reflects a methodical and progressive approach to training, which is also supported by the channel's focus on structured workout sessions, earning it a high score of 0.9.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is also relevant but to a lesser degree. The presence of 'strength training' in both the title and tags, the emphasis on using challenging weights, and user comments describing the workout as a 'bit of a challenge' and pushing them 'out of comfort zones' suggest a high-intensity aspect deserving a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nThe other spirits don't match as strongly: 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' elements are absent, as this workout is strength-focused without a notable emphasis on smooth continuous movement or relaxation. No outdoor or sports-specific features are mentioned, excluding 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Sport & Agility' spirits."
