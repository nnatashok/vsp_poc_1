  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'The Warrior Workout' due to its high-intensity interval training (HIIT) nature, as indicated by the title 'PERFECT 15 MINUTE FAT MELTING HIIT CARDIO WORKOUT' and supported by tags like 'high-intensity interval training', 'calorie burning', and 'fat burning'. The description emphasizes a full-body challenge that 'will target all major muscle groups' and involve 'burning calories and melting away fat,' closely aligning with the sweat-dripping, heart-pounding energy of this vibe. User comments reinforce this intensity, with mentions of exercises like 'jumping lunges' making legs 'scream'.\n\nThe secondary vibe, 'The Firestarter', is scored at 0.6 because the workout is fast-paced and designed to be intense and quick, appealing to those looking for explosive exercise sessions. The workout's short duration and emphasis on calorie and fat burning hint at this vibe, although the primary focus remains on the broader, full-body challenge of 'The Warrior Workout'.\n\nThe 'Warrior Workout' dominates due to the explicit focus on intensity and full-body impact, as highlighted in the metadata."
