  "vibesExplanation": "The video, titled '10 MIN LOVE HANDLES AND LOWER BELLY FAT WORKOUT Standing Only | No Equipment!', strongly suggests 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe due to its emphasis on feel-good, accessible movement aimed at improving mood and energy ('standing only', 'no equipment'). The description promises a transformative experience through regular, moderate intensity workouts. The substantial view and like counts, along with user comments reporting progress and satisfaction, also emphasize a feel-good, endorphin-boosting quality, leading to a score of 0.7.\n\nBecause the workout encourages daily repetition with 'amazing results,' it aligns somewhat with 'The Progression Quest' vibe focusing on steady improvement, justifying a score of 0.6. Regular practice for incremental improvements aligns with comments and the recommendation to follow the routine daily for two weeks.\n\nAdditionally, due to the workout being pregnancy and postpartum friendly, it partially fits 'The Comfort Moves' vibe, catering to users seeking safe, gentle physical activity. The non-strenuous, adaptable nature of the exercises aligns with this vibe, scoring 0.5. While some elements could suggest 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Zen Flow,' the lack of focus on calm or zen qualities in the description and user feedback made these less appropriate."
