  "title": "Treadmill Climbing Workout  - Scenic Virtual Stair Climb of Chimney Rock in the Blue Ridge Mountains",
  "description": "This treadmill climbing workout is perfect short runs or walks on an incline. It's a 15 minute climb up and back down North Carolina's Chimney Rock in Blue Ridge Mountains. There are 500 winding stair steps to the top of this huge monolithic Chimney Rock. From there dig deep and head up couple hundred more stairs to reach the top of Exclamation Point.  It's a clear beautiful day, so take in views of up to 75 miles.  When I reached the top my legs were on fire, but you can make this climb as hard as you like or just take this scenic tour from the comfort of your favorite chair. ;-)",

  "channelDescription": "Walk, run or even bike to a variety of virtual running videos for treadmill users. Treadmill scenery includes beaches, parks and streets in and around amazing places like New York City, Miami, New Orleans and Washington DC.  It's almost like being there.  Well that's not really true, but it's definitely cheaper than actually going and if you tell your friends that you've crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, it's technically not a lie if you've watched the video of me doing it.  Indoor walking and running scenery is the perfect motivation for your at home workouts!",
