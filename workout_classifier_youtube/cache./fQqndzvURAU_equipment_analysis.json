  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title '15 Minute Beginner Indoor Cycling Session' explicitly mentions 'Indoor Cycling,' indicating the use of an Exercise bike. The description further supports this by referring to 'beginner cyclists looking to start training indoors.' This is corroborated by tags such as 'cycling,' 'spin class,' 'spinning,' 'indoor cycling,' and user comments referencing an 'indoor bike.' The channel description also mentions 'HIIT workouts on the bike,' further emphasizing the central role of the Exercise bike in this workout. Therefore, the confidence score for the Exercise bike is very high at 0.9, as it is essential and explicitly required for the session."
