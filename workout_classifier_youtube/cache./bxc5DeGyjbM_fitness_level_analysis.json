  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is primarily Beginner to Intermediate. The video promotes basic strength training using dumbbells, which inherently requires some coordination but remains accessible due to the beginner-friendly nature of the exercises mentioned and audio cues provided for correct form. The tags and description highlight the workout as suitable for 'beginner dumbbell workout.' Additionally, user comments indicate successful participation by older and newer users, reinforcing the Beginner to Intermediate level.",

  ],
  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.75,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is likely Moderate due to the 30-minute duration and the use of dumbbells which can be adjusted for weight. The video appears to be aimed at building strength tone rather than high-intensity intervals, as suggested by the lack of 'intense' or 'high-burn' keywords and focus on exercise form. Comments from users describing progression to heavier weights and longer duration further support the moderate intensity classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the moderate technique and effort difficulties, the required fitness level spans Beginner to Advanced due to the adjustable nature of dumbbells allowing users to increase weight as they progress. The Beginner and Intermediate levels are strongly supported by the video runtime (slightly above 30 minutes) and user feedback noting progression in their strength journey. The Advanced level is included at a lower score because more experienced users could still benefit from scaling weight and enhancing exercise execution, despite the workout's intended inclusivity. This wide range ensures inclusivity of varying user capabilities."
