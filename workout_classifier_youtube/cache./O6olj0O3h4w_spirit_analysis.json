  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata indicates a mix of 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' workout spirits. The title, '15 Minute Gentle BEGINNERS HIIT Workout', suggests a high-energy format (HIIT) but tailored towards beginners, lowering overall intensity. The structured nature is evident with mentions of '15 moves | 30 seconds work | 30 seconds rest', indicating a methodical and disciplined sequence, earning a high confidence of 0.8 for 'Structured & Disciplined'. Furthermore, Joe Wicks and The Body Coach brand are known for structured fitness programs, supporting this classification. The presence of \"gentle\" in the title and user comments about being suitable for beginners reduce the intensity score slightly but confirm the energy focus, assigning it a score of 0.6 for 'High-Energy & Intense'. Other spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' are not applicable here as the focus is on structured HIIT movement rather than flow or relaxation."
