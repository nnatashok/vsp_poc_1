  "vibesExplanation": "The workout's title and description heavily suggest a calming and energizing experience, ideal for morning practice. The title \"15 MIN MORNING YOGA FLOW || Wake Up & Feel Energised\" and the description highlight the aim to start the day with balance and energy, indicating a focus on smooth transitions and breath-centered movements typical of 'The Zen Flow.' This is reinforced by tags like \"morning yoga flow\" and \"vinyasa yoga morning flow,\" which are associated with intentional, grounding practices.\n\nAdditionally, the description notes feeling \"balanced, energised,\" suggesting elements of 'The Reboot Workout,' focusing on low-stress, total-body refreshment. The recurring emphasis on morning routine and user comments about mood enhancement post-practice support this classification. Users report feeling ready for the day and describe the workout as therapeutic, aligning with the vibe of refreshment and gentle awakening.\n\nThe choice of high confidence stems from explicit cues in metadata and the pervasive user feedback supporting these outcomes. Other potential vibes like 'The Groove Session' or 'The Endorphin Wave' were not considered due to a lack of emphasis on expressive or intense movements in the metadata."
