  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video by Lidia Mera strongly aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe due to numerous references to mindfulness, breathing, and a calming experience, as emphasized by top comments highlighting its calming effect and focus on breath-centered movement. The inclusion of verbal cues and lack of loud music further support this classification, with a high score of 0.8 indicating a strong match.\n\nThe video also fits the 'Masterclass Workout' vibe because it prioritizes technique and skill-building through verbal instructions, as noted in user comments praising the instructional quality that improves form, suggesting a score of 0.7.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Reboot Workout' vibe is applicable at a score of 0.6 due to the workout's calming and anxiety-reducing qualities, combined with its capability to refresh and reset the body, as expressed by users who felt a mental and physical transition through the session.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Comfort Moves' were less suitable due to the focus on Pilates-specific skill development and the workout's refreshing nature rather than purely repetitive or comfort-focused exercises."
