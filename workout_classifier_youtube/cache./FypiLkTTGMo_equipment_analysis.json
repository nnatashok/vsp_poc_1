Guided meditation typically involves listening and focusing without the need for physical equipment. The tags such as \"guided meditation,\" \"mindfulness meditation,\" and \"breathing meditation\" further support that this is a meditation practice, not a physical workout that requires equipment. The description emphasizes cultivating calm, ease, and joy, indicative of a meditative experience rather than a workout. Comments express gratitude and appreciation for the teaching and its effects, reinforcing the meditation context. There is no mention of physical exercises or any equipment like mats or props in the title, description, tags, or comments.
