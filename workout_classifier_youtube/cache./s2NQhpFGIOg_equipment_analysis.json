  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '15 Min Daily Yoga Routine for Beginners (Follow Along)' is a beginner-friendly yoga session that does not explicitly mention or suggest the need for any equipment. It focuses on various yoga postures and pranayama (breathing exercises) which are typically practiced without additional equipment. \n\nThe description mentions several specific yoga poses like Suryanamaskar, Pawanmuktasana, Markatasana, and Naukaasana, along with breathing exercises like Kapalbhati and Anulom Vilom, which are all traditionally done on a mat. However, since there is no explicit mention of a mat in the title, description, tags, or comments, and considering the general practice of yoga, a mat might be considered more of a comfort rather than a necessity. Given this information, the confidence level for needing a mat is low, so it has not been included in the required equipment.\n\nOverall, the video appears designed for home practice without requiring any specific equipment, thus no equipment is classified as needed with a confidence score above 0."
