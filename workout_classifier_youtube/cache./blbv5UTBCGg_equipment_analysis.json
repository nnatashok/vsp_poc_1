  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"Daily Guided Pranayama for Inner Balance | 10 mins | Beginner Level\" is a guided pranayama session focusing on breathing techniques for relaxation, inner peace, and stress relief. None of the video metadata, including the title, description, and tags, mentions the need for any physical workout equipment. Pranayama is generally focused on breath control and does not require any props or tools, suggesting the workout can be performed without equipment, likely in a seated or standing position appropriate for meditation or breathing exercises. Therefore, this workout appears to be bodyweight only, involving no additional equipment."
