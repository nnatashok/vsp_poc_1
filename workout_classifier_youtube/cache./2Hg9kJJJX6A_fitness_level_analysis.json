  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This workout involves basic treadmill walking, which is a straightforward movement requiring minimal coordination or balance, classifying it predominantly at a 'Beginner' level. The inclusion of HIIT elements, though low impact, might suggest a slight increase in complexity, justifying a minor 'Intermediate' score.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short 10-minute session focusing on power walking with HIIT elements. The description highlights 'low impact HIIT cardio', indicating the physical demand is primarily light but could range to moderate due to the use of power intervals. The brief duration and rests between sets reduce the overall intensity, keeping the effort mainly in the 'Light' category with a moderate aspect due to the power walking and swift pace.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the basic nature of treadmill walking, the target demographic of beginners, and explicit mentions in both the tags and description, the workout is clearly accessible to beginners. The inclusion of low impact HIIT suggests some minimal interval training experience could be beneficial, thus accounting for a secondary 'Intermediate' designation. The technique and effort difficulties mainly fall within the beginner scope, with a bit of range coverage into intermediate due to the HIIT component."
