  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Breathing exercises' with high confidence (score of 0.9) due to explicit mentions of 'guided breathing' and 'guided breathwork' both in the title and tags. The description highlights a 15-day breathwork course, emphasizing the focus on breathing techniques. The comments further reinforce this classification with users discussing the breathwork method and its impact, indicating a central role of breathing techniques in this video.\n\n'Meditation' is the secondary classification (score of 0.5) with moderate evidence. The title suggests stress reduction and happiness, which are common meditation outcomes. Additionally, the top commenter requests a 'guided breathing meditation' and highlights the video's calming influence, aligning it with meditation practices. This suggests a possible dual focus, though not as explicitly emphasized as breathing exercises. The content does not strongly indicate other categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Stretching,' as there is no specific mention of physical postures or movement."
