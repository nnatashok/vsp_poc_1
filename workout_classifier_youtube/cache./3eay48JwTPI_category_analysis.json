  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is best classified under 'Mat' due to the explicit mention in the metadata of being a 'lazy girl' and 'apartment friendly' workout with 'no jumping', indicating floor-based exercises that are suitable for confined spaces, typically performed on a mat. This classification aligns with the video being described as doable in an apartment, with low impact and intensity, which is a hallmark of mat-based exercises. \n\nAdditionally, the 'Body weight' category is relevant as the description and tags suggest exercises to be done without equipment. Terms like 'full body workout', 'low impact', and the emphasis on being able to perform it 'in bed' or on the floor without needing additional equipment imply the use of body weight as resistance. \n\nThe confidence level is quite high due to the specificity in the description and tags, and the clear marketing as a workout that can be done easily at home without much movement space, tools, or high intensity."
