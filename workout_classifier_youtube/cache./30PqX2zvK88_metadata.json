  "description": "8 of the best bodyweight exercises to tone and strengthen your muscles at home. Includes beginner, intermediate, and advanced options for upper body, lower body, and core exercises to maximize your results. Keep reading for links mentioned in the video!\n\nJARED\u2019S DOORWAY PULL-UP BAR: https://urlgeni.us/amzn/pullupbar\n\n======================================\nOTHER HOME WORKOUTS YOU MIGHT ENJOY\n\nAT HOME BACK WORKOUT - NO EQUIPMENT: https://youtu.be/J6de47GLTKQ\n\n30-MINUTE LISS CARDIO WORKOUT - NO EQUIPMENT: https://youtu.be/sPGNkGU2LqY\n\n10-MINUTE PLANK CHALLENGE: https://youtu.be/LYvB7TwpC6E \n======================================\n\nNo gym membership? No equipment? NO PROBLEM!\n\nYou don\u2019t need weights, pulleys, or bands to get in a great strength-training workout. In fact when performed correctly, the right bodyweight exercises can yield similar gains in strength and muscle tone as performing resisted training in the gym.\n\nThe key is scaling your home exercises to the appropriate intensity to stimulate the muscle to grow. To put it simpler - if your exercises are hard enough, you can still see great gains without the need for any equipment.\n\nWHAT ARE THE BEST BODYWEIGHT EXERCISES?\n\nWhenever anyone asks me my opinion for which bodyweight exercise is the \u201cbest\u201d, I never quite know how to answer the question. \u201cBest\u201d can mean so many different things - best for muscle strength? Best for power? Best for muscle tone? Best upper body? Best lower body? Etc etc.\n\nFor the purposes of this video, I\u2019ve decided to focus on the \u201cbest\u201d bodyweight exercises for each of the major muscle groups in the body - Best Bodyweight PUSH Exercises (for the upper body and lower body), Best Bodyweight PULL Exercises (for the upper body and lower body), Best Bodyweight Core Exercises, and we finish off with my Best Bodyweight Total Body Exercise.\n\nI created this list for you based off my expertise with movement, function, anatomy, and EMG studies. These 8 bodyweight exercises should be foundational in any effective home workout plan and I hope you\u2019re performing them regularly.\n\nTHE BEST BODYWEIGHT EXERCISES - NO EQUIPMENT REQUIRED! (Click on the time stamps to see that part in the video)\n\nPush Ups (1:11)\nPull Ups (2:20)\nPlanks (3:47)\nSide Planks (4:46)\nSingle Leg Glute Bridge (5:51)\nSquats (7:01)\nLunges (8:22)\nBurpees (9:52)\n\nIncluding these 8 standard bodyweight exercises is the fastest way to see gains in muscle strength and development with no equipment available.\n\nBe sure to LIKE this video if you found it useful!\n\nAlso SUBSCRIBE to Tone and Tighten here on YouTube so you never miss a new video from me\n\nThanks so much for watching!\n\n\n\n-DISCLAIMER- this video is intended for educational purposes only.
