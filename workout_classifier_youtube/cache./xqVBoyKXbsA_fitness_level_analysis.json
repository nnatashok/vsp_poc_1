  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves dumbbell exercises, which typically require some coordination but are not overly complex. The metadata suggests the use of light to moderate weights, indicating that beginner levels could feasibly participate, though with more focus on form. Intermediate techniques might involve compound movements that require more control and awareness, as indicated by the focus on strength and conditioning, which suggests a need for correct execution through a variety of movements favoring moderate technique difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration of 17:17 minutes suggests a low-to-moderate effort workout, particularly relevant to the 'all fitness levels' suitability mentioned in the description. Emphasis on building strength and conditioning implies a level of effort beyond a light session, likely requiring steady energy throughout the session, qualifying as moderate difficulty. Comments about users' experiences, like taking longer to complete the session and those new to fitness finding it challenging, provide evidence that it can be moderately challenging for beginners.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The combined analysis of technique and effort difficulty suggests that this workout is suitable primarily for beginner to intermediate levels. The inclusion of weight selection (light to moderate) and a pace-governing format ensures beginners can manage their own intensity. This flexibility aligns with fitness newbies needing accessible exercises and those with slightly more experience, who can manage progressive resistance and tempo better, making intermediate a strong fit. The workout may require some level of fitness to handle the full range within the set timeframe, as indicated by users taking additional time to complete it fully."
