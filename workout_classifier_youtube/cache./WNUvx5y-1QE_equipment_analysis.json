  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled '30 Minute Full Body CARDIO HIIT Workout [ADVANCED + LOW IMPACT]' which suggests a focus on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) without specific equipment mentioned in the title. The tags such as 'cardio hiit workout no equipment', 'full body hiit workout no equipment', and 'high intensity cardio' further emphasize that this is a no-equipment workout. The description highlights that the workout involves high intensity, strength, cardio, and plyometric movements, but no equipment is explicitly listed or implied to be necessary. Additionally, despite mentioning a shop for equipment, there is no direct indication that equipment is required for this particular video. Comments and channel info also do not mention any equipment being used or necessary. Therefore, this seems to be a bodyweight only workout with no additional equipment required."
