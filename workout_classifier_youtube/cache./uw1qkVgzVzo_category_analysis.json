  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified as 'Indoor biking' with a score of 1 because the title and description specifically mention it as an addition to a cycling workout. The channel, 'Kaleigh Cohen Cycling,' and its description emphasize cycling, corroborating this classification. Additionally, specific cycling resistance levels and positions are detailed in the description, providing strong evidence for this category. 'HIIT' is included with a lower score of 0.4 because the description hints at pushing intensity, which may imply interval training. However, since the format isn't explicitly detailed as high-intensity interval training and seems more oriented towards endurance, this category is secondary."
