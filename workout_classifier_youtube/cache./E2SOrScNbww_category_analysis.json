  "categoriesExplanation": "The video was classified primarily as stretching with a score of 1 due to the explicit emphasis on a 'full body stretching routine' in both the title and description, which is aimed at improving flexibility, joint health, and muscle strength. The metadata repeatedly mentions stretching and flexibility, with detailed descriptions of the muscles and joints targeted (e.g., calves, hamstrings, quads). Additionally, the tags such as 'full body stretching routine' and 'stretching exercises for beginners' reinforce this categorization.\n\nA secondary category of mat was assigned with a score of 0.6. While the description doesn't explicitly mention it, the nature of the exercises described (e.g., 'hip rotations', 'upper back stretch', 'couch stretch') suggest they are performed on a mat, as is typical in stretching routines, and no equipment or gym is needed. \n\nOther categories like yoga or Pilates were considered, but the focus on stretching for flexibility precludes these as main classifications. The channel's emphasis on movement and flexibility further supports the identified categories."
