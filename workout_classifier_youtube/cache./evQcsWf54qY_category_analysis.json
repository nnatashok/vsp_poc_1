  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is most suitably classified under the 'Mat' category, evidenced by the title and tags that highlight a 'full body mat workout' and 'gentle workout,' which are consistent with floor exercises typically performed on a mat. This is further supported by the description mentioning 'energizing bodyweight exercises' performed without major cardio or jumping, indicating a significant mat component. The 'Body weight' category is also relevant due to the emphasis on 'bodyweight exercises,' as no additional equipment is mentioned, suggesting the use of body resistance alone. Lastly, there is a mild presence of 'Stretching' elements; the workout is low impact with a focus on moving 'with intention' and includes a 'relaxing warm-up,' which may involve flexibility or mobility work, though specifics on stretching are not extensively detailed. Comments confirm users appreciate the workout's gentle and supportive nature during menstruation, underscoring the low-impact and mat-based characteristics. Other categories were excluded due to the lack of equipment or specific practices like HIIT or Pilates, which were not indicated in the metadata."
