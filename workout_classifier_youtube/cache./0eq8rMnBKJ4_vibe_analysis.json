  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled \"Intense Interval Blast | 15 Minute Indoor Cycling Workout\" strongly suggests a high-intensity session, as evidenced by the words \"intense,\" \"interval,\" and \"blast\". This aligns with 'The Firestarter' vibe, characterized by short, explosive workouts, indicated by the 15-minute duration and repeated sprints. The description details 30-second sprints and interval training, reinforcing this. Therefore, a score of 0.75 is assigned to this vibe as it embodies explosive and fast-paced elements typical of 'The Firestarter'.\n\nThe repetitive nature of the intervals and increasing intensity of the workout, along with language such as \"pushing you to work at your limits,\" suggests elements of 'The Adrenaline Rush' vibe, as it implies heart-racing intensity and challenge. This vibe is assigned a score of 0.6 due to the combination of unpredictability and intensity during the interval shifts.\n\nLastly, the structured intervals and rhythmic cycling can relate to 'The Meditative Grind', as users zone into the repetition and steady pace throughout, implying a somewhat meditative experience amid intensity. This vibe is moderately applicable, with a score of 0.45 due to the clear interval training routine but lack of longer, steady-state endurance features typically associated with this vibe."
