  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'strong yoga inspired stretch routine' which suggests a mix of yoga and stretch movements. The technique difficulty is likely to be simple to moderate, suitable for both beginners and intermediate individuals. Yoga typically involves poses that require some coordination and body awareness which aligns with an intermediate level. However, terms like 'full body stretch' and 'for beginners' in tags suggest beginner-friendly elements as well. Therefore, both Beginner and Intermediate levels are applicable, with a stronger alignment to Intermediate due to yoga's typical complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video emphasizes that it is a 'low impact' workout and suitable for 'rest days,' which indicates a low to moderate effort. Comments suggest the workout is relaxing and suitable when energy levels are low, aligning with a Light effort difficulty. However, the 25-minute duration and settings of '50 sec on, 10 sec off' introduce moderate exertion, supporting a moderate classification as well. The absence of equipment and mention of being suitable for deconditioned users further supports primarily Light effort difficulty classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The combination of light to moderate effort, beginner to intermediate technique, and low impact nature suits both Beginner and Intermediate levels. The tags and description emphasize accessibility ('all levels,' 'yoga for beginners'), suggesting inclusivity for beginners. The metadata and user comments imply this video is approachable for most fitness levels, including very deconditioned users, with options to modify based on personal ability. Thus, both Beginner and Intermediate levels are strongly applicable. Given the channel's focus, there might be some elements aligning slightly higher, but overall, it's accessible for a wide range of fitness backgrounds."
