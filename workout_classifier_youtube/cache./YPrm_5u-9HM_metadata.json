    "Great work out! I have a heart problem,  I had to start with medicine but first I wanted to try and work on my (heart) condition. I found this workout on YT and since 3 weeks I workout everyday for 15 minutes. My bloodpressure is gone down, I&#39;m no longer short of breath and no more pain on the chest. I feel healthy and I&#39;m in much better  shape.",
    "That&#39;s one way to get the heart pumping strong! Second day on this cardio session and I must say I Love it! This is a lifestyle now for me! All about my health and Longevity for my kids in the end I really wanna be around when they all grow up and learn they can think for themselves!",
    "I&#39;ve just done this workout for the first time today, as I was a little short on time. The fact is that this turned out to be an excellent choice, and very effective workout. By the end of the 15 minutes my legs were burning, my heart rate raised and lowered as it was supposed to within the instructions, as well with my effort levels. A couple of days ago I&#39;ve done the 30 minutes hill climbing, and it was just as good! Don&#39;t bother with people who may be saying this is an unacceptable workout. They probably just need a little more time on the saddle to complete and understand a workout like this. Many thanks for this and the other videos, guys! It is a fantastic work!!",
    "This class is a bar-setter, for sure! Thanks, GCN. I&#39;m done!!!!",
    "Just got a spin bike to compliment my outdoor bike.  I used this 15 minute trainer in my own way.  I kept cadence with beat of the music, giving more resistance thru it.  It was excellent for me, 63yo.  Thank you, I will look for more of your training vids and use this one again.  Thanks !"
