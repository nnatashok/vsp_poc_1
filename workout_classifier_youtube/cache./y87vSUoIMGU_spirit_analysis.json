  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative,' evident from the title 'UNWIND 20 Min Full Body Stretch Routine' and the repeated emphasis on relaxation and flexibility in the description and tags, such as 'relax,' 'relaxing stretches,' and 'cool down stretch.' The workout is designed for unwinding and relieving stiffness, typical characteristics of restorative workouts. The user comments further emphasize the calming effect of the session, noting it brings calmness in addition to flexibility.\n\nThe secondary spirit identified is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a moderate confidence. The workout involves smooth transitions between stretches ('transition simply when you are ready'), resembling the flowing nature typical of this spirit. Tags like 'dynamic stretching' and 'yoga stretch' further support this classification, suggesting a gentle and continuous movement often seen in routine-based stretching exercises.\n\nOther spirits are less relevant here, as the workout focuses more on relaxation and stretching rather than intensity, structure, or outdoor elements."
