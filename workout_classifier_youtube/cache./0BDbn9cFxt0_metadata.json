    "Your pregnancy workouts are my favorite out of all the videos I&#39;ve tried.  I like how you go easy because going hard while pregnant makes me nervous so thank you for being realistic and easy going.  Hope everybody watching have a safe pregnancy and delivery :)",
    "Favorite pregnancy workout of all time! I watched this almost daily with my first baby and am continuing the tradition now as I&#39;m pregnant with my second baby! Thank you so much Amy! You are the best out there!",
    "I was just diagnosed with Gestational diabetes on top of being morbidly obese. I also lost my mom to a heart attack due to diabetes a few weeks before finding out I was pregnant. So basically a fear of mind is somewhat coming true, I\u2019ve been working on a life style change and today for the first time I worked out the full 30mins,I was able to do that! At the end you said \u201cwe did it\u201d and I shattered! Yes we did! <br><br>Thank you for making these videos and helping people from all sides of life. You made it feel like we were right in the same room together and were so patient and kind. I haven\u2019t worked out in years and today, thanks to YOU it happened. Can\u2019t wait to work out tomorrow",
    "Hi Amy!  Thank you so much for these videos Amy. My Wife had gestational diabetes throughout the pregnancy this allowed her to keep her blood sugars down after meals and stopped any back pains etc in late pregnancy! I also really enjoyed doing them with my wife! We could not have got through this pregnancy without you! My wife was able to do the exercises well into the 37th week. Baby was born on the 38th week!! Thanks again!",
    "26 weeks in and just did this for the 2nd time. I love the workouts. I don&#39;t feel like the lazy mum I&#39;ve been. Please post more."
