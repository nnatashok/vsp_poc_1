  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout's classification as 'Soothing & Restorative' is very clear and highly confident due to strong indicators across the metadata. The title, 'Guided Meditation for Children | Your Secret Treehouse | Relaxation for Kids,' directly emphasizes relaxation and a meditative experience aimed at easing stress and anxiety. The description further supports this by outlining the goal of taking the child on a relaxing journey to find peace and safety in a 'secret treehouse.' Tags such as 'relaxation for kids,' 'meditation for anxiety,' and 'guided visualization' further reinforce this focus. The video's channel specializes in guided meditations and sleep stories aimed at promoting tranquility and stress reduction, aligning perfectly with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. Other potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to the absence of movement or physical activity elements typically associated with them. Overall, the evidence strongly points to a sole focus on relaxation, hence the high score of 1.0 for 'Soothing & Restorative.'"
