  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is assessed as 'Beginner' due to the nature of the metadata, which focuses on a guided meditation for deep relaxation. The metadata describes the session as one that requires only listening and mental visualization, which are straightforward activities without the need for physical coordination or complex movements. The comments indicate accessibility to users new to meditation, further supporting this level assignment.",

    }
  ],
  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified primarily as 'Light' since meditation is generally a low-energy activity focused on relaxation and mental calmness. The 35-minute duration might present a slight challenge for complete beginners to stay focused, hence a small score in 'Moderate' due to mental engagement required to maintain focus. User comments highlight the calming nature rather than any significant exertion, supporting this classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner' due to the straightforward technique and low physical exertion. However, the meditation duration justifies a small inclusion of 'Intermediate' level, considering maintaining focus for a prolonged period may pose slight difficulty for those inexperienced in meditation practice. The overwhelmingly positive feedback from users new to meditation further corroborates this classification."
