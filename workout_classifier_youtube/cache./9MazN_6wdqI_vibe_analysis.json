  "vibesExplanation": "The strongest vibe identified is 'The Zen Flow' with a score of 1.0, indicated by the video's emphasis on a 'slow flow' and 'mindful movement' focusing on breath and bodily sensations, which are typical markers of this vibe. The title and description both highlight stress reduction and intentional movement, further supporting this classification. Aspects of calming and grounding exercises, such as child's pose and savasana, emphasize a gentle, unhurried flow, increasing confidence in this classification.\n\n' The Reboot Workout' is also relevant, scoring 0.7. The workout involves a comprehensive set of gentle stretches aimed at relaxation and ease, fitting the notion of a total-body refresh by reducing stress, consistent with user comments describing feelings of relaxation afterward.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Deep Recharge' scored 0.5. The focus on relaxation, augmented by savasana and the emotional release noted in user comments, suggests a degree of nervous system reset and release of pent-up stress, supporting this vibe.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Comfort Moves' and 'The Sleep Prep' were considered but not chosen due to the primary focus on flow and active intentional movement rather than purely comforting or sleep-preparatory elements."
