  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen for this workout is 'Pilates' with a score of 0.95, as this is explicitly stated in the title ('Express PILATES WORKOUT') and throughout the metadata, such as tags ('pilates workout', 'full body pilates') and the description ('Moderate to Intermediate level Express Pilates class'). The channel focus on Pilates, highlighted in the channel description and comments, supports this classification.\n\nThe 'Mat' category is also relevant, with a score of 0.5, due to the mention of 'no equipment' in both the title and tags ('no equipment pilates workout'). This implies exercises are performed on a mat, consistent with floor exercises typical for mat workouts. The association of a Mat product link further supports this inclusion.\n\nOther categories were considered, such as 'Yoga', because of the instructor's background and channel focus. However, there is no direct reference to yoga in this specific video. The strong emphasis on Pilates, combined with mat-based exercises, supports excluding other potential categories for this analysis."
