  "vibesExplanation": "The video title and description emphasize a beginner-friendly, slow-paced vinyasa flow aimed at building strength and flexibility, ideal for new yogis. Keywords like 'beginner flow,' 'strength & flexibility,' and 'slower-paced' suggest a calm, intentional practice, aligning well with \"The Zen Flow\" vibe. This choice is supported by the description's emphasis on moving slowly in and out of poses and focusing on balance, foundational strength, and a good stretch. The focus on foundational aspects also aligns with \"The Foundation Builder,\" as it addresses building basic yoga proficiency. The comments further reveal users' experiences of gradual improvement and stress reduction, reinforcing a rejuvenating and foundational vibe, hence a score for \"The Reboot Workout\" is assigned. There is high confidence in these vibes given the consistent messaging across the metadata."
