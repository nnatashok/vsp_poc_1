  "description": "Hi there \ud83d\udc4b\nWelcome Back To Another Video\n\"25 minute Weight Loss Workout in a Chair | HIIT for Seniors, Beginners\"\n\nThis 25-minute Weight Loss Workout is a HIIT for seniors and beginners that will burn fat, improve your cardiovascular system, and build stamina. This at home work features 4 sets of 2 exercises, each done in 20 second, 30 second, and 40 second intervals. My mom rocks it in a chair and I do standing exercises at an intermediate level. It's about 2000 steps, more or less depending on your pace.\n\nHIIT workouts (high intensity interval training) can be done at any age. HIIT burns more calories than steady state exercise during and after exercising.  A study of sedentary women compared 20 minutes of HIIT with 40 minutes of steady-state exercise. The HIIT subjects were the only ones who lost fat-primarily belly fat. Yay!\n\nThis workout is for all levels -- you can exercise in a chair or exercise at an intermediate level standing.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:54 Warm Up\n03:09 Exercise Set 1\n09:28 Exercise Set 2\n14:21 Exercise Set 3\n19:50 Exercise Set 4\n24:31 Cooldown\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Want to try our other HIIT workouts?

    "Whew, this was a good one! Your mom had me laughing so hard I had to look away and close my eyes so I wouldn&#39;t get confused and follow her in the 2nd round. I totally get it with the brain confusion/workout. You deserve your hot dog for that one, for sure. Love this one April. I was able to keep up with you, finally, on the higher intense version. It only took me 6 months of working out to be able to go to higher intensity (LOL). Thank you so much for continuing these workouts, it has helped me greatly.",
    "The workout was great. The harmonious banter between mother and daughter made it even better. Thank you. \u2764",
    "Oh my I loved that one ! Finding your videos is THE BEST thing I have done in years! I am so unfit and inflexible I couldn\u2019t do a whole one of your videos at first , but after doing one or two a day I can now ! I started off with the stretching and warmup ones and worked my way up as well as walking everyday . I honestly can\u2019t thank you enough !!!<br>\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
    "I do your routines every day, but I rarely leave a comment. My sister in Guatemala follows you too and is happy doing your exercises. The ambiance you create is cozy and fun. I feel like you two were long time friends. Thank you so much!",
    "As a physical therapist, I just want to say, you are great for sharing this! \u2764"
