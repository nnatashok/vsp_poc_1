  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled \"10 Min Yoga Full Body Stretch\" and its associated metadata strongly suggest a vibe focused on gentle, breath-centered yoga with a goal of improving flexibility and mobility. The presence of tags like \"morning stretch,\" \"morning flow,\" and \"full body stretch\" aligns with characteristics of \"The Zen Flow,\" which is described as grounding and breath-centered. This assignment is made with high confidence due to the explicit focus on intentional yoga practice for mobility and relaxation.\n\nAdditionally, the video serves as \"The Reboot Workout,\" focusing on a \"full body stretch\" and \"total body yoga,\" which indicates a low-stress, restorative quality. The description supports this with statements about improving flexibility and strength for better mobility. User comments reflect the routine's role in aiding relaxation and post-exercise recovery, emphasizing daily commitment and time efficiency, further supporting both vibes.\n\nOther potential vibes such as \"The Meditative Grind\" were considered but excluded because the video's duration and intent lean more towards a refreshing stretch than repetitive endurance or meditation."
