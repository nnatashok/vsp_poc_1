    "Holy cow. Great workout. I&#39;ve been following GCN for awhile and this was my first workout video to follow along. Really kicked me into gear. Gotta keep this up! Keep making videos like this and my fianc\u00e9 won&#39;t recognize me!",
    "In the last 2 mos, I have been doing this workout 5x a week, and challenging my self with higher resistance and man, it not only helped with weight loss but also with my asthma! Feeling good in and out!  Sincerely, I thank you GCN!",
    "I&#39;ve been here from the start.  Helped me with losing weight after 2 babies. Now, the baby is almost 5!",
    "Bring this guy back to GCN!",
    "I love the sport orientated training this has. Alot of spin classes feel like an aerobics class. But this had me in a mindset of being out on the road, and in a race. Bloody loved it!"
