  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under the 'Yoga' category with a high confidence score of 1.0, as the title explicitly mentions 'Yoga' and the description and tags refer to various yoga poses focused on posture improvement. Specific poses like 'cobra pose,' 'locust pose,' 'downward facing dog,' and 'cat and cow' are traditional yoga postures known for enhancing flexibility and posture, reinforcing this classification.\n\nThe video is also related to the 'Stretching' category with a moderate score of 0.5. The description emphasizes spine extension, flexion, and core strengthening, which are aspects of flexibility training typically associated with stretching exercises. Tags like 'back stretch,' 'back pain relief,' and 'yoga for the spine' support the inclusion of this category.\n\nThe metadata does not suggest other categories such as 'Pilates,' 'HIIT,' or 'Mat', primarily because the video is explicitly yoga-focused without crossover into other forms of mat or intensity-based exercises."
