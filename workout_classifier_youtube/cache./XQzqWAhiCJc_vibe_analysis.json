  "vibesExplanation": "The video '7 Minute Stretching - FULL BODY For Mobility, Stress Relief & Active Recovery!' is primarily identified with \"The Reboot Workout\" vibe because it focuses on deep stretching, stress relief, and active recovery. The description emphasizes releasing tight muscles and improving flexibility, which are key aspects of a workout designed for total body refreshment. The inclusion of phrases like 'stress relief' and 'active recovery' further aligns with this vibe, scoring a strong 0.9 due to very explicit indications.\n\n\"The Zen Flow\" vibe is also relevant, as the workout slower-paced with a focus on intentional movement and breath, which is typical of calming practices like yoga. The vibe score is 0.7 due to the emphasis on mobility and flexibility improvements that are often associated with mindful, intentional practices like yoga (referenced in tags like \"full body stretch yoga\").\n\nOther potential vibes such as \"The Comfort Moves\" were considered but not selected, as the intensity and purpose are more geared towards flexibility and recovery than strictly low-intensity, safe movements."
