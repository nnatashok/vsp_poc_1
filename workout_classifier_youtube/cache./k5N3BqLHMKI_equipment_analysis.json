  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata strongly indicates that a treadmill is essential for this workout. The title specifically mentions 'Interval Run' and over 1000+ calorie burn, which is feasible with high-intensity treadmill running. The description explicitly states '20-minute high intensity interval training workout on our BXT216 Treadmill,' clearly highlighting the central role of the treadmill. Additionally, tags such as 'treadmill,' 'run,' 'running,' and 'HIIT' all imply a focus on running exercises typically performed on a treadmill. The inclusion of a giveaway for a treadmill further reinforces its necessity in executing the workout. Therefore, I have very high confidence that a treadmill is required for this workout."
