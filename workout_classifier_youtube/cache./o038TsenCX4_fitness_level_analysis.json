  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves exercises like lunges, renegade rows, shoulder presses, and push-up to dumbbell burpees. These movements require some coordination and balance, particularly the Bulgarian lunges and rotational rows, aligning with an Intermediate level. The presence of supersets and advanced variations like the Bulgarian lunge with dumbbells suggests some elements of Advanced technique, but the overall routine is more fitting for Intermediate users, supported by the use of adjustable weights and modifiable exercises.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 25 minutes long and includes exercises designed to elevate heart rate, like the push-up to dumbbell burpees, indicating a Moderate to Challenging effort. The intensity is increased by using supersets with minimal rest (20 seconds), pushing beyond Moderate difficulty. Strength and cardio elements combined with compound movements contribute to a higher energy expenditure, placing this workout more toward the Challenging spectrum, especially for deconditioned users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the Intermediate to Advanced technique requirements and Moderate to Challenging effort levels, the workout is clearly not suitable for absolute beginners. It is most appropriate for Intermediate users due to its manageable workout length and modifiable exercises. However, the intensity of the burpees and the complexity of the Bulgarian lunges support an Advanced fitness level inclusion. Considering users can self-select dumbbell weights, this workout can accommodate a range of abilities from Intermediate to Advanced."
