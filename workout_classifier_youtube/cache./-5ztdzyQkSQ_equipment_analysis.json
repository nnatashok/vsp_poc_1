  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled \"30-Minute Full-Body Strength-Training Workout With Weights,\" which explicitly indicates the use of weights. The description further specifies the need to \"grab a pair of medium weights, anywhere from 8 to 20 pounds.\" This clear mention of weights translates directly to the use of 'Dumbbells' as the required equipment, hence a high confidence score of 0.9. The specific mention of the weight range (8 to 20 pounds) aligns with dumbbells used in strength-training workouts. There is no indication of other equipment being necessary as no other equipment is referenced in the title, description, or tags."
