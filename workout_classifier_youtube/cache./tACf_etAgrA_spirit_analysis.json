  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this video is 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.8. This classification is based on the progressive exercises listed in the comments, such as 'Blocked Pushups \u27a1\ufe0f Negative (Pillow) Push Up' and 'Stationary Hold \u27a1\ufe0f Negative Pull Up', which suggest a methodical approach to calisthenics, crucial for beginners. The channel\u2019s emphasis on 'SMARTER not HARDER fitness advice' also supports this spirit by emphasizing efficiency and proper technique.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm', which scored 0.4 due to the mention of smooth transitions and the need for coordination in exercises like 'Bodyweight Squats \u27a1\ufe0f Squat Jumps'. The user comment praising the host's soothing voice hints at an element of rhythm and synchronous movement. However, the evidence is less explicit, resulting in a moderate match.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded because the workout is described as beginners-friendly and focused more on structured progression than intensity or relaxation."
