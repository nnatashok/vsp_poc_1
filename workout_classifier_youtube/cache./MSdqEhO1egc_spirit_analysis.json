  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata strongly indicates the 'Soothing & Restorative' workout spirit. The title '15-Minute Yoga Nidra for Peace and Relaxation' and description repeatedly mention terms like 'peace', 'relaxation', and 'calmness', highlighting the focus on stress reduction and mental tranquility. The terms 'Yoga Nidra', a form of guided meditation, supports a restorative and relaxing experience. Tags such as 'guided meditation for calmness' and 'guided meditation 15 minutes' further affirm this classification. User comments expressing feelings of relaxation and gratitude, along with mentions of reduced anxiety and enhanced energy, underscore the restorative benefits experienced by viewers. Consequently, the extremely high confidence and strong match (score of 0.95) are justified for the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. Other potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are not applicable due to the lack of indicators of movement patterns, intensity, or structured training protocols."
