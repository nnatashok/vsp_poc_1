  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is clearly labeled for beginners, with tags and comments emphasizing simplicity and accessibility. The focus is on basic calisthenics that improve core and general body strength without equipment, which often implies simple bodyweight movements. User feedback appreciates the straightforward nature of the exercises, suggesting a primary beginner-level technique. However, the mention of 'improving core strength' and the progressive nature of calisthenics indicate a mild element of intermediate complexity for those new to exercise.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Based on the video duration of 24 minutes and the description encouraging beginners to proceed at their own pace, the effort difficulty is most likely light to moderate. The emphasis on 'doing the reps that work for you' implies an adaptable workout pace, suitable for beginners while still offering enough challenge to engage those with some fitness background. The lack of equipment and focus on calisthenics suggest movements that can be physically demanding, thus covering both light and moderate classifications for different users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout's target audience is beginners, as explicitly stated across tags, comments, and descriptions. Given it is a 24-minute session, a pure beginner could still manage, but with moderate physical engagement, more experienced beginners or those with slight prior exposure to exercise might also find it beneficial. The community comments and promotion of foundational techniques support a primary beginner classification, with a secondary assessment for individuals at an intermediate level who may still find value in focusing on form and foundational strength."
