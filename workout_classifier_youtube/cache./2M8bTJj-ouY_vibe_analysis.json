  "vibesExplanation": "The selected workout vibes are based on the analysis of the video metadata as follows:\n\n1. **The Meditative Grind (0.7)**: The workout is described as a 'muscular-endurance' session with repetitive exercises and rest periods. The format involves sets of back-to-back exercises without immediate changes, which resembles the consistent rhythm and repetition characteristic of 'Meditative Grind' workouts. The use of a manageable weight and gradual progression adds to the repetitive and steady nature of this vibe.\n\n2. **The Disciplined Grind (0.6)**: The video targets advanced strength training through structured and disciplined routines (e.g., three groups of exercises executed in sequence). It fosters a no-excuse, execute-focused mindset, as suggested by the advanced level and muscular endurance components.\n\n3. **The Progression Quest (0.5)**: While not the primary focus, the description mentions 'progressive overload' and encourages viewers to increase weights over time, indicating a methodical approach to improvement. This aligns with 'Progression Quest,' although it's less emphasized compared to the other vibes.\n\nThe 'Warrior Workout' was considered but excluded due to the lack of high-intensity, primal energy elements typical of that vibe. The confidence level is high as the descriptors in the metadata clearly point to structured endurance and progression themes."
