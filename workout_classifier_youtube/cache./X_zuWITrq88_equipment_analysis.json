  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is titled 'Full Body Stretch and Strength Routine', emphasizing stretching, which usually requires minimal equipment. The description explicitly mentions doing the routine on a 'mat', which is needed for floor exercises. The tags and description focus on stretching and flexibility, further indicating the likelihood of a mat being the primary or only equipment used. Although there are no mentions of weights or other gear, the emphasis on the mat in the description provides high confidence that it is the sole necessary equipment, leading to a confidence score of 0.9 for the mat."
