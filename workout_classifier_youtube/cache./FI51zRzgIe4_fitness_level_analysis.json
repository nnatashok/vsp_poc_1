  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated at a high confidence level of Beginner due to the explicit mention in the metadata multiple times that the routine is intended for beginners. The exercises listed like lumbar rotation, supine hamstring, and child's pose are fundamental stretching exercises with simple movements requiring minimal technique and coordination. The video emphasizes that there are no complex transitions or positions, making it accessible for novices. A small score is assigned to Intermediate for those unfamiliar with any form of exercise, as some balance and coordination (albeit minimal) might be needed, but overall the target is clearly beginners.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This workout is classified as Light effort difficulty. The video is only 8 minutes long and the exercises are designed to be gently stretching rather than physically demanding. The emphasis on improving flexibility and decreasing tension without intense physical exertion suggests low energy expenditure, further supported by the focus on stretches and a calm, follow-along format. Comments from users, including those who have practiced stick with the routine to improve gradually, corroborate the low physical demand of the workout.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the Beginner technique difficulty and the Light effort difficulty, the required fitness level is predominantly Beginner, with a very high score. The metadata and content are clearly tailored to completely new exercisers, those with very low current flexibility, or deconditioned individuals seeking an entry-level routine. The Intermediate score is minimal since users with slightly more experience or basic fitness may also find it helpful for maintaining flexibility, as indicated by community feedback, though the primary aim is accessibility for true beginners."
