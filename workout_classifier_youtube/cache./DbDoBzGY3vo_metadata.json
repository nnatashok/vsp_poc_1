    "Honestly I\u2019m 14 year old girl with a lot of family issues and I get panic attacks all the time even if I\u2019m just sitting on the sofa. But listening to this made me calm and steady again \ud83e\udd72",
    "That man said \u201cthank you for taking some time for YOU today\u201d that made me cry, I needed this for sure",
    "That went so quick! It felt like I was just at the beginning and then he said to open my eyes\u2026 fantastic meditation, thank you \ud83d\ude4f",
    "I was in a full \u201cpanic attack.\u201d  I tried deep breathes and holds.  Nothing worked for 20+ minutes.  My heart was beating all over the place.  My wife found this, and after playing the five minute message, I was 100% back to normal.  I never thought it would work to that degree.  Now, every day, I stop mid morning and afternoon just to dissipate any stress.  THANK YOU MIKE!!  You changed my life!   Update:  after 2 months, not only have I not had any panic episodes, my heart palpitations have decreased considerably.  Nearly zero.  I spent several weeks following the 20 minute guided breathing.  Between these two, it has been life changing.  Sometimes while driving or really almost anywhere I&#39;ll breath in and out slowly.  I&#39;m convinced this dissipates any stress that might have otherwise presented itself physically via a panic attack.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMEFBM0pEQw&amp;t=880\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMEFBM0pEQw&amp;t=880s</a>"
