  "categoriesConfidence": 0.9,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary focus of the video is on treadmill running form, explicitly indicated by the title ('Treadmill Running Form For Beginners') and reinforced by tags such as 'Treadmill Running', 'Treadmill Running Form', and 'Treadmill For Beginners'. These strong indicators justify a high score of 0.9 for the 'Treadmill' category.\n\nThe 'Running' category is also relevant, as the video provides running form guidance applicable to treadmill conditions, which is a subset of running techniques. The description mentions learning how to run indoors, contributing to a broader context of running beyond just treadmill use. Therefore, 'Running' is included with a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nThe channel's focus on running ('The Run Experience') and user comments discussing treadmill running experiences further confirm these classifications. Other potential categories were not included due to the specific focus on treadmill and running-related content without elements of other fitness activities or exercises."
