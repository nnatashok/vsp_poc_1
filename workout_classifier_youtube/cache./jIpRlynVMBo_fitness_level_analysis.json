  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes various compound exercises like goblet squats, bent over rows, and even technical movements such as the dumbbell snatch, which require some coordination and control, elevating the technique difficulty to intermediate. Using dumbbells adds to the complexity, especially considering diverse movements targeted at different muscle groups (e.g., Romanian deadlifts, renegade rows). However, the absence of very complex movements like olympic lifts prevents the rating from reaching 'Advanced', though the inclusion of movements like dumbbell snatches necessitates slight consideration for advanced technique.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 20 minutes long (with a 26-minute total duration including a cooldown), featuring a 40-second work followed by a 20-second rest interval structure. This setup, combined with exercises demanding a moderate pace and incorporating compound lifts, like thrusters, indicates a moderate level of effort difficulty. The utilization of dumbbells for the entire workout suggests higher energy expenditure, pushing the effort towards 'Challenging', especially for deconditioned users. However, the diverse and primarily strength-focused nature, plus the short intervals, justifies a primary classification of moderate difficulty.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The primary required fitness level is intermediate due to the blend of intermediate technique difficulty and moderate to challenging effort. The provision for lighter/moderate weight options offers some flexibility for beginners, yet the inclusion of movements like snatches and the pace of workout pushes the minimum required level to intermediate. Advanced users can still find it challenging due to options for increased weight and the incorporation of sequential exercises targeting all major muscle groups. Given it's low impact and described as suitable for all levels, beginners on the threshold with some prior experience might attempt, but the full scope leans more towards intermediate fitness levels."
