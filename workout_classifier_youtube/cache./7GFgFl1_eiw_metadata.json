    "I have done the HIIT with great success. This is an excellent, no non-sense video. I am a 70-year-old male, recovering from a shoulder injury. The elliptical trainer along with the saltwater pool at my gym has been a God send.",
    "I know it gets a bad rap, but I\u2019m always on the elliptical. It\u2019s great cardio that is very forgiving on the joints. I burn 525-620 calories in 45 minutes to an hour on interval intensity mode. It surely tones my hammies, my bum and it burns man boobs flat and beautiful. 3-5 hours, 4 days a week. Honestly, I\u2019ve found the most important aspect of working out is getting at least 7 hours of good sleep. Now that I\u2019m on the wrong side of 30, I am absolutely not even close to 100% if I\u2019m sleep-deprived when working out on consecutive days. If you want to maximize your performance and return, sleep recovery is most essential.",
    "I love the elliptical machine workout. It gives whole body workout. Can burn double the calories. But in this gym is not soooo nice. It&#39;s very shaky.",
    "Oh my goodness you answered all my questions thanks \ud83d\ude0a I did like &amp; subscribed \u2764",
    "but if i&#39;m burning on the elliptical 450 cals for 32 min with with a heart between 80-90% and avg heart rate of 82%, with 5 sets of intervals 7 days a week , i&#39;d say i&#39;m pretty good as it is?"
