  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit for this workout is 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.9. This is evidenced by the detailed focus on specific exercises like Cobra Push Up, the use of a timer for 45 seconds on and 15 seconds rest, and the emphasis on fundamentals for progression in the EPIC program. The description mentions a structured approach with 'many challenging movements' and specific protocols, indicating high confidence for this classification. 'Flow & Rhythm' is also present but to a lesser extent (0.5) due to the encouragement of personal pacing within the workout, which allows for some rhythmic flow of movement. Finally, 'Soothing & Restorative' is considered with a lower score of 0.3, as the emphasis on form and maintaining alignment aligns with gentle and methodical practice, suitable for beginners, despite the workout's intensity. Other potential spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are less relevant given the 'beginner' focus and lack of outdoor or sports-specific elements."
