  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Meditation,' as the title, tags, and description heavily focus on meditation-related elements, particularly relaxation and guided meditation for sleep and insomnia. Keywords like 'guided sleep meditation,' 'guided meditation,' and 'meditation' are explicitly present in the metadata, supporting a high confidence level (0.9) for this categorization. The channel specializes in meditation content, reinforcing this classification.\n\nThere is also a possibility of 'Breathing exercises' being involved due to the focus on relaxation techniques often associated with guided meditative practices. However, there is no explicit mention of specific breathing exercises, which results in a lower confidence score of 0.5 for this category. Therefore, it's a secondary category based on typical meditation techniques.\n\nOther categories like 'Yoga,' 'Stretching,' or 'Pilates' were excluded due to a lack of physical movement content indicated in the metadata, as the focus is purely on meditation and relaxation techniques."
