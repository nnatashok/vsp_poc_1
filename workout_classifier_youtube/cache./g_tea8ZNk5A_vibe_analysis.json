  "vibesExplanation": "The 'Zen Flow' vibe is the strongest match for this video. The description emphasizes breath-awareness, self-practice, and being present, with phrases like 'only you, the music, your breath.' This points to an intentional and grounding experience (score: 0.9). The 'Reboot Workout' also fits well, as the routine is focused on relaxation, recovery, and stress relief, indicated by terms like 'relaxation' and 'Erholung & Entspannung' (score: 0.7). The 'Deep Recharge' vibe is moderately relevant due to the emphasis on a calming, no-talking session, which mirrors nervous system reset practices, but it's not as prominent because of the lack of explicitly ultra-gentle language or techniques (score: 0.5). While the music and ambient sounds support a tranquil experience, other potential vibes like 'The Groove Session' were excluded due to the absence of expressive, fun, or dance-like elements."
