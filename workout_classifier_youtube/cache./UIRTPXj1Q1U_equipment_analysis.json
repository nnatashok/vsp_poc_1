  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"10 Minute Lower Body Stretch Routine (For Tight Hamstrings & Hip Flexors)\" indicates a focus on stretching exercises. The description explicitly mentions, \"Grab a yoga mat, try out the stretch,\" suggesting the use of a mat. Given that the routine targets the lower body and involves floor exercises, a mat is essential to perform the stretches comfortably on the ground. The use of a mat is central to the workout, aligning with the typical need for mats in stretching routines, which justifies a high confidence score of 0.9. No other equipment is implied or mentioned in the metadata."
