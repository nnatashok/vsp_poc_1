  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Pilates', which scores 0.9. The video title, tags, and description repeatedly emphasize the Pilates nature of the workout, describing it as a 'Gentle Pilates' workout. The channel itself is focused on Pilates content, evident from both the channel name 'The Girl With The Pilates Mat' and the channel description of offering 'Pilates and Dance-based fitness'. These factors give very high confidence that Pilates is the main focus.\n\nThe secondary category of 'Breathing exercises' is scored at 0.6. The title explicitly mentions 'Guided Breathing', and the description supports this with statements about focusing on 'guided breathing', which is further reinforced by user comments noting the breath work involved. Therefore, there is a strong presence of breathing exercises integrated into the routine, justifying its inclusion as a secondary category. The focus on relaxation and stress relief supports this classification."
