  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is centered around performing 100 pushups daily, which is a bodyweight exercise. The metadata, including the title, description, and tags, consistently emphasize pushups and bodyweight training. Phrases such as '100 Pushup Workout,' 'bodyweight training,' and 'calisthenics' imply that no additional equipment is needed. Moreover, user comments detail personal experiences with the workout, focusing solely on pushups and not mentioning any equipment use. Although the description mentions using a Heria weight vest to enhance training, it is not required for the completion of the workout, suggesting it's an optional addition for those seeking increased intensity. With no explicit or implicit mention of equipment necessity or usage outside of bodyweight, this workout appears to be designed to be performed without any additional equipment, relying on bodyweight as resistance."
