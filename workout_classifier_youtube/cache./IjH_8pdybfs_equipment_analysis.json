  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'POST-WORKOUT STRETCH for Injury Prevention & Flexibility' strongly suggests the use of a mat. Stretching routines typically require a comfortable surface, and mats are commonly used to provide cushioning and support during such exercises. Although the video description does not explicitly mention a mat, the focus on flexibility and post-workout stretching implies the use of a mat is highly likely. Additionally, stretching is performed on the floor, further supporting the likelihood of a mat being used. Therefore, the confidence score for needing a mat is 0.7. No other equipment is indicated or implied from the metadata provided."
