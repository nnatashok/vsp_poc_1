  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is best classified as \"The Meditative Grind\" with a score of 0.7. This classification is supported by the workout's focus on repetitive, manageable pacing involving walking and light jogging intervals. The description mentions \"run and recovery intervals\" which implies a rhythmic, steady approach. Furthermore, user comments highlight consistency and progression, aligning with the 'grinding' element of the vibe.\n\nSecondary, the \"The Comfort Moves\" vibe is relevant with a score of 0.6 due to its appeal to beginners, emphasizing safety and comfort. The description encourages staying within comfort zones and user testimonials reflect a non-intimidating vibe that's beginner-friendly.\n\n\"The Endorphin Wave\" is considered with a score of 0.5 because the workout includes jogging and walking, which provides a feel-good movement and a steady build in the routine. The structure involves progressive intervals and a positive user experience similar to an endorphin release post-workout.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Zen Flow' were not chosen as the workout involves more active jogging routines and lacks the breath-centered and grounding focus."
