  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified predominantly under the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (0.7) due to its emphasis on continuous, smooth movement typical of Pilates, as evidenced by the 'standing pilates cardio' and 'full body workout' labels. The inclusion of music-driven pacing and coordination indicates flow elements, supported by the channel's focus on combining dance-based fitness with Pilates.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also suggested by the fun and energetic tone of the metadata, with comments indicating a positive and engaging experience (e.g., 'feels like a safe space').\n\n'Soothing & Restorative' (0.6) is represented in the 'no jumping', 'safe for the joints', and 'improve your cardiovascular health' elements, which suggest a workout style that is gentle yet effective, focusing on health and recovery - important aspects of soothing exercises.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' aligns with the description of being suitable for various ages and focusing on mind-body connection, as indicated in the channel's community goals.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' (0.6) further describes the workout's nature, noted from its specific protocol (warm-up, full workout, cool-down) and a pilates-component dealing with discipline and technique, seen in the terms 'standing cardio workout' and 'pilates for weight loss'. The structured nature is supported by the methodical inclusion of warm-up and cool-down, enhancing the session's disciplined approach."
