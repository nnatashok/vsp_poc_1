  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Warrior Workout' due to the high-intensity, sweat-dripping aspects of the HIIT routine. The title explicitly states 'Killer HIIT,' emphasizing a challenging and intense workout experience designed to unleash one's primal energy. Words like 'killer,' 'sweat,' 'push limits,' and 'hardest to complete' in comments further reinforce the energetic, sweat-intensive, and vigorous nature of the workout, aligning perfectly with this vibe.\n\nThe secondary vibe, 'The Tactical Athlete,' is suggested by the 'Military Monday' theme, which implies a military-inspired workout focusing on performance. The description mentions targeting major muscle groups and improving endurance, which hints at a performance-oriented approach akin to tactical training. The presence of structured intervals (50 sec work, 10 sec rest) offers a strategic component, appropriate for tactical training themes.\n\nThese vibes are substantiated by the combination of tags like 'intense hiit,' 'military workout,' and the considerable enthusiasm and sweat-focused feedback from the comments. Some uncertainty is present in classifying 'The Tactical Athlete' due to less explicit tactical elements, hence a slightly lower score."
