    "What a wonderful run! Don&#39;t have a treadmil, so I managed with running in place in my living room and I had a blast! Every time there was a puddle, or a bridge, or a woodden  path or a rock on the way I would raise my knees a bit more. Thank you for this! It&#39;s such a lovely landscape with the river, the mountains, the snow, the rabbits, the wind blowing through the bushes and that big bird in the middle of the way!\ud83d\ude04 Those bridges had a 20 person limit, but you just carried thousands with you \u2764\ufe0f",
    "I\u2019m glad I found this! 23 year old former athlete \ud83d\ude22 I was diagnosed with Dysautonomia and orthostatic intolerance- went downhill very suddenly. I\u2019ve been bed ridden for 3 months because my HR goes crazy high. I\u2019ve missed working out and going out for walks soooo badly and I just walked in place to your video \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f Doing what I can, thank you!"
