  "categoriesExplanation": "The video, titled '40 MIN KILLER HIIT WORKOUT - Full Body, No Equipment, Circuit Training - (HIIT IT HARDER DAY 5),' provides explicit evidence for categorizing the workout as HIIT. The phrases 'HIIT WORKOUT,' 'Full Body,' and 'Circuit Training' clearly indicate a High-Intensity Interval Training session focusing on full-body engagement (confidence 1.0). The workout involves 'Circuit Style Training' for 30 minutes with intervals of 50 seconds of work followed by 10 seconds of rest, further reinforcing the HIIT classification.\n\nThe description and tags also emphasize 'no equipment' and 'body weight workout,' which supports a secondary classification under 'Body weight' exercises, as these involve using one's body as resistance (score 0.6). The tags such as 'body weight workout' and 'super sweaty workout' indicate emphasis on intense movements using body weight.\n\nNo equipment is mentioned, and the workout concludes with a cool-down period, aligning with typical HIIT training protocols. Although terms like 'circuit training' could suggest elements of calisthenics, the strong focus on interval training justifies excluding calisthenics as a primary category."
