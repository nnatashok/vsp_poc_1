  "vibesExplanation": "The video title, description, and tags suggest a focus on high-intensity interval cycling, specifically mentioning 'micro intervals' and 'tempo sessions', indicating a workout that is both focused and repetitive, typical of 'The Meditative Grind'. The choice of words like 'tempo sessions' and 'intervals' supports a methodical and sustained effort, hence a score of 0.75 for 'The Meditative Grind'. \n\nAdditionally, the workout's aim to improve speed and climbing ability, through a structured interval format, aligns with 'The Endorphin Wave', which involves a steady build in energy and endurance. Comments expressing continued use of the video for fitness consistency over the years further reinforce this vibe, justifying a 0.7 score. \n\nFinally, there is an element of 'The Progression Quest' present, as the workout is designed to improve specific cycling skills over time, but this is less emphasized in the metadata, resulting in a moderate score of 0.5. The absence of a competitive element, gamification, or intense focus on technique and utmost skill refinement led to excluding 'The Competitor' and 'The Masterclass Workout' vibes."
