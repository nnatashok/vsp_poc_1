  "title": "30 MIN FULL BODY STRETCHING - perfect for rest days / No Equipment I Pamela Reif",
  "description": "This 30min Full Body Stretching Routine is perfect for Rest Days or anytime your muscles feel extra stiff or sore. This also helps to increase mobility and flexibility, which then again helps to perform exercises during our other workouts better.\u00a0\nI also like to do this before bed, if I need to calm down my mind and feel like relaxing. \n\nThe routine is basically a longer version of the \u201e15min Daily Stretch\u201c :) We will stretch our entire body: from neck, to hamstrings, thighs, butt, hip flexors, back, spine mobility, hip mobility and so on. I\n\nxx\n__\n\nNo Equipment needed. Just prepare a soft surface like a yoga mat or towel :)\u00a0\n\n__\n\n\u25b8 You can find free WORKOUT SCHEDULES on my Instagram Channel.

    "guys, please do some of these stretches safely or do not do them at all! here are some of my notes (edited):<br><br>1. always always always do these stretches with warming up first. it is always best to do some strength training but even leg lifts, swings, squats and hip exercises are enough to get you warmed up properly<br>2. the pigeon pose (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJUIDBBqJOE&amp;t=1015\">16:55</a>) can be very dangerous if you do not position yourself correctly or you strain your knee too much! you can genuinely hurt your knees if you put them in a 90 degree angle right away! DO NOT put it in a 90 degree angle if it hurts you, position it closer to your body, or even right next to your thigh, especially if you are new to stretching!<br>3. this one (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJUIDBBqJOE&amp;t=1120\">18:40</a>) i just wouldn\u2019t do at all, same reasons for the pigeon pose. it can be way too dangerous for the knees to put them in a 90 degree angle and it could lead to a strain. please be careful. <br>4. when in the pancake position (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJUIDBBqJOE&amp;t=1305\">21:45</a>), squeeze your thighs always! especially when lowering your back - you do not want to harm your inner thigh tendons! if you go way too hardcore in pancake, your tendons could very much break so keep those quads activated and pressing down on the floor! if you\u2019re training for splits it\u2019s best to keep you back straight too :)<br>5. be mindful of your back, try to keep your spine aligned with your neck in stretches unless bending is needed<br>6. if anything hurts, especially your knees - STOP. stretches can be uncomfortable but if you feel actual shooting pain stop immediately! reposition yourself in a less-intense way or if your knees that are on the floor are hurting, fold your mat underneath them or put a cushion under them! better to have less of an invasive stretch than to hurt yourself! always!<br><br><br>P.S this is in NO way a dig at pamela. i love her workouts! i just realized as i was doing this routine that some of the poses were off and wanted to correct it because i do not want anyone that has 0 experience in stretching to hurt themselves, i\u2019ve been there :/ and i also of course hope this will make your stretches even more successful! good luck!",
