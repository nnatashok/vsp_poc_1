  "categoriesConfidence": 0.9,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Meditation' with a high score of 1 because the video is explicitly described as a 'guided meditation' for helping with over-thinking, anxiety, OCD, and depression. This is reinforced by the use of tags such as 'guided meditation', 'mindfulness meditation', and 'meditation for anxiety', along with the detailed description which mentions meditation techniques like calm awareness and conscious observation. The title, channel focus, and comments further support this categorization as they explicitly reference the meditative and calming intent of the video.\n\nThe secondary category 'Breathing exercises' is assigned a lower score of 0.6. The description emphasizes 'calm awareness of the breath', which is a common technique in breathing exercises, contributing to relaxation and mental clarity, as seen in comments suggesting techniques to stop overthinking. Tags like 'relaxation' and 'mindfulness', along with the channel's focus on relaxation methods, support this categorization although they point primarily towards meditation rather than structured breathing exercises.\n\nOther categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were considered but excluded due to the lack of physical movement focus, as this is clearly a mind-body focused session rather than a physical practice."
