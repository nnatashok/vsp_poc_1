  "vibesExplanation": "The video is titled \"Best Pregnancy Stretches | 15-Min Full-Body Daily Stretch Routine | Relieve Pregnancy Symptoms,\" suggesting it involves gentle stretching designed for relaxation and relief, characteristic of \"The Reboot Workout\". The description highlights the routine's purpose to alleviate pregnancy aches, which aligns with a \"total-body refresh\". This strong alignment leads to a high score of 0.9 for \"The Reboot Workout\" vibe.\n\nFurthermore, the use of words like \"great daily pregnancy stretches,\" alongside comments describing the routine as \"relaxing\" and catered to helping with symptoms, suggests safety and comfort as emphasized by the \"The Comfort Moves\" vibe. The routine aims to relieve discomfort and incorporates prenatal yoga elements, justifying the 0.8 score for this vibe due to its relevance for expectant mothers seeking gentle movement.\n\nOther potential vibes like \"The Zen Flow\" or \"The Deep Recharge\" were considered but excluded due to the focus being more on specific symptom relief and day-to-day comfort rather than purely meditative or passive stretching."
