  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is prominently featured due to the video's emphasis on guiding viewers through meditation to cope with stress and anxiety. The description emphasizes concepts such as 'find peace,' 'surrender,' 'stillness,' and 'content with just being.' These are clear indicators of a focus on healing, relaxation, and stress reduction, justifying the high score of 0.95. \n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present but to a lesser extent. The title and description focus on 'surrender to the flow,' implying a mind-body connection and a fluid, continuous process. The background music praised in user comments also suggests a rhythmic component that aids in achieving a meditative state, contributing to a moderate score of 0.6. \n\nOther workout spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were not applicable due to the non-physical and introspective nature of the meditation, where no structured or athletic elements are mentioned."
