  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is strongly categorized as 'Stretching' based on multiple clear indicators from the metadata: the title ('Lower Body Stretch - Muscle Recovery and Stress Relief'), tags (e.g., 'stretch', 'fullbodystretch', 'musclerecovery', 'stretching at home', 'lower body stretches'), and comments mentioning the focus on stretching (e.g., 'Perfect stretches', 'one of my favorite lower body stretches'). The high confidence score of 0.9 reflects the direct emphasis on stretching for muscle recovery and stress relief.\n\nThe 'Yoga' category receives a weaker score of 0.3. The reasoning for its inclusion is the association of stretching with yoga in fitness contexts, as seen in the tags ('yoga') and mention of 'stress relief', a common benefit of yoga. However, the explicit focus of the workout is on stretching rather than yoga practices, which is why the score is lower. Other categories like 'Pilates' or 'HIIT' were excluded due to the lack of any specific references to core strengthening or high-intensity intervals, respectively."
