  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Meditation' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is supported by explicit references in the title ('Guided Meditation'), the description, and the tags which heavily emphasize 'meditation', 'guided meditation', 'law of attraction', and 'manifestation meditation'. These terms collectively indicate a focus on meditation as the central practice. \n\nThe secondary category considered is 'Breathing exercises', scored at 0.3. While there are no direct mentions of specific breathing techniques, meditation often includes a component of breath control; however, the lack of explicit focus on this in the metadata results in a lower score. \n\nPotential categories like 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were excluded due to a lack of terms related to postures or physical movement in the metadata. The video clearly centers on mental and mindful practices rather than physical exercises."
