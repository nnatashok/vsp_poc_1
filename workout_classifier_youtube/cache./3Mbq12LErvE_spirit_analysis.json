  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.9 due to its focus on stretching, relaxation, and de-stressing as highlighted in the description. The phrases 'great way to relax and de-stress,' 'unwind after a long day,' and 'relax and stay healthy' indicate a deep relaxation and restoration emphasis. The user comments emphasize the peaceful and calming nature of the workout, reinforcing this spirit. \n\nThe secondary classification, 'Flow & Rhythm,' scored at 0.7, stems from the mention of a 'beautiful stretching routine' and users describing emotional experiences likely linked to continuous and music-driven elements. The inclusion of music as an important element (noted in top comments) suggests a rhythmic flow, enhancing mind-body connection. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are not applicable due to the low-impact nature of the workout described explicitly in tags and description, focusing rather on comfort and accessibility for beginners, not structured training or sports performance."
