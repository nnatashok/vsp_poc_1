  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video metadata explicitly states that this is a 'mat pilates' workout and no additional equipment is needed. The title mentions it is a 'no equipment' workout. The description reinforces this by specifically stating, 'No equipment needed, just a Pilates mat or soft surface.' This indicates that the workout is designed to be done with bodyweight exercises only, using a mat as the base for support and comfort, which is typical for Pilates workouts. This is further supported by the tags 'mat pilates' and 'at home,' implying it's structured for minimal equipment use. Therefore, there is no equipment required beyond a mat or soft surface, aligning with the 'bodyweight only' categorization."
