  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises listed are common in beginner to intermediate strength training. Walking lunges and dumbbell rows require basic coordination and balance, fitting well into the beginner and intermediate categories. The presence of compound movements like rows and chest press suggest a bit more complexity, leaning towards intermediate. Comments suggest ease of understanding and presentation, indicating simplicity. The channel's focus on a broad audience also hints at lower complexity, supporting beginner and intermediate technique levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves 6 exercises with 3 sets of 8-12 reps each, plus optional plank sets, designed for muscle growth in a 6:25 minute format. This suggests a moderate effort level, as it requires sustained energy but does not exceed a short-duration session, implying it's accessible to beginners who can manage the rest periods. The intensity can rise to challenging if the optional planks are included. The workout is less than 20 minutes, making it suitable for lower fitness levels while still providing a challenging edge for slightly more fit users.",
