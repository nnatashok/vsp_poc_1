    "74 years old  out of shape, I weight 297, 5 ft tall.. so you see, I&#39;m very round and I&#39;m wanting to feel better about myself.  I have a pacemaker and Dr. Suggested a biking program.  For the last 2 weeks I&#39;ve done 10 minutes  2x  day to build up my endurance.  Today I found this workout and did the 15 minutes with not adverse effects.",
    "30 years old. Overweight and terrible heart health. My dad and his identical twin both had heart attacks. Just got an indoor bike off Craigslist and did this workout. I feel like I am about to die, it&#39;s fantastic.",
    "I got my indoor bike today I&#39;m 86 and overweight  I&#39;m glad I found you, wish me luck",
    "I&#39;m just getting into indoor cycling, and these are by far the best videos - I&#39;m pleased at how genuine it all is, rather than people spouting motivational quotes all the time.  There is encouragement, and it feels like proper encouragement to me.  The infographics are great, timers and data is all easy to read.  The fact this is on YouTube for free is amazing.  Looking forward to building up my fitness and getting the more challenging rides under my belt."
