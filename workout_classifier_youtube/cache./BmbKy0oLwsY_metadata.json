    "Just what I needed this morning. Stretching is as important as cardio. I\u2019m going to combine this workout with a daily 20 minute walk.",
    "Hands down the best full body stretching I have seen on You Tube!  Excellent and correct instructions!  That was the best explanation and demonstration of a standing ITB stretch.  Great work Jordan!",
    "Thank you for the video i have been looking for for years! One suggestion for future ones though; please wear contrasting colors on top and bottom as it is difficult to see some positions as the  black blends into the black on many bends and definition is completely lost for me. Thank you for posting this valuable piece!",
    "What a GREAT and useful topic for EVERYONE! Thank you \u2764\ud83c\udf80"
