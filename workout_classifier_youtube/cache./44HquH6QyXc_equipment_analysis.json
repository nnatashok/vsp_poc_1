  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Introduction to Pilates - Workout 1 | NHS' likely requires a mat. Pilates routines typically involve a range of floor exercises focused on improving core strength, flexibility, and balance, commonly performed on a mat for comfort and stability. The title and description do not specify equipment but imply activities typical for Pilates, which often include exercises performed on the floor. Given the nature of Pilates as described, a mat is highly likely to be necessary for the comfort and effectiveness of performing the exercises. Thus, a confidence score of 0.75 is assigned to the use of a mat as it is strongly implied but not expressly mentioned."
