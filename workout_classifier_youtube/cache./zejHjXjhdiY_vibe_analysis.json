  "vibesExplanation": "The selected vibes for this 30-minute bodyweight workout video primarily draw upon its description and comments, suggesting a vigorous and sweat-inducing session. \"The Warrior Workout\" vibe is attributed a score of 0.75 because the description and comments emphasize the intense, sweat-dripping nature of the workout (\"leave you dripping sweat\", \"Great total body, arms, legs, abs and bit of cardio\"). The incorporation of varying exercise styles and active recovery abs during HIIT breaks further substantiates this vibe. Secondly, \"The Endorphin Wave\" receives a score of 0.6 as the description and user comments frequently note the feel-good aspect and total-body coverage, suggesting an elevating and steady progression throughout the workout. Though the overall tone of the content, addressing multiple muscle groups and cardio integration aligns slightly with \"The Meditative Grind\", the focus on vigorous energy and high engagement leans stronger towards \"The Warrior Workout\" and \"The Endorphin Wave\"."
