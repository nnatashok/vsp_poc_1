  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title of the video explicitly mentions 'Energising Mat Pilates', indicating that a mat is necessary for this workout. This is further supported by the tags such as 'mat pilates' and 'pilates workout', which are typically performed on a mat to provide cushioning and support during floor exercises. The absence of mentions of any other equipment in the title, description, or tags, combined with the focus on Pilates, which often requires a mat for floor-based exercises, justifies a very high confidence score of 0.95 for the inclusion of a mat as required equipment. There is no evidence in the metadata to suggest the need for any other equipment."
