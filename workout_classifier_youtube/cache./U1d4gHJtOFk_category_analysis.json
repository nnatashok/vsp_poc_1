  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily categorized as a 'HIIT' workout due to repeated references to 'Tabata', 'HIIT', and 'intensity' in both the title and tags, such as '45 Min Tabata HIIT Workouts', 'hiit workouts', and 'tabata workout'. These terms strongly indicate high-intensity interval training. Additionally, the presence of the word 'Weights' in the title and tags ('full body workout at home with weights', 'hiit with weights', 'tabata workouts with weights') suggests significant usage of weights, leading to a 'Weight workout' classification. The combination of HIIT with weights is reinforced by user comments, which confirm the intensity and effectiveness of these workouts. Therefore, both categories are suggested, with higher confidence scores reflecting strong metadata support."
