    "This reminds me of when I was playing botw for the first time and didn&#39;t want it to end, so I just... stopped fast travelling completely and took my horse literally everywhere. Rode straight across the maps to finish the last sidequests. Just watched Link be on a horse for 20 minutes at a time and called that gaming lmao"
