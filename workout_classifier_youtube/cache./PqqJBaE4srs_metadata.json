    "Love how the cardio stays consistent throughout the workout. Exactly what I\u2019ve been looking for.",
    "I&#39;m a 30+ year gym rat and ex-pro athlete. During covid I got fat and depressed and quit. This was my first workout in years, and the simplicity of it is pure gold. Thank you!",
    "Madfit is indeed the best. I&#39;m on my period and don&#39;t have much energy. After finishing this quick 10-min workout I suddenly want to do more \ud83d\ude02<br><b>Edit:</b> I ended up doing another two 10-min workouts. That&#39;s 30minutes today! This is the habit -- just start small and once you&#39;re fired up, do more and keep going.",
    "No idea if I&#39;ll ever be able to do it at such a high pace, but I did it at my own pace and I&#39;m proud! Thank you!",
    "Just completed this, love that it&#39;s easy, requires no equipment,  and takes into consideration those of us like myself,  who live in an apartment and need exercises that don&#39;t cause noise to tenants below us. Thank you for this and please post more apartment friendly, zero equipment videos like this, love it!\u2764"
