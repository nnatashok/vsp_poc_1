    "So severely overweight woman here \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Got an exersize bike for Christmas and have been trying to distract myself during the 10 miles I&#39;ve been doing daily. I just beaten my time by 5 minutes, added an extra 3 miles on and actually laughed and enjoyed myself. Looking forward to coming back tomorrow, so thank you \ud83d\udc9c",
    "New at this I am disabled, both knees replaced, arthritis, chronic back pain, osteoarthritis and degenerative bone disease, my son bought me a stationary bike so I won\u2019t wither away, need all the positive energy to start a new beginning for my body \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc",
    "Hi Kaleigh. I started this workout 3.5  weeks ago and could barely make the 10 minute mark. Happy to say that I completed the whole thing today.  Thanks so much for your effort and encouragement.  Feeling good!",
    "It took me 3 tries to complete this without stopping, but now I am loving it! You are the perfect mix of positivity without being overly perky, and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m being ordered around or talked down to. I&#39;m actually enjoying cardio for the first time in my life, and I am looking forward to trying out all of your videos. Thank you!"
