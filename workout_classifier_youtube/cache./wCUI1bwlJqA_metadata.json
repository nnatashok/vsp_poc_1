    "I love everything about this: the session, the pace, the instructor, the dialog and his voice, the background...all of it. Please do more 30 minutes recovery stretch for athlete videos!",
    "Your commitment to self-care and mindfulness shines brightly. Keep nurturing your mind, body, and soul through every breath and pose. Gratitude for being a part of our yoga community. Namaste.",
    "Summary: I feel relaxed aha <br><br>As far as beginner classes go I think this was spot-on. He constantly reminded the viewer to go with the stretch where it was comfortable. I felt like as long as I focused on my breathing and my body\u2019s positioning I really was putting the work in. Grounding my palms reeeeeally helped w/not overworking my shoulders.",
    "Dude thank you soooo much. I\u2019m a powerlifter and man I needed this. I can deadlift 760lbs but I couldn\u2019t even hold the downward dog without my triceps giving out LOL I\u2019m going to do all your flows daily. I appreciate your videos so much",
    "I fell asleep at the last position, no ones talking and then I realized it ended already.  It&#39;s relaxing, thanks man."
