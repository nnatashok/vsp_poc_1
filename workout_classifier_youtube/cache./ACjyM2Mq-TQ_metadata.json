    "I follow your practices every morning. I\u2019m a person in recovery from being a homeless heroin addict to a homeowner, a Father a Husband and a Friend. Life presents challenges and opportunities to grow everyday. Although I fall short everyday, I start mine with your practices because it lets me know my Breath and Smile are always there for me, so I can never be alone, even in my darkest hour. Peace.",
    "I had a hypoxic birth and did not learn to breathe properly during my formative years. A doctor once told my mother that I breathe like a stressed out manager (and I was ten or so). I am so glad I stumbled upon your channel as you thought me that everyone can on her or his own volition do something to improve breathing and subsequently radiate positivity (and shed stuck trauma). Thank you, Sandy!",
    "In July last year I started breathing with Wim Hof every morning. A few months ago my friend recommended me your videos but I didn&#39;t check them out right away. I finally did it at the beginning of March and from that moment I&#39;ve stayed with you. Your breathing videos are a treasure... music, sounds, words, breathing techniques. I have a few favorites for morning breathing but this video is a masterpiece. I love watching what happens to my body when I finally turn off my mind. Thank you for what you do! Peace!",
