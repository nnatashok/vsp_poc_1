  "vibesExplanation": "The video clearly embodies elements of 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, as evident from its focus on \"gentle stretches for easing neck and shoulder pain and tightness.\" The video's intention to \"relax and ease tension\" aligns perfectly with a total-body refresh, scoring a high 0.9. The 'Zen Flow' vibe is also present due to the grounding and breath-centered exercises described in the metadata, with the routine beginning in a sitting position and ending with relaxation, earning it a 0.6. Meanwhile, 'The Comfort Moves' vibe is relevant as the routine is designed for beginners and ease into movement, indicated by users' comments highlighting relaxation and pain relief, scoring it a 0.5. The calm music and soothing instructionality further reinforce these vibes. Other potential vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Deep Recharge' were less fitting, as the workout is active and involves dynamic movements."
