  "spiritsExplanation": "The video 'The Ultimate Stretching Routine After Any Workout' exemplifies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The title, description, and emphasized elements such as 'ideal post workout', 'activate a relaxed & digest state', and 'do this after every training in a quiet spot' all point to a focus on recovery and relaxation. This is further supported by references to the parasympathetic state and restorative practices like yoga, making this spirit a strong match (0.9).\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also evident, though to a lesser extent, since the channel Breathe and Flow often emphasizes yoga practices, which inherently focus on smooth transitions and mind-body coordination. The description's mention of Vinyasa, a yoga style known for its flow, supports this, but the primary emphasis on relaxation suggests a slightly lower match (0.7).\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are not suitable as the workout is explicitly designed for post-training recovery rather than intense physical exertion. The lack of explicit tags or indications of adventure or outdoor settings also rules out 'Outdoor & Adventure.' The channel's focus on yoga-related content aligns the classification with soothing and rhythmic qualities."
