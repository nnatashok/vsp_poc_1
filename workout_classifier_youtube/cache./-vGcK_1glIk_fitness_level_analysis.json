  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves full-body exercises using dumbbells and is described as low impact with modifications available. This suggests the base exercises are relatively simple, though the use of dumbbells introduces an element of complexity that places the technique difficulty into the intermediate range for less experienced users. The absence of high-impact or compound exercises further supports this classification. Descriptors like 'standing only' and 'no repeat' also suggest a less complex level of movement, suitable for beginners but also offering enough challenge for intermediate users.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 33 minutes long, which can be moderate for less fit users but challenging for others, especially considering its full-body nature. The need to use dumbbells suggests a varied intensity based on user capability to select appropriate weight. The lack of repetition and variation in exercises indicates a moderate level of continuous effort. The comments about using the workout consistently for weight loss and fitness improvements suggest that it can be energy demanding for consistent users, pushing it towards challenging for some.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the combination of technique and effort difficulty, this workout can suit a range of fitness levels. The availability of modifications and the low-impact nature make it accessible to beginners. The intermediate score is strong due to the inclusion of dumbbells, which increases exercise complexity and effort. The option to self-select dumbbell weight and adjust intensity supports its accessibility to advanced users as well. User comments indicating regular use and significant personal improvements also highlight its appeal across different fitness levels."
