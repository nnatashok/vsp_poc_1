  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.9, based on strong indicators throughout the metadata. The title suggests a focus on sleep aid with 'Breathing Routine To Help Fall Asleep,' and the tags heavily emphasize relaxation, meditation, and stress relief (e.g., 'relaxation breathing for sleep,' 'guided breathing meditation'). The description further corroborates this with mentions of 'deep relaxation,' 'stress and anxiety reduction,' and a focus on self-love, aligning strongly with restorative qualities. The channel content is described as 'sharing the power of the breath,' with intent to foster personal growth, another restorative aspect. \n\nA secondary 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is identified with a score of 0.6, given the integration of rhythmic music and continuous guided exercises ('infused with rhythmic music,' 'rhythmic music can facilitate a deeper state'). This suggests a flow aspect through the seamlessness of breath and rhythm but is less dominant than the restorative element. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are unsuitable here due to the lack of intensity or athletic focus in the workout details."
