  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this guided meditation video is 'Soothing & Restorative,' with a very high confidence level of 1.0. The video title 'Guided Meditation for Calm' and tags like 'guided meditation,' 'meditation for calm,' and 'sleep meditation' all emphasize a focus on relaxation and mental peace. The description further solidifies this spirit by stating that the meditation aims to be a 'soothing, relaxing time out to calm yourself down,' and it addresses conditions like anxiety, OCD, depression, and pain, all indicative of a restorative approach. \n\nMoreover, the video incorporates elements such as 'mindful witnessing,' 'self-hypnosis,' 'gentle background sleep music,' and 'tranquil ocean waves,' all reinforcing the calming, restorative atmosphere. The top comments, praising the video's effect on anxiety, depression, and even helping with sleep issues in pets, underline its soothing impact. Given this abundant evidence, other workout spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Flow & Rhythm,' were ruled out due to their incongruence with the video's meditative and serene objectives."
