  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is best described by 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its intense, interval-driven nature that is characteristic of HIIT workouts. The description clearly mentions 'sprint training,' 'going as hard as you can,' and '6 rounds of 30 seconds of high intensity,' which all align with the fast, explosive qualities of 'The Firestarter.' The score of 0.8 reflects strong alignment with this vibe based on explicit descriptors of explosiveness and short duration bursts. \n\nAdditionally, the workout also fits 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe, as it involves steady state intervals (90 seconds of lower intensity) interspersed within a 15-minute duration, promoting a feel-good wave of energy and gradual warm-up and cool-down phases to sustain the user through the workout. The integration of varying intensity levels suggest a steady build of energy, characteristic of 'The Endorphin Wave,' warranting a score of 0.7.\n\n'No other vibes were directly applicable as the primary focus of the workout is on high-intensity intervals rather than techniques or meditative elements, which abstract other vibes from being applicable here."
