  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled 'Virtual Run 5k | Virtual Running Videos For Treadmill | Mount Cook Hooker Valley New Zealand', explicitly mentioning 'Treadmill' and indicating the video is designed for treadmill running purposes. This is further supported by the tags such as 'treadmill running videos', 'virtual running videos for treadmill', and 'treadmill running scenery videos'. The description also aligns with treadmill usage, describing it as a virtual run experience designed for running indoors. The comments also mention using the video while running on a treadmill, confirming the primary equipment needed for this workout. Therefore, the confidence level for requiring a treadmill is very high, at 0.9."
