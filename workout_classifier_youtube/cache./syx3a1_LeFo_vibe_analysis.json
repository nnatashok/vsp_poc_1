  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of 'The Zen Flow' was assigned with high confidence. The video emphasizes mindfulness and inner peace, as evidenced by its title 'Mindfulness Meditation' and description focusing on reducing stress and enhancing calmness. The tags like 'calm', 'relaxation', and 'mind' further support this classification. The guided meditation by Tamara Levitt focuses on the practice of letting go, which aligns with the grounding and breath-centered nature of 'The Zen Flow'. Additionally, the channel's mission to promote a healthy, peaceful life through mindfulness is indicative of this vibe.\n\nThe vibe 'The Deep Recharge' also received a strong score, due to the meditation's emphasis on stress reduction and mental resetting, which are key aspects of 'The Deep Recharge'. The description and comments reflect the video's impact on resilience and emotional release, both align with a nervous system reset focus.\n\nWhile tags such as 'inspiration' and 'self-esteem' might suggest other minor elements (e.g., motivation), they do not strongly depart from the calming and restorative themes central to the chosen vibes."
