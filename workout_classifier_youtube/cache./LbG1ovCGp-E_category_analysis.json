  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Pilates' with a very high confidence level. Evidence includes the repeated mention of 'Pilates' in the title, description, and tags (e.g., \"morning pilates workout,\" \"full body pilates workout\"). The channel's focus on Pilates is strongly indicated by the creator's credentials as a Certified Pilates Instructor, as well as the significant endorsement from a Pilates teacher in the comments.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Mat,' as the description mentions performing the workout on a mat and there's an absence of equipment usage, suggested by terms such as \"at home pilates workout no equipment.\" This aligns with general floor exercises performed on an exercise mat.\n\nOther categories like 'Body weight' or 'Stretching' were considered but not chosen as the Pilates classification more specifically encapsulates the style and approach of this workout."
