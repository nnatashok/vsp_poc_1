  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit with a very high confidence of 0.95. This is evident from the title and description which emphasize stress reduction, relaxation, and gentle yoga flow. Keywords such as \"gentle\", \"flexibility\", \"stress relief\", \"soothing\", and \"full body stretch\" strongly indicate a focus on relaxation and restorative practice, typical of a soothing yoga session. Additionally, specific mention of practices like Box Breathing and mindful breathing highlights the calming and restorative objectives of this workout.\n\nThe \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit is also present, albeit to a lesser degree, with a score of 0.65. The description's use of \"gentle yoga flow\" suggests a series of smooth and continuous movements, characteristic of flow-oriented practices, with a focus on mind-body connection. This spirit is less dominant as the primary focus remains on soothing and restorative elements, rather than dynamic movement or rhythm-driven exercise. Other spirits were excluded due to the overall emphasis on relaxation and mental calming rather than intensity, athletic skill focus, or adventurous settings."
