  "title": "The Powerful Release of Letting Go!  Guided Meditation",
  "description": "This is an Original guided meditation recorded by us.    Letting go is not just about releasing attachments to material possessions or past relationships, it's also a spiritual practice that involves surrendering to the flow of life and trusting in a higher power.  It requires us to release our fears, doubts, and worries, and have faith that everything is happening for a divine reason.  Letting go allows us to connect with our true selves and the universe, and to live in a state of peace, love, and harmony.  May we all have the courage to let go of what no longer serves us and trust in the infinite wisdom of the universe.\n\nA special thank you to all our monthly supporters!  \nWe appreciate all your support and contribution to allow this channel to continue to share our guided meditations with the world.

    "I&#39;ve been suffering from a terrible broken heart. I am I&#39;m about to do everything I can to let go. Please say a prayer for me I just want to  heal. <br>Update, thank you everyone for the kind words. I needed each and everyone. That being said it was around seven months. I started to finally feel better. I did a lot of research and I had to feel my way through it and grieved fully. I will say that I didn&#39;t realize how unhappy I was even though I didn&#39;t go. I will say that I am now living the life of my dreams. Without an ending, there would not be a new beginning. I learned a lot about myself as I had to dig deeper than I have ever had to dig. I am forever grateful. Love and light. Remember the universe has a plan. Some people are just not in it.",
    "I\u2019ve come to understand that my worth isn\u2019t defined by my struggles. When anxiety had a grip on me, reading Shift Your Mind by Alexander Brooks completely changed my outlook. It gave me the tools to let go of fear and find calm within. Now, I remind myself daily that I deserve happiness, love, and inner peace.",
    "to whoever needs to hear this, it\u2019ll be okay! this is only temporary and all of your dreams will come true!\ud83c\udf40",
    "obsession,depression,anxiety,Worrying ,nervousness,detachedment is all gone and I\u2019m a new brand person with a new mindset.",
