  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Yoga' with a score of 1.0, as the title explicitly mentions 'Yoga Nidra,' which is a well-known form of yogic practice aimed at promoting relaxation and peace. The tags further reinforce this classification with repeated mentions of 'yoga nidra' and '\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u0928\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e' (yoga nidra in Hindi). The description also highlights yoga nidra meditation, indicating its core role in the video.\n\nThe 'Meditation' category is assigned a score of 0.9 based on the prominence of the term 'guided meditation' in the tags and description. The video is described as a guided meditation session designed for relaxation and peace, suggesting that meditation is a central activity alongside yoga.\n\nThere is a strong confidence level of 0.95 for these choices due to consistent and explicit references to yoga nidra and meditation throughout the metadata, with minimal ambiguity or overlap with other categories."
