  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Stretching', assigned with a score of 0.95 and high confidence of 0.9. This is based on numerous explicit indicators across the metadata. The title clearly specifies 'POST-WORKOUT STRETCH', highlighted with the intention for 'Injury Prevention & Flexibility', which aligns directly with the Stretching category. Additionally, the description emphasizes its purpose as a stretch session to 'increase your flexibility' and to 'decompress' muscles. The use of terms such as 'full-body stretches', and 'relieve tight muscles' further supports this classification. The tags #stretching and #flexibility reinforce this evidence. Comments from viewers corroborate the stretching nature of the content, describing their experiences with the stretches. No indicators suggest another category; thus, Stretching remains the sole classification."
