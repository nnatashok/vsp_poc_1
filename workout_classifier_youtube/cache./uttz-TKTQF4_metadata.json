    "What I really truly appreciate is that the video doesn&#39;t end abruptly after the guided practice does. It leaves me such a comfortable and much needed, uninterrupted space to simmer in the benefits and go a little deeper before I end. Especially with the quality of music you have, its so precious and calming. This makes such a huge difference.",
