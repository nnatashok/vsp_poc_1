  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the technique and effort difficulty, the required fitness level aligns with Beginner to Advanced. Given the workout's high-intensity description and ability to modify intensity by selecting different weights, beginners with some caution could attempt it, but it is more appropriate for those at an Intermediate level developing from consistent exercise. Advanced users, who are already used to working with HIIT and strength training, would likely find it sufficiently challenging due to the intensity."
