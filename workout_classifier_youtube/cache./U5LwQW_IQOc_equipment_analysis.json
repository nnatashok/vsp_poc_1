  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is categorized as a Pilates core workout that is performed at home. The description explicitly states that \"all you need is yourself and a mat, no equipment needed,\" which indicates that the only required equipment is a mat. This is also supported by the promotional mention in the description about a specific mat from Liforme. Given this clear mention, the confidence level for requiring a mat is very high (1.0). Additionally, Pilates workouts typically involve floor exercises that are comfortably carried out on a mat, which aligns with the typical usage of a mat in such workouts. Therefore, no other equipment is needed or suggested by the metadata."
