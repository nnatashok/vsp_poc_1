  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this video is \"Soothing & Restorative,\" with a very high confidence score of 0.9. This classification is strongly supported by the metadata, especially given the focus on meditation for stress reduction, relaxation, and personal growth. The title 'Guided Meditation for New Beginnings and Habit Change' and tags like 'relaxation', 'stress reduction', and 'healing hypnotherapy' indicate a restorative, calming focus. Additionally, the channel's dedication to providing healing and calm through meditation further supports this spirit.\n\nThe secondary spirit is \"Flow & Rhythm,\" with a moderate score of 0.5. This is due to the guided nature of the meditation, which can involve rhythmic breathing and a structured yet fluid narrative to guide the user's thoughts and emotions, as indicated by the comments noting emotional impact and visualization of future journeys. The rhythmic music mentioned ('Oxygen Garden' and 'Deliberate Thought') supports this spirit.\n\nOther spirits such as \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Structured & Disciplined\" were excluded due to the lack of any high-paced or intense elements and the informal, flexible approach to guiding personal insights and emotions rather than a regimented routine."
