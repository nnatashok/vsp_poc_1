  "title": "Box Breathing Relaxation Exercise | 5 Minutes Beginner Pace | Anxiety Reduction Pranayama Technique",
  "description": "Utilize the calming effects of Box Breathing, a stress-reducing technique utilized by the U.S. Navy SEALs. The practice is also known as \u201cresetting your breath\u201d or \"four-square breathing\" and can be highly effective for people in stressful situations.\n\nIt is not necessary that your timing perfectly matches the video example. You can take shorter or longer breaths as long as you maintain the ratio - Inhale 4, Hold 4, Exhale 4, Hold 4. Try to maintain the pattern for five minutes. The more often you practice, the more effective it becomes.\n\n\n\n// TO TRY OTHER CALM BREATHING TECHNIQUES\n\nExtended Breath-Hold Pranayama Exercises https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzK1U3HzIGbhLySSPEFe1shy9FhQiDANs\n\n4-7-8 Calm Breathing Techniques https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzK1U3HzIGbjPKtM8ZQ3nT0Spi5SI1S39\n\n\n\n//  TRY GUIDED HANDS-ON MEDITATIONS\n\nIf you would like to try meditation, I encourage you to try the Hands-On Meditation technique.

    "I can\u2019t tell you how much this short video has improved my quality of life. <br><br>I suffered an awful anxiety attack almost a month ago, and the aftershocks have persisted for weeks. They\u2019re the worst when I\u2019m in confined uncontrolled spaces, especially the passenger in an automobile or airplane. <br><br>I use this video every time before I board a bus or ride in a car",
    "Perfect and simple.  No visualising or anything like that and easy to follow along.  Thank you.",
    "3 days back needed to call 911, my anxiety took me down and resulted in skipping my breaths! yes, I forget to breathe sometimes! For the last two days, I have been doing box breathing and hey it helps! I found this particular video very helpful cause of its blue underwater color and of course the box! thank you, nice work, please keep it up!",
    "I have BPD and this video has helped me so much when I have a rage episode or panic attack. Thank you so much!",
    "Totally recommend this if ur nerves are on edge and if ur feeling restless~ his voice is so soothing and it\u2019s actually simple and easy to follow~"
