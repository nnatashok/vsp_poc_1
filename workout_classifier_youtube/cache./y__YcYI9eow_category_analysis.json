  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video 'Morning Shred Routine - Burn Belly Fat' from channel Adam Frater is classified primarily into 'Body weight' and 'Calisthenics' categories. The title and tags such as 'home workout', 'no equipment', and 'bodyweight' indicate exercises using one's own body weight. The description emphasizes building a physique without equipment and highlights calisthenics techniques, aligning with the calisthenics category. Comments further confirm calisthenics as users report following calisthenics programs and exercises such as pushups, squats, and planks, which are typical bodyweight movements. The repeated mention of getting 'shredded' through these methods suggests the video's focus on bodyweight and calisthenics. The high confidence (0.85) stems from consistent explicit mentions across metadata supporting these classifications, with a balanced score between body weight and calisthenics (0.7) due to the integrated nature of the exercises."
