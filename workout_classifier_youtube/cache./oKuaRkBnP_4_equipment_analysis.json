  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled '15 Minute Beginner Workout: Treadmill Virtual Scenery (Slow Jog/Fast Walk)' explicitly mentions the use of a treadmill in both the title and description, as well as in the tags like 'virtual treadmill' and 'jogging'. The description also specifies that this is 15 minutes of virtual scenery intended for treadmill use with the pace being a slow jog or fast walk. The very high confidence score of 0.9 reflects the clear indication that a treadmill is central to the workout since it is designed for viewing while performing exercises on a treadmill. There is no indication of any other equipment being required."
