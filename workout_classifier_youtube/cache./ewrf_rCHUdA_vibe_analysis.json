  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe 'The Firestarter' was chosen with a high confidence score of 0.9 due to the intensity, time-based interval structure, and explosive energy highlighted by the title 'HIIT Cardio Indoor Cycling' and description that mentions 'short sharp workout' and 'max' intensity sessions, aligning with fast, explosive workouts like Tabata.\n\nThe secondary vibe, 'The Meditative Grind', scored 0.7. This is supported by the repetitive, routine nature of cycling workouts, suggested by terms like 'indoor cycling' and 'spin class'. The extended session of focused effort over time also reflects a meditative, grind-like quality.\n\n'Endorphin Wave' scored 0.6 due to the workout's steady build and intense effort leading to a rewarding high afterward. Comments referencing challenging yet satisfying experiences after the workout ('my legs were dead and my ego was crushed') suggest an elevated energy typical of this vibe.\n\nNo other vibes were particularly applicable given the explicit emphasis on short-duration, high-intensity cycling."
