  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as indicated by the title and description emphasizing healing, inner peace, and meditation. The use of the 432 Hz and 111 Hz frequencies is highlighted as promoting relaxation and deep meditation, which are key characteristics of the Soothing & Restorative spirit. This is further supported by comments from viewers who mention the video helping with relaxation and stress alleviation, with one user mentioning its role in recovery from a heart attack.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also slightly relevant, given the smooth, continuous nature of meditation music and the mind-body connection it fosters; however, it is not as strongly emphasized as the Soothing & Restorative qualities. Therefore, it receives a lower score of 0.3.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are not applicable here, as the video's focus is not on high intensity, methodical structure, sports performance, or outdoor activity."
