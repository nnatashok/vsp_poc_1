  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is clearly intended to be a no-equipment, bodyweight workout. The title explicitly states \"No Equipment\" which is reinforced in the description where it mentions \"Follow along from home without the need for any equipment.\" The tags such as \"no equipment\" and \"workout at home\" further emphasize this nature. Also, the detailed description of the workout structure lists \"No Equipment & No Repeat\" making it apparent that no specialized equipment is required to perform this workout. The comments do not provide any additional insights suggesting otherwise. Thus, the confidence is very high (0.8-1.0) that the workout does not require any equipment, confirming it as a bodyweight-only workout."
