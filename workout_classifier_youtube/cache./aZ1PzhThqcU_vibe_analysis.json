  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is closely aligned with 'The Zen Flow' and 'The Reboot Workout' vibes. 'The Zen Flow' vibe is strongly indicated by the emphasis on breath-centered, deep passive stretches designed to improve mobility and release tension, as described in the video description which highlights 'slow down', 'hold your stretches for longer', and 'use breathing techniques'. The terms 'grounding', 'relaxing', and 'educational yet grounding' from the comments further support this classification. The score of 0.8 for 'The Zen Flow' reflects the strong alignment with these characteristics and user feedback.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Reboot Workout' vibe is applicable due to the focus on total-body refreshment and flexibility improvement, as suggested by phrases like 'full body flexibility', 'simple and pragmatic', and 'post-exercise practice' in the description. The video provides a routine that aims to relieve stiffness and promote recovery, matching the characteristics of a workout intended for recharging the body. The score of 0.7 reflects the supportive but secondary nature of this vibe. \n\nOther potential vibes, like 'The Meditative Grind', were not applicable as the workout focuses on flexibility and grounding rather than endurance. Overall, the video's focus and viewer feedback indicate a grounding, restorative experience."
