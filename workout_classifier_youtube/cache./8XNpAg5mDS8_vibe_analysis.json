  "vibesExplanation": "The chosen vibe descriptors were selected based on the metadata's strong emphasis on relaxation, relief, and gentle movement. \"The Reboot Workout\" received the highest score of 0.9 due to the focus on a \"gentle stretching routine\" for \"relaxation, flexibility & stress relief,\" as cited in both the title and description, aligned with the purpose of rejuvenating the body. \"The Zen Flow\" scored 0.8, supported by the slow-paced, \"no talking\" nature, which suggests a grounding and calming practice, complemented by relaxing music\u2014a characteristic of a breath-centered and unhurried session. \"The Deep Recharge\" received a score of 0.7, drawn from user comments highlighting emotional stress relief and a calming effect, satisfying the need for an ultra-gentle reset. Vibes such as \"The Meditative Grind\" and \"The Comfort Moves\" were not applicable due to the focus on flexibility rather than endurance or comfort-first movements."
