  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is focused on treadmill running form for beginners, as indicated by the title and description. Running form analysis, while important, involves straightforward actions like adjusting posture and cadence, making it suitable for beginners. The use of a treadmill may involve some coordination, suggesting a minor relevance for intermediate users. Overall, this is a beginner-oriented technique with minimal complexity, hence the high score for 'Beginner' and slight consideration for 'Intermediate'.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video's focus on treadmill running form for beginners implies low physical demands, aligning with 'Light' effort difficulty due to low energy expenditure from form adjustment rather than intense exercise. The duration (under 10 minutes) further supports this as 'Light'. The potential introduction of running on a treadmill might slightly elevate effort difficulty to 'Moderate', considering some beginners may find increasing speed or sustaining posture slightly challenging, hence its inclusion with a lower score.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the beginner focus on treadmill running form, the workout is primarily designed for users new to exercise ('Beginner'), supported by the frequent mention of beginner keywords in tags and comments expressing first-time running experiences. There's slight relevance for 'Intermediate' due to treadmill use requiring some basic fitness familiarity. However, the video's short duration and focus on form suggest low physical demand, justifying the primary 'Beginner' classification with a minor inclusion for 'Intermediate' to account for potential adaptability as users gain familiarity."
