  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this video is 'The Zen Flow', evidenced by keywords such as 'meditation', 'peace', 'relax', and 'anxiety free' in both the description and title. The focus on a 'stress free, anxiety free, worry free life' with instructions to 'sit back, relax' suggests a grounding, breath-centered experience typical of The Zen Flow. This is reinforced by the channel's focus on meditation and spiritual guidance. The score is set at 0.9 for very high confidence given the explicit focus on meditation and relaxation.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Deep Recharge' vibe is fitting, as the guided meditation aims to provide a 'stress free' experience, assisting viewers in resetting their emotional and mental state, as indicated by the channel's description and viewers' comments expressing gratitude for mental clarity and peace. This vibe scores 0.85 due to significant features of mental relaxation and nervous system reset being central to the meditation's goals.\n\n'Lastly, 'The Reboot Workout' was considered to a lesser degree (0.6 score) due to the focus on providing a 'total-body refresh' through mental relaxation, which hints slightly at a refreshing experience, though the primary focus is still on mental and spiritual peace rather than physical refreshment.\n\nOther potential vibes such as 'The Mindful Walk' or 'The Sleep Prep' were excluded due to the absence of elements like physical activity or specific focus on sleep preparation."
