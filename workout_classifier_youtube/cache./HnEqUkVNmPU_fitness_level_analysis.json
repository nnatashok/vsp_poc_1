  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The metadata suggests that the technique difficulty of this yoga workout leans towards beginner to intermediate levels. The tags and descriptions use phrases like 'at home yoga', '30 day yoga journey', and 'free yoga videos', emphasizing accessibility. While the description mentions 'adding more vocabulary and depth', comments and channel content focus on a welcoming approach suitable for all levels. This indicates some movements may require basic coordination and mindfulness, suitable for both beginners and intermediates.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty of the workout is skewed towards a light level, with a moderate element present mainly due to the 28-minute duration. Phrasing like 'feeling complete, more true', and 'more capable of loving ourselves' indicates a focus on mindfulness and breath rather than intense physical exertion. The comment about a 'beautiful flow' also suggests that while there might be some continuous movement, it's not overly strenuous, making it primarily suitable for a restful, calming practice that involves light to moderate effort.",

Beginners can likely keep up with basic modifications and the supportive channel message encourages all levels.

The combination of technique and effort difficulty, along with user engagement from those new to regular practice, supports this inclusive range."
