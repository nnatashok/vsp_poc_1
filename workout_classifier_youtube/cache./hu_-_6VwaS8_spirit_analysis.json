  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.8, due to its focus on improving posture, relieving back pain, and suggesting consistent, mindful practice. These elements align with a restorative nature, supporting recovery and healing through gentle movement. The selected poses (cat and cow, cobra, etc.) are typical for low-intensity, alignment-focused sessions designed to ease tension and promote spinal health, as noted in the description and tags.\n\nA secondary classification is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.6, emphasized by the inclusion of flowing yoga poses such as 'cat and cow' and 'downward dog,' which suggest a movement rhythm consistent with yoga practices, and comments highlighting a mood-uplifting experience. The inclusion of music-driven practices, typical of yoga, contributes to this classification, although less dominant than the restorative elements. \n\nOther spirits were excluded due to the lack of high-intensity or outdoor elements and the methodical, gentle nature of yoga, which doesn't typically match the 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' categories."
