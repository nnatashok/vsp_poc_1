  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title explicitly states 'No Equipment,' and the description confirms this by emphasizing it as a bodyweight workout achievable at home without any equipment. Tags such as 'no equipment calisthenics' and 'calisthenics no equipment' further reinforce the absence of required equipment. Comments from viewers, along with the overall focus on calisthenics, a discipline known for using body weight rather than external equipment, suggest that this workout is indeed designed to be performed without any additional gear. Thus, the workout requires no equipment, aligning with the video's consistent emphasis on bodyweight-only exercises."
