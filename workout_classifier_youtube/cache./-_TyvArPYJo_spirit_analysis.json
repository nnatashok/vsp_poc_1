  "spiritsExplanation": "The video predominantly falls under the 'Structured & Disciplined' workout spirit due to its methodical approach to strength training. This is evidenced by the detailed exercise list, the structured format of 12 exercises repeated twice, and the emphasis on specific muscle groups (biceps, triceps, shoulders) with predefined work and rest intervals (45 seconds work, 30 seconds rest). The instructions to select a challenging weight for the entire duration also emphasize a disciplined training protocol, meriting a high score of 0.85.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit is also present, indicated by phrases in the description such as \"push you outside of your comfort zone\" and \"lift heavy.\" These suggest an emphasis on intensity and effort, which aligns with high-energy training. However, since the focus is also heavily on form and specific muscle targeting, this spirit receives a slightly lower score of 0.7.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were dismissed due to the lack of emphasis on smooth coordinated movements or relaxation and recovery aspects. 'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded as the workout is not sport-specific nor conducted in an outdoor setting."
