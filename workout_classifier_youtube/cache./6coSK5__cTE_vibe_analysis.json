  "vibesExplanation": "The video, titled '20 Min Cardio Workout To Reduce Belly Fat And Get A Flat Stomach,' emphasizes a steady, aerobic cardio session designed to burn belly fat. The workout's duration of 20 minutes fits the vibe of 'The Endorphin Wave,' which is characterized by elevated energy and a feel-good movement that builds steadily over the session. The description mentions raising heart levels for a prolonged time to burn fat, suggesting a consistent and moderate intensity that aligns with the endorphin-related experience of this vibe. The comments from viewers about repeated usage and sustained results further support this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, the workout includes an element of fun and liveliness, aligning with 'The Groove Session' vibe. The description invites viewers to an 'exciting cardio session,' indicating an enjoyable and engaging experience. Although less focus is given to expressive movement, the upbeat, inviting tone suggests a mild presence of groovy and enjoyable aspects, hence a score of 0.6.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Warrior Workout,' which suggests a high-intensity regime, are less applicable, as neither the title nor description implies an extremely vigorous session."
