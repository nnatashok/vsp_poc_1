  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is explicitly focused on calisthenics, as indicated by both the title 'Calisthenics For Beginners' and the description outlining a workout routine for beginners in calisthenics. The top comment further substantiates this by listing exercises typical of a calisthenics routine\u2014such as pushups, pull-ups, and planks\u2014which are also body weight exercises. Given the emphasis on calisthenics in both the initial presentation and viewer feedback, the score for \"Calisthenics\" is at 1.0 for its defining presence. The inclusion of common body weight exercises suggests a strong relationship to the \"Body weight\" category; therefore, it receives a score of 0.7, reflecting its evident but secondary role. No other categories apply as the focus is on body weight-based strength training rather than cardio, flexibility, or equipment-based workouts."
