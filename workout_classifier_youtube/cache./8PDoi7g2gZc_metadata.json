    "I am genuinely so surprised about how effective a 20 minute exercise can be! I\u2019ve lost 3kgs and barely even changed my diet, and I\u2019m only doing about 2 to 3 times a week \ud83e\udd2f",
    "It felt like I was barely started when the 20 mins lapsed but the sweat that rolled off me tells me that this is some genuine workout session. Love it. More of these workouts, please. Thank you. \u2763",
    "I love these 20 minute workouts! It&#39;s perfect for when I don&#39;t have enough time. I cannot get enough of the 20-30 minute full body videos. Perfect for a busy AF single mom. Thank you girl!",
    "I&#39;m 61 and was able to do this today (first time) with 10 lb. dumbbells.  Oh.....&quot;sweat is your fat, crying!&quot; \ud83e\udd23  And mine cried a lot!  Outstanding - totally enjoyed this and look forward to doing more of your workouts.",
    "It is such a gift to do your workouts. The best thing is your calm demeanour. I&#39;m so sick of being yelled at or super high energy videos. Thank you!"
