  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a guided meditation for sleep and relaxation, with soothing rain sounds, and does not involve any physical workout or exercise that would require fitness equipment. The description suggests finding a quiet space and putting on headphones, which are not classified as fitness equipment. Additionally, there are no mentions of any fitness tools or props like mats, chairs, or yoga blocks in the title, description, tags, or comments. Therefore, it is determined that no physical fitness equipment is necessary for this meditation session, and the focus is entirely on auditory guidance and environmental soundscapes for relaxation purposes."
