  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is best classified under \"Flow & Rhythm\" with a score of 0.8 because it emphasizes smooth movement patterns and a mind-body connection, as indicated by terms like \"morning yoga flow\" and \"breath-centric morning flow\" in the title and description. The practice is designed to \"cultivate a peaceful mind and strong body,\" advocating a rhythmical and comprehensive engagement of the body and mind. The channel's focus on yoga practice further supports this classification.\n\n\"Soothing & Restorative\" is also applicable, scoring 0.6, due to the session's emphasis on starting the day peacefully and the mention of benefits such as \"peaceful inner feelings,\" alongside soothing elements, as reflected in participant comments recounting emotional experiences and feelings of community support.\n\nOther spirits such as \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Sport & Agility\" are excluded considering the video's focus on a gentle, flowing yoga practice rather than vigorous exercise or sports-related drills."
