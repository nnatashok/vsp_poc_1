  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This workout features simple, straightforward stretches such as lumbar and thoracic rotation, cat/cow, and hip flexor stretches. These exercises are basics often used in beginner routines and require minimal coordination, making them broadly accessible. While some exercises like the hip flexor and thoracic rotation stretches might require moderate flexibility and body awareness, the overall routine is intended to be gentle and easy to follow, as noted by user comments about its effectiveness and simplicity. The inclusion of more complex stretches slightly raises the intermediate score but does not significantly shift it beyond beginner.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily composed of static and dynamic stretches aimed at improving flexibility and mobility, rather than enhancing cardiovascular fitness or strength, leading to a 'Light' classification. The short duration (9 minutes) and focus on morning stiffness alleviation suggest minimal energy expenditure and effort required. User comments endorse this by describing the routine as easy to follow and effective for pain relief. The moderate score is slightly considered due to engaging stretches which might challenge someone who use limited range of motion.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "This stretching routine is almost universally suitable for beginners, as emphasized by the video's focus on relieving morning stiffness and aches using simple stretches. The instructor\u2019s background as a physical therapist suggests the exercises are tailored for accessibility and safety. The light effort requirement and basic technique difficulty support a primary classification of 'Beginner'. An 'Intermediate' classification is possible for users seeking more flexibility improvements or dealing with more severe stiffness, given a few stretches require modest range of motion adjustments."
