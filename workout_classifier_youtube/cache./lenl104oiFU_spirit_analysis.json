  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout video is 'Soothing & Restorative', with a strong focus on lowering blood pressure, a key indicator of stress. The video emphasizes a \"low impact\" routine, designed to manage blood pressure, indicating its restorative nature. The content strongly suggests a gentle, health-oriented approach with phrases like 'reduce stress,' 'safe to do multiple times,' and 'natural way.' This aligns with the restorative spirit of exercises designed to calm and relax the body, supported by user comments sharing experiences of health improvements. The score of 0.9 reflects the very high confidence in this classification due to explicit focus on health and recovery.\n\nA secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm', is identified with a moderate score of 0.6. The workout consists of 10 different exercises performed in a continuous, rhythmic sequence (\"performed for one minute sequenced back to back\"), which suggests a flow-oriented session. Although less dominant than the restorative element, this spirit is noticeable through the smooth progression and coordination required throughout the workout. Other spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility', were excluded due to a lack of emphasis on intensity, athletic performance, or competitive skills."
