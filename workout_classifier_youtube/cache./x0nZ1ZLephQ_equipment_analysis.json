  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "Based on the video metadata, the workout appears to require no specific equipment and is intended to be a bodyweight meditation practice. The title and description highlight this as a guided meditation session for mental balance and grounding, with no explicit mention of any physical equipment needed. The tags emphasize meditation, guided meditation, and yoga, but do not reference any equipment. Additionally, comments mention arriving on a mat, but this suggests personal preference rather than necessity specifically for this session. Therefore, it can be concluded with high confidence that this session is designed to be performed without the need for physical fitness equipment, focusing purely on meditation and mental exercises."
