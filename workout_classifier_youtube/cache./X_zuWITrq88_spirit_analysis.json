  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' based on the metadata. The title and description emphasize a 'stretch and strength routine,' with phrases like 'full body stretch' and 'relaxing stretch combined with some gentle holds and dynamic moves' reflecting a focus on smooth, continuous movement and a relaxation-oriented approach. The presence of music with a beat, as mentioned in the comments, supports 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a score of 0.7 due to the musical element enhancing coordination and rhythm. 'Soothing & Restorative' receives a score of 0.8, reflecting the emphasis on relaxation, recovery, and flexibility. The frequent reference to stretching and the relaxing, gentle nature of the workout suggests a strong inclination towards recovery and stress reduction. 'Structured & Disciplined' and other spirits are less applicable here, as the routine lacks explicit intensity, sports focus, or adventure elements."
