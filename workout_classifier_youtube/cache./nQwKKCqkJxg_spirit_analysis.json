  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit for this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative', scoring 0.9. The title and description emphasize a 'gentle', 'slow', and 'relaxing' practice designed to help participants feel 'relaxed and rejuvenated'. Comments highlight its accessibility for people of all ages and fitness levels, emphasizing that it is gentle and supportive for beginners. These elements strongly indicate a focus on gentle, restorative energy ideal for stress reduction and recovery.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm', which scores 0.6. While the practice is seated and slow, the description mentions 'moving and stretching your entire body' and 'connecting with your breath', implying a continuous, rhythmic flow often found in yoga practices that promote a mind-body connection. Although the pace is gentle, it supports a rhythmic and harmonious movement pattern, justifying the inclusion of this spirit.\n\nOther spirits were considered but ultimately excluded due to the absence of dynamic or intense movement (excluding 'High-Energy & Intense'), lack of structured training protocols ('Structured & Disciplined'), absence of sports-focused skills ('Sport & Agility'), and no use of outdoor elements ('Outdoor & Adventure')."
