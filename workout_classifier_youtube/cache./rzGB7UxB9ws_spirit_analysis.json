  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative,' which is evident from the focus on gentle, beginner-friendly stretches for back pain relief, as mentioned in the title and description. Phrases like \"gentle, beginner-friendly\" and \"ease some of the tension/tightness\" underscore the restorative nature of this yoga session. The score of 0.9 reflects strong confidence in this classification. \n\nAdditionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is a relevant spirit due to the use of terms like 'yoga flow spine' and 'vinyasa yoga' in the tags, suggesting a rhythmic aspect to the movement sequence. The description's mention of \"slowly lengthen our spine & hips\" also supports this, garnering a score of 0.6.\n\nFinally, there is a minor element of 'Structured & Disciplined,' given the specific focus on addressing lower back pain and the progressive nature of following a yoga routine, earning it a score of 0.4. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the non-intense, non-athletic nature of the session."
