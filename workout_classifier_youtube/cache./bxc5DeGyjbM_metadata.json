    "Drop a comment and let us know if this workout was helpful with the audio cues! \ud83d\udd25",
    "Thanks!",
    "The audio cues are so helpful - all these years I never thought to tense up my abs and glutes while working arms and legs.  Thanks for setting me right!",
    "Starting the 30 day Fresh Start Challenge and this is the first workout in the programme! Just completed it now and feeling really proud of myself \ud83d\ude0a",
    "Great workout! I love the variety you offer. I am 59 years old and started your workouts 2 months ago. I started with the 20-minute no weights and am now up to 30 minutes with weights 3xs a week. I am almost ready to increase my weights. I am using 5 and 10s but am ready for more! I enjoy the no-nonsense workouts, and you both are the most charming and insightful fitness couple out there\u2764\ud83d\ude0a."
