  "vibesExplanation": "The video is best classified under 'The Reboot Workout' vibe due to its focus on a low-stress, total-body refresh through stretching. The title explicitly mentions 'Full Body Stretch Routine' and 'Beginner Friendly,' suggesting a gentle approach suitable for releasing muscle tightness and enhancing flexibility. The description encourages relaxation and emphasizes flexibility and mobility, which resonates strongly with the 'Reboot' theme, scoring a high 0.9 for this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Zen Flow' vibe is also applicable due to the calming and grounding nature of a stretch routine. The metadata indicates an unhurried, breath-centered experience that aligns with a 'Zen Flow,' especially considering the comment about it being a morning routine to start a wellness journey. This suggests a mindful, intentional experience, earning it a score of 0.8. Other vibes such as 'The Groove Session' or 'The Warrior Workout' were excluded due to the absence of rhythm-based or high-intensity elements in the workout."
