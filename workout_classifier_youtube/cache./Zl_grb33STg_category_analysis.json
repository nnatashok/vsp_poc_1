  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is \"Weight workout\" with a very high confidence (score 0.9). This is due to the explicit focus on how to enhance calorie burning during weight lifting sessions. The video discusses adjusting weights and reps, using compound exercises, and maintaining a high intensity, all consistent with weight training. The video tags such as 'weight', 'burn fat with weight training', and 'cardio vs weight training' further reinforce this classification, as does the explanation in the description that focuses on resistance training's role in fat loss and muscle maintenance.\n\nA secondary category of \"Body weight\" has been assigned with moderate confidence (score 0.4). While the primary emphasis is on weight training, there is an element of using bodyweight exercises implicitly in the discussion of compound exercises and maximizing muscle use, although this is not the central focus.\n\n\"HIIT\" was considered but excluded as the video does not indicate interval training structures. Other categories like \"Mat\", \"Pilates\", or \"Cardio\" do not apply due to the specific focus on weight-based exercises."
