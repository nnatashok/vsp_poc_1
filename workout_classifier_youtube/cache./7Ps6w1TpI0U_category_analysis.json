  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under the 'Pilates' category with a very high confidence level of 0.95 due to multiple explicit indicators in the metadata. The title explicitly describes it as a '30 MIN PILATES | At-Home Full Body Workout (No Equipment)', and the tags consistently emphasize 'pilates', 'full body pilates', and 'at-home workout', strongly confirming the Pilates focus. The channel profile also highlights the creator as a certified Pilates instructor, further supporting this category choice.\n\nAdditionally, a 'Mat' categorization is relevant, scored at 0.7, because Pilates is typically performed on a mat using bodyweight exercises, as indicated by the 'no equipment' detail in the title and description. The description reinforces this by mentioning it as a 'tone and sculpt' workout suitable for doing at home without any equipment. User comments also confirm the mat-based nature by expressing enjoyment of the full body engagement during the Pilates routine. Other categories were excluded due to a lack of indicators for alternative equipment or style beyond Pilates and general mat exercises."
