  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as predominantly 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.95 due to its focus on relaxation, anxiety relief, and calming the nervous system. The title mentions 'Calm Breathing Exercise' and 'Maximum Relaxation', the description emphasizes deep relaxation and targeting stress and anxiety, and tags like 'relieve stress', 'anxiety relief', and 'to relax or fall asleep' further reinforce this classification. Comments describe feelings of calmness and reduced anxiety after participation, which aligns with restorative qualities. Additionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is assigned a score of 0.65, reflecting the breathing technique's inherent rhythmic pace (4-7-8 pattern) which encourages smooth, continuous breathing cycles, promoting coordination between breath and relaxation. The metadata suggests minimal intensity or structured progression, which rules out other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined.' The high confidence level is due to explicit and consistent references throughout the metadata."
