  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit 'Soothing & Restorative' is indicated by the title and description, emphasizing a 'LAZY WORKOUT' and 'fat-burning exercise for when you need to burn those calories on your lazy days'. The focus on night-time, easy accessibility, and rest intervals between exercises further supports this classification, assigning it a score of 0.65 due to its emphasis on gentle movement and relaxation as opposed to high-intensity exercise. The structure of the workout, with detailed exercises and timecodes, suggests a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. This is reinforced by the organized time table and specific exercises like 'Baby Pose' and 'Cat And Cow', scoring it a 0.6. 'Flow & Rhythm' receives a mild score of 0.4 due to the continuous phase of exercises strung together, albeit at a slower pace and with intervals, contributing to a cohesive workout flow. High-energy elements are largely absent, which excludes 'High-Energy & Intense'. The workout's indoor setting eliminates 'Outdoor & Adventure', and there is no sports specificity to warrant 'Sport & Agility' classification."
