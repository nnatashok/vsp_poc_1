  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is most accurately classified under \"Meditation,\" receiving a score of 1.0 due to explicit emphasis on guided meditation practices throughout the metadata. The title, \"Heal Your Body: Spoken Guided Meditation For Pain & Sickness,\" clearly indicates a focus on meditation. Additionally, the tags such as 'guided meditation', 'heal your body', and 'pain relief meditation' reinforce this classification. \n\nThe channel's focus on sleep meditation and relaxation, along with the provided description, further supports this categorization.\n\nA mild score of 0.3 is assigned to \"Breathing exercises\" due to the mention in the top comments that users sometimes engage in inhaling and exhaling, although the primary activity remains meditation-focused. The video lacks explicit indicators related to structured breathing exercises in its description or tags, which limits the confidence for a higher score in the \"Breathing exercises\" category.\n\nOther categories such as \"Yoga,\" \"Stretching,\" or \"Body weight\" were excluded as there is no evidence of physical movements or activities beyond the meditative focus."
