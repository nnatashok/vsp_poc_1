  "description": "Looking for a HIIT workout on the treadmill TO BURN SOME FAT!? Try this Insane 30 Minute Treadmill Workout with Dr. Kevin Sarich, DC. #HIIT #HIITWorkout #Treadmill\n\nRunning on the treadmill can be easier than running outdoors, for a variety of good reasons. Treadmills give you complete control, enabling you to adjust the speed, incline, warm-up period, cool-down period, and amount of energy you expend. \n\nI recommend you try this 30 minute treadmill workout to take your fitness to the next level!\n\nI will be your own personal fitness instructor, motivating you to the very end of the treadmill workout!\n\nHIIT workouts - known as High Intensity Interval Training, are the most effective way to burn fat in the shortest amount of time possible. However, most people don't utilize this type of workout enough. \n\nIt's recommend to perform a 10-30 minute HIIT workout 2-3 times a week, with 24 hour rest in between HIIT workouts, in addition to other variety of fitness activities. \n\nThis treadmill workout video is 30 minutes of sprint training, going as hard as you can for 12 rounds of 30 seconds, spaced with 90 seconds of low intensity. \n\nWe start the treadmill workout with a 5 minute warm-up and finish the workout with a 3 minute cool-down. Please make sure you do both to reduce risk or injury! \n\n\nTo learn more visit:\nhttps://www.abundantyouchiro.com/ - Holistic Wellness Center Columbus, Ohio\nhttps://abundantyou.com/ - Natural Health Made Easy Blog\nhttps://askdrkevin.com/ - Ask Dr. Kevin a question!\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nCheck out our NEWEST killer HIIT video done on any type of static bike: \"HIIT Workout - Insane 25 Minute Spin Bike Workout\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_BlExYIimM\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",
