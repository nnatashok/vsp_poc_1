  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is classified primarily as 'Beginner' given that the video focuses on a 'gentle full body stretch,' which indicates simple movements suitable for beginners. The description and tags emphasize 'beginner stretches,' 'gentle stretches,' and a 'gentle stretch routine,' further supporting this classification. Additionally, user comments reflect a perception of ease and accessibility. The intermediate score is assigned considering that some elements of Pilates can require basic coordination and awareness, but the overall presentation leans towards simplicity. Advanced is minimally considered due to the instructor's potential incorporation of more mindful engagement common in Pilates.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.95,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as 'Light' because the workout is titled as a 'gentle full body stretch,' explicitly suggesting low physical exertion. The description speaks to a routine that 'leaves you feeling relaxed, rejuvenated,' indicating very low intensity. The short duration of 15 minutes, combined with user comments appreciating the gentleness, aligns with a workout that would not significantly challenge cardiovascular or muscular endurance. Therefore, this routine is well within the 'Light' category.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner' due to the gentle nature of the stretching routine, as indicated in the title, description, and the tags. However, an 'Intermediate' fitness level is additionally acknowledged since the use of Pilates techniques may introduce basic elements of body awareness and proprioception, albeit still manageable for most beginners. An 'Advanced' score is slightly considered due to the overall emphasis on body control in Pilates, even in a light setting, suggesting advanced participants might find value as a recovery or cool-down activity. The metadata consistently supports a beginner-friendly structure with slight possible relevance to higher fitness levels in terms of mindfulness."
