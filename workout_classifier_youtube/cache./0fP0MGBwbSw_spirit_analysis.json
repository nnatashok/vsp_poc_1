  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as 'Sport & Agility' with a score of 0.8, reflecting its clear focus on improving golf-specific skills and mobility, which are vital for athletic performance. The tags such as 'golf mobility', 'mobility for golf swing', and the emphasis on hip and spinal flexibility denote a workout aiming at enhancing sport-specific agility and functionality. Comments further confirm its utility in improving golf performance.\n\nAdditionally, 'Structured & Disciplined' is assigned with a score of 0.75, indicating the methodical and progressive approach required for such a specific type of mobility training. The video's 'follow along' nature suggests a structured format necessary for precise execution, highlighted by terms like 'mobility routine' and 'program', suggesting a regimented and consistent practice aimed at gradual improvement.\n\nThe absence of high-intensity descriptions or nature-based elements excludes spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Outdoor & Adventure'. The restorative aspect is minimized as the workout is performance-focused, not primarily relaxation-centered."
