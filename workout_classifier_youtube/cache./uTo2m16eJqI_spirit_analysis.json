  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the workout is 'High-Energy & Intense,' as explicitly indicated by the title 'INTENSE 10 MINUTE FAT MELTING HIIT CARDIO WORKOUT' and the description that emphasizes speed, high effort, and continuous movement with minimal breaks. The structured approach of having 50 seconds on and 10 seconds off further supports this classification. Many comments and the description itself highlight the vigorous pace and demand of the session, perfect for quick calorie burning and raised heart rate, justifying a score of 1.0.\n\nA secondary spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm' is moderately present, indicated by continuous movement and the pacing of exercises mentioned in the description, but does not dominate. There's an emphasis on rhythm and following along with the instructor ('as your virtual trainer'), suggesting elements of flow and coordination, giving it a score of 0.4.\n\nOther spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to the intense indoor cardio nature focused on fat burning and high energy."
