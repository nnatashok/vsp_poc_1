  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises in this workout, such as arm circles, downward punches, and punches, are simple in nature, suggesting a beginner level of technique difficulty. However, the inclusion of moves like pike push-ups and plank slaps indicates a slightly higher complexity, warranting an intermediate score as well. Overall, the movements do not require advanced coordination or balance, keeping the primary focus on execution with basic form.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 30 minutes long and described as 'highly intensive,' aiming to burn upper body fat. Frequent rest periods between exercises indicate a moderate effort required. However, the combination of movements across the workout's entire duration, particularly with minimal equipment, can pose a challenge for less conditioned individuals, justifying a supplementary challenging score.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique difficulty suggests a beginner to intermediate range. The effort, being moderate with some challenging aspects, aligns with intermediate to advanced levels, especially considering the workout duration of over 20 minutes. Given the potential for exercise modifications and the general home-fitness focus of the channel, multiple fitness levels from beginner to advanced can be reasonably assigned."
