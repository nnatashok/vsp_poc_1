  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"Belly breathing exercise: Calming the body and mind,\" published by the Indiana University School of Medicine, focuses on teaching a belly breathing exercise intended to relieve stress and anxiety, particularly in children with chronic diseases. The description emphasizes that this exercise can be done 'anywhere at any time,' suggesting that no equipment is necessary. The simplicity of the exercise is highlighted in both the description and viewer comments, which mention the calming effect of the video and the ease of performing the breathing technique. There is no mention of any specific equipment in the title, description, or comments, and the nature of the exercise does not require any additional tools. Therefore, the workout appears to be focused on bodyweight only, specifically a breathing technique, and does not require any fitness equipment."
