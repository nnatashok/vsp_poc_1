  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit assigned to this workout is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.8. This is indicated by the intermediate Pilates focus, emphasizing continuous, coordinated full-body movements as implied by terms like 'full body workout' and 'flow'. The presence of music, as appreciated by the comments, suggests a rhythmic and enjoyable pacing that aligns with this spirit. The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also strongly represented with a score of 0.7. User comments highlight mental health benefits, and the instructor's gentle approach is noted, suggesting a calming, stress-reducing experience. The encouragement to 'listen to your body' reinforces this focus. Finally, 'Structured & Disciplined' is present with a moderate score of 0.5 due to the structured nature of Pilates and the methodical, guided aspect led by a certified instructor, ensuring precise technique and progression. The lack of high-intensity cues and the emphasis on enjoyment over intensity excludes the 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' spirits. 'Outdoor & Adventure' is excluded due to the at-home, indoor setting."
