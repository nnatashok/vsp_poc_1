  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout video is 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.9. This is evidenced by the detailed listing of exercises and progressions in the comments, such as pull-ups, leg raises, and dips, which indicates a methodical approach to calisthenics, focusing on technical precision and progression. The video is part of the THENX channel, which offers a systematic approach to calisthenics, further supporting this classification. Additionally, the structured mention of secret techniques and step-by-step tutorials in the description reinforces this spirit. \n\nThe secondary spirit is 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.6. The video includes exercises that are physically demanding, like muscle-ups and jumping dips, which require significant effort and intensity. The phrase 'Unleash the Athlete in you' and references to 'burn fat' and 'big arms' also suggest a high-energy approach to the workout. However, since the focus is more on precise training than pure intensity, the score reflects this balance.\n\nOther spirits are not applicable as the session does not emphasize flow, relaxation, sports specificity, or outdoor elements."
