  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled '30 Minute Rhythm Cycling Class - Intermediate Dance Ride', which strongly suggests that it is a cycling workout. The title explicitly includes 'Cycling', indicating the use of a bike. Additionally, the channel description, 'THE ULTIMATE RHYTHM CYCLING EXPERIENCE', and comments such as 'I just have static bicycle at home' and 'changed my spin game' imply the workout is on a stationary exercise bike, common for rhythm cycling classes. Considering this evidence, Exercise bike has a very high confidence score of 0.9, as it is essential for performing the workout effectively."
