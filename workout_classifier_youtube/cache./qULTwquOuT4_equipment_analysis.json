  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled \"BEGINNER FLEXIBILITY ROUTINE (Stretches for the Inflexible),\" and is focused on stretching exercises, which typically require a comfortable surface to perform floor-based stretches. The description explicitly mentions \"THE MAT I USE\" and provides a link for purchasing a mat, which strongly suggests a mat is required. The frequent referencing of 'stretch' in tags also supports the likelihood of mat use to provide comfort and support during floor exercises. Therefore, the confidence in requiring a mat is very high at 0.9. No other equipment is implied or mentioned in the metadata, indicating that a mat is likely the only necessary equipment for this workout."
