I made this stretching routine with no equipment or gym needed! This full body stretch is for beginners and athletes as well. You can use this as a stretching warmup for other training, or as a daily routine to keep your body healthy. These stretching exercises also focus on strengthening certain ranges of motion. The muscles stretched in this routine are the calves, hamstrings, quads, hip flexors, lats, traps, chest, shoulders, and neck. These stretching exercises for men & women can also be done after a workout for a cool down.

Just do it and try.<br>I came from a home-office body and was folded like a piece of paper from 60+ hours at my Laptop a week<br><br>After trying almost everything in the internet to make my backpain go away, this is the only solution I found that actually works. Don&#39;t miss the second video that belongs to this practise.<br><br>Ahh.. not to forget: I have Scoliosis with 3 areas having partly 31\u00b0 screw up. <br><br>But the BEST about this video:  The voice, the softly spoken words. Its such a lovely contrast to Xmen like Bodybuilders here at youtube. I almost thought you americans only communicate with yelling.<br><br>Much love to anyone and specially to Josh!",
