  "vibesExplanation": "The metadata of the workout video strongly indicates a vibe of 'The Reboot Workout' with a perfect score of 1.0. This workout is described as a full body stretching routine suitable for active recovery or cooling down after a workout, signaling a focus on deep stretch and low stress which aligns with the 'Reboot Workout' vibe. Key phrases such as 'release low back pain,' 'tight hips,' and 'tense muscles' suggest a restorative purpose. The second vibe, 'The Zen Flow,' scores 0.8 because the workout emphasizes breath control and intentional movement. The description and timestamps indicate activities like lizard pose, child's pose, and encouraging breathwork, which are central to 'Zen Flow'. Lastly, there's a mild indication of 'The Foundation Builder' vibe with a score of 0.4, due to its focus on 'mobility' and relieving tension, which hints at strengthening and perfecting basics. The use of no equipment and grounding exercises further support relaxation and restoration, but not necessarily skill-building, hence it's not the dominant vibe."
