  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is strongly classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' because it is a High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) workout, as indicated by both the title ('20 Minute FULL BODY HIIT Workout') and description detailing short bursts of 40 seconds of work followed by 20 seconds of rest. The exercise list includes explosive movements like burpees and lunge jumps, characterized by high intensity.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' is assigned a score of 0.95 due to the fast-paced, dynamic nature of the exercises and the explicit 'HIIT' tag in both the title and tags.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' receives a score of 0.75 because the workout follows a clear sequence of 20 different exercises, each with timed intervals, showcasing a methodical approach to training.\n\n'Sport & Agility' scores 0.6 as several exercises, such as lateral run with jump and bear crawls, are designed to improve coordination and mimics athletic movements. However, this spirit is secondary given the primary focus on intensity.\n\nOther spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm', 'Soothing & Restorative', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were not chosen due to the lack of focus on continuous movement patterns, relaxation, or an outdoor setting."
