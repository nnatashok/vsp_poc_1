  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the nature of Pilates and the metadata's emphasis on continuous movement.

The scoring for Flow is set at 0.7 due to the description indicating the session's fluidity and express pace.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' also captures the calming yet challenging nature of the workout as noted in user comments. The comments suggest that while the session is challenging, it is also calming, indicating a balance of effort and flow.\n\nIt's also associated with 'Structured & Disciplined' due to Pilates' inherent focus on form and precision, supported by the channel's reliance on professional training methods.

The intensity noted in the comments leans toward challenge over relaxation, excluding it from a primary classification but acknowledging its presence."
