  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is described as an \"at home pilates core workout\" focused on deep core activation for abs. There are no explicit mentions of equipment in the title, description, tags, or top comments, suggesting it is a bodyweight workout. Pilates workouts commonly use mats, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the metadata. Given that this video is an \"at home\" routine and emphasizes core exercises, it likely does not require any external equipment. This supports the conclusion that the workout can be completed with bodyweight exercises alone."
