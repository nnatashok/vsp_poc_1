  "description": "Hello everyone! \n\n25 minute Stretch and Strength Routine\n\nI thought I\u2019d share today my simple stretch and strength routine I like to do on my mat. \n\nIt focuses on the hamstrings, hips, core, back and shoulders. \n\nSimply find a quiet place, position your mat and enjoy a relaxing stretch combined with some gentle holds and dynamic moves.\n\nI hope you enjoy this and maybe think about incorporating more stretching into your weekly routine. \n\nCx\n\nSubscribe to my YouTube Fitness Channel here: https://youtube.com/c/carolinegirvan/?sub_confirmation=1",
