  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is best classified under 'Flow & Rhythm', 'Soothing & Restorative', and 'Structured & Disciplined'. The title explicitly mentions 'Pilates', which is inherently a mind-body practice characterized by smooth transitions and coordinated movements, indicative of 'Flow & Rhythm'. The channel's focus on Pilates and the professional dance background of the instructor further emphasize this spirit, scoring a high confidence of 0.8. The comments highlight the elegance and style of the movements, and the enjoyment of challenging positions, aligning with rhythmic and flowing qualities. \n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is relevant due to the emphasis on calmness and mindful movement, as seen in both the description and comments expressing the practice as healing and centered around mindful breathing. This scores a 0.6 since relaxation and stress reduction are mentioned but not the primary focus. \n\nLastly, 'Structured & Disciplined' is applicable because Pilates is a systematic form of exercise requiring technical precision. Terms like 'intermediate', 'full body', and 'new movements' from the tags and comments suggest a structured routine with progressive difficulty, warranting a confidence score of 0.4. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' do not fit due to the moderate intensity and focus on elegance and control, not maximal physical exertion."
