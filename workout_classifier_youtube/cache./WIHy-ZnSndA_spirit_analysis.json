  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Structured & Disciplined' with high confidence due to several indicators. The title explicitly mentions a 'beginner workout routine', suggesting an organized and methodical approach suitable for novices. The multiple mentions of 'strength training for beginners' in both the title and tags reinforce this approach, aiming to progressively build strength in a controlled manner. \n\nThe spirit of 'Soothing & Restorative' receives a moderate confidence score due to comments describing the workout as manageable and beneficial for individuals recovering from health issues like chemotherapy. This suggests a gentle introduction that emphasizes recovery and gradual improvement, typical of restorative workouts.\n\nAlternative spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' are excluded as there's no evidence of high intensity or fast-paced elements in the metadata, nor is there a musical or rhythm-focused aspect to suggest 'Flow & Rhythm'."
