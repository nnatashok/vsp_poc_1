  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Flow & Rhythm' with a high score of 0.95 due to the emphasis on a 'yoga flow' which inherently involves continuous, smooth transitions between poses, as indicated by tags and the title '20 Minute Everyday Vinyasa Yoga Flow.' The presence of terms like 'flow' and 'vinyasa' support this classification, as they imply a synchronized movement pattern often aligned with music or breath.\n\n'Soothing & Restorative' is also a significant aspect with a score of 0.85. The description highlights the routine as a 'quick pick me up,' suggesting it provides a gentle rejuvenation rather than intense exertion. Comments further describe the session as 'slow,' 'peaceful,' and 'calm,' indicating a focus on relaxation and stress reduction, which are key elements of the soothing spirit.\n\nOther potential spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the gentle, mindful nature indicated by both the content description and user comments praising the calm approach."
