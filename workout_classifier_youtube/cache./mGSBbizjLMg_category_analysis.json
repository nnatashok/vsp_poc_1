  "categoriesExplanation": "The video metadata indicates a strong presence of weight workouts and HIIT exercises. The title 'Upper Body Tabata Workout -- Intense 60 Minute Back, Shoulders, and Arms Workout' explicitly mentions 'Tabata' and 'intense,' suggesting a HIIT structure (score: 0.7). However, the presence of 'dumbbell workouts' and focus on 'upper body toning' in both the tags and description emphasize the use of weights, making 'Weight workout' the primary category (score: 0.8). The channel, FitnessBlender, is known for a mixture of workout styles including HIIT and strength training, further supporting this classification. The user comments reinforce the intensity and effectiveness of the upper body strength focus, aligning with the weight training intent. Therefore, HIIT is involved due to the Tabata style, but the primary emphasis appears to be weight-focused strength training for upper body muscles."
