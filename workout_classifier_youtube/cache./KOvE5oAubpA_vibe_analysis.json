  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video '10 Minute Full Body Stretch & Mobility [DAILY ROUTINE]' by Juice & Toya embodies 'The Reboot Workout' vibe primarily because it aims to reduce pain, tension, or soreness, characteristic of a total-body refresh. The description highlights the session as suitable for a warm-up or cool down, aligning with the low stress and gentle movement indicative of reboot workouts. This vibe receives a high score of 0.8 due to specific mentions of terms like 'recovery stretch routine' and 'cool down stretch'.\n\nIn addition, 'The Zen Flow' vibe is present due to the intentional and breath-centered approach typical of stretching and mobility workouts aimed at reducing tension, described as reducing pain and soreness. However, classical elements like unhurried movement programming and the breathing focus aren't as explicitly emphasized as other Zen Flow programs, thus it receives a score of 0.6. \n\nThe comments further reinforce the calming and restorative nature of the session, used as a wake-up routine and recovery tool, aligning with both selected vibes. Other potential vibes, like 'The Deep Recharge', were considered but excluded due to the workout's active engagement rather than passive stretching."
