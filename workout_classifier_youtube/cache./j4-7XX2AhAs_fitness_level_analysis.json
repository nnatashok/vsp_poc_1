  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for this yoga video is predominantly at the Beginner level, as suggested by the emphasis on gentle movement and regulation of the nervous system, which aligns with simple yoga practices. The description and tags such as 'parasympathetic nervous system' and 'rest and digest practice' indicate a calming, low-complexity session. The reference to guiding the body through awareness of breath suggests basic yoga movements, suitable for beginners. However, there is a minor presence of Intermediate aspects given the potential inclusion of moderately complex poses for grounding purposes, hence a secondary score for Intermediate.",

This is confirmed by the welcoming channel tone for all levels and the gentle practice depicted. Additionally, Intermediate fitness levels are also a possibility, albeit at a lower score, due to the inclusion of some grounding techniques that might demand a bit more attention to breathe and balance, especially for users new to yoga."
