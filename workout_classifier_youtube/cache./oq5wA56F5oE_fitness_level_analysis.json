  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout primarily involves using an elliptical machine, which requires minimal technique complexity. The primary actions are repetitive, involving movements similar to walking or running, which are straightforward. The metadata and description emphasize the ease of maintaining form on an elliptical, suggesting that it does not demand high coordination or technical skills. The title also explicitly mentions that it's a 'Beginner' workout.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as being in the 'Fat-Burning Zone,' which is a moderate intensity level (60-70% of maximum heart rate). This suggests more than just a light effort but less demanding than high-intensity exercise. The duration is 15 minutes, which typically aligns with low to moderate effort levels. Since it\u2019s securely in the lower cardio intensity, this aligns with both light and moderate levels, as it is easy enough for beginners, yet provides sufficient challenge for slightly more experienced users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the technique difficulty being 'Beginner' and the effort difficulty ranging from 'Light' to 'Moderate,' this workout is most suitable for beginners. The explicit mention in the title and the general simplicity of using an elliptical machine support this. However, intermediate users could also find benefit, particularly if they are looking to include lower-intensity workouts into their regimen. The description highlights the purpose of fat-burning and introductory intensity, indicating it is accessible to people new to exercise, but also advantageous for more regular exercisers focusing on fat loss and cardiovascular health."
