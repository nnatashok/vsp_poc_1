  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is a workout involving a stationary bike, as indicated by the title 'Stationary Bike Workout' and extensive use of tags like 'indoor cycling,' 'spin bike,' and 'exercise bike workout.' This strongly supports the primary category of 'Indoor biking' with a very high confidence score of 0.9. The description mentions 'Tabata protocol,' a well-known form of high-intensity interval training, which justifies the secondary category of 'HIIT' with a high confidence score of 0.7. The mention of alternating periods of intense exercise with rest periods directly aligns with HIIT methodology. Tags and channel information further reinforce that the video content focuses on indoor cycling, frequently mentioning VR integration, but this does not affect the core exercise type classification. Overall, the metadata provides clear and explicit indicators of both categories with a very high level of confidence."
