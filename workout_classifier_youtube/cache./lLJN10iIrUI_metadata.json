    "We really need you on our UK morning shows to get us going. You are a tonic to the soul. You remind me of my fun times with my late mom.",
    "If you feel tempted to skip your exercise on a certain day, along comes these 5min HITT workouts, and then you say... &quot; I can manage this one!&quot;  I really appreciate these short but active sessions! Thanks again to both you lovely ladies!! :-)",
    "Love the jumping jacks. I thought those days were long gone. 5 minutes makes it easy to not avoid doing all of them. 30 second count downs I love. As short spurts and not &quot;when will this end?&quot; Looks like many of us can benefit from 5 minute work outs. Plus during the day, just do some spread out during some downside.",
    "Love this! I am obese, 61, and haven&#39;t moved much in over 2 years. I could do this while sitting and am proud to have finished it. My heart rate went up. I can see me doing this at least twice a day and build up to the other exercise videos. My shoulders have been hurting lately and this will get them moving. Thank you so much. You just may have saved my life! \u2665",
    "I have not been on top of my workouts lately, but this video has helped me to kick start my daily exercise routines and get back in the game!!\u2764\u2764\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc"
