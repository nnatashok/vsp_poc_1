  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title '60 Minute Full Body Dumbbell Strength Workout [With Audio Cues]' explicitly mentions 'dumbbell,' indicating the necessity of dumbbells for the workout. This is further reinforced in the description, which states, 'All you need is a pair of dumbbells to complete this session,' clearly designating dumbbells as essential equipment. The tags also include phrases like 'full body dumbbell workout,' 'dumbbell strength,' and '1 hour dumbbell workout,' all emphasizing the use of dumbbells. The confidence level is very high (1.0) because there is consistent and explicit evidence across the title, description, and tags that dumbbells are central to the workout."
