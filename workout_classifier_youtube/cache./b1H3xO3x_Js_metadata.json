    "Omg I almost did it you guys. I started in January and am obese and struggle a lot, a lot of modifications. I almost managed this one without dropping the knee during those 3 legged dogs. Soooo close. I can feel myself getting stronger!",
    "I just spent the best 20 minutes of my life. I have been doing YWA every day since last July. I am 76 and loving my progress. Thank you A. I wake up and say to myself Yes YWA!",
    "Adriene, I just wanted to say thanks so much for never putting ads in the middle for people like me who don\u2019t have YouTube premium. It keeps the quality of your videos high and doesn\u2019t break the focus of all of us who are practicing. \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97",
    "I love that whenever Adriene says to whisper \u201cI am strong\u201d, she does it too. Makes me feel like we\u2019re in it together and she\u2019s not \u201cabove\u201d us or anything! &lt;3"
