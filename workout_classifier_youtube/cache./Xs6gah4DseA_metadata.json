It\u2019s so good to have these wonderful gentle sessions on your channel, perfect for getting a tired and battered body back to moving again. Wouldn\u2019t mind a few more of these... Thank you!",

I found this video and after along time of not wanting to do things I feel so much better. Thank-you.",
