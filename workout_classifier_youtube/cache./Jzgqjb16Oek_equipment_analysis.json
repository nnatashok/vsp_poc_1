  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata of the video suggests that the workout is a HIIT cardio exercise designed to be performed either at home with no equipment or at the gym with various equipment options. The description explicitly states that the workout \"doesn't matter if you have access to equipment or not,\" and is \"suitable for use at home with no equipment or at the gym.\" Although it mentions potential equipment like an exercise bike, rowing machine, or treadmill for gym settings, these are optional and not required to complete the workout at home. The tags such as \"HIIT workout no equipment\" and \"bodyweight workout\" reinforce the focus on bodyweight exercises. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only and does not require any specific equipment."
