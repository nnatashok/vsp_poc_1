  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workouts focus on full body stretching, implying basic movements targeted at increasing flexibility and mobility. With stretches for neck, hamstrings, thighs, and other muscles, the technique difficulty does not exceed basic coordination and ranges of motion. It is suitable for beginners due to its simplicity; however, some intermediate inclusion is justified since proper stretching technique requires some awareness, especially with notes on needing a warm-up.",
