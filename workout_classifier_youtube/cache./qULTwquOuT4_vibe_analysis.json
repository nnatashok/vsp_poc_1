  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'BEGINNER FLEXIBILITY ROUTINE (Stretches for the Inflexible)' strongly indicates a vibe of 'The Reboot Workout' with a score of 0.9. This classification is based on the emphasis on stretching, low stress, and total-body refreshment, as stated in the description and tags such as 'beginner flexibility', 'stretches for the inflexible', and '30 min stretch routine'. The routine is aimed at increasing flexibility, suggesting a gentle and restorative approach.\n\n'Zen Flow' is also a strong match with a score of 0.8 due to the nature of the workout focusing on intentional, breath-centered, and unhurried stretching, as evidenced by the comments describing the process of gradually increasing flexibility and the phrase 'really allow yourself to sit into this pose'.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Foundation Builder' is moderately represented with a score of 0.6 as the workout helps beginners improve their flexibility, strengthen weak points, and perfect basic postures over time, as supported by the comments indicating gradual progress and commitment to flexibility improvements.\n\nExcluded higher intensity vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Groove Session' due to the non-intense, non-rhythm-focused nature of the workout. The confidence level is high because the title, description, comments, and tags all consistently align with these vibes."
