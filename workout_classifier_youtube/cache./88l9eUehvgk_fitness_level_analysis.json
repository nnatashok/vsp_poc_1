  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated primarily as 'Beginner' due to the straightforward nature of walk-run intervals on a treadmill, which requires minimal coordination or balance beyond that of regular walking and running. The metadata's emphasis on this being suitable for beginners and the simplicity of treadmill use support a 'Beginner' rating. An 'Intermediate' level is also assigned due to potential unfamiliarity with treadmill workouts for some users, as well as minor coordination in transitioning from walking to running.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as 'Moderate' given the workout's 15-minute duration and intervals of walking and running. This aligns with the description suggesting it is effective yet quick, and the flexibility to adjust speeds and inclines based on comfort. The presence of intervals introduces a slightly amplified output, edging toward 'Challenging' for less conditioned users, especially at more intense settings. Multiple user comments indicate varying intensity management, reinforcing the inclusion of both levels.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is set to 'Beginner' and 'Intermediate' due to the walking and running intervals that cater to all levels, as highlighted in the description. Although this is a low commitment duration, the variability in user experiences (as seen in comments) and ability to self-modify intensity supports an additional 'Intermediate' level rating. This is consistent with the advice to adjust speeds and inclines according to personal comfort, acknowledging the need for some fitness baseline for running intervals."
