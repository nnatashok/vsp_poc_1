  "vibesExplanation": "The workout primarily aligns with \"The Comfort Moves\" vibe. The title and description emphasize the video as \"easy\" and \"gentle,\" aimed at stroke patients, matching the vibe's focus on safe and feel-good movements. The exercises are performed from a chair, further supporting this classification. This vibe is scored at 0.9 due to the strong emphasis on comfort and ease.\n\nAdditionally, elements of \"The Foundation Builder\" vibe are present. The exercises aim to strengthen specific muscle groups (glutes, hips, and ankles), helping rebuild basic mobility and strength in stroke recovery patients, which aligns with perfecting the basics and addressing weak points. This is reflected in the description's emphasis on improving overall mobility and independence. This vibe is scored at 0.75 due to its secondary presence but clear relevance to the workout's intent.\n\nOther vibes, like \"The Reboot Workout,\" were considered, but the emphasis on strength-building over purely stretching or refreshment reduced their relevance here."
