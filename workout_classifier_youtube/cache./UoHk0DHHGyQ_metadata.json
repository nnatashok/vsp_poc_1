  "description": "\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc Last few days to register for our 21-Day Yoga Program: https://yoga.satvicmovement.org/?utm_source=sy_yt&utm_medium=video_desc&utm_campaign=morningenergyyoga\n \u2728 \nTo practice many asanas, meditations and learn the yoga philosophy.\n\nThis beautiful morning yoga flow is the perfect substitute for your coffee or tea.

Start your mornings right with our Yoga for High Morning Energy routine and get ready to embrace the day with vitality and enthusiasm!\n\nThings to remember \n1. Practice on an empty stomach. Always keep a gap of at least 3 hours between your meal and practice. If you have had a fruit, 2 hours is good enough.\n2. Wear loose cotton clothes while practising. Please do NOT wear tight, polyester, dry fit clothing while practising yoga. Your skin needs fresh air as you get in and out of asanas. \n3. Practice only as much as you comfortably can. Never try to force yourself into poses. Please remember to be gentle with yourself.\n4. If you\u2019re a complete beginner, it would be wise to keep a mirror next to you. This will help you observe yourself as you get in and out of asanas and allow to self-correct\n\nStay consistent with your practice with this yoga camp.
