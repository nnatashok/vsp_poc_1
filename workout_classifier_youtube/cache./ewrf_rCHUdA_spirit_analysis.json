  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified mainly as 'High-Energy & Intense' due to explicit mentions in the title and description, such as 'HIIT', 'Cardio', 'Max!', and phrases like 'seriously tough workout'. These indicate a vigorous, heart-pumping session typical of high-intensity interval training. Comments from viewers reinforce this spirit, describing the workout as physically demanding with phrases such as \"killed me\" and \"legs were dead\". This indicates an extremely strong match, reflected in the score of 0.95.\n\nThe spirit of 'Structured & Disciplined' also applies due to the methodical interval format described ('2 Min over threshold', '30s Max!', etc.), suggesting a regimented workout plan involving precise duration and intensity fluctuations. This planned sequence is typical of disciplined training programs, garnering a score of 0.75 for noticeable elements of structured training. Other spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative', 'Flow & Rhythm', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were considered irrelevant due to lack of applicable attributes in the metadata."
