  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout, titled \"22 Minute Full Body Gentle Yoga Practice for Beginners and Athletes,\" clearly emphasizes a gentle and healing approach, which aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. It is designed for beginners and athletes on easy days to recover, stretch, and strengthen, which further underscores its restorative nature. The description supports this by suggesting it's ideal for recovery and relaxation, and user comments highlight its benefits in terms of pain relief and relaxation. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong correlation with soothing qualities. \n\nAdditionally, the use of phrases such as \"vinyasa yoga\" and \"functional flow\" in the tags and description indicates elements of 'Flow & Rhythm'. Vinyasa and flow suggest smooth, continuous movement patterns often synchronized with breath and music, as noted in their use of Epidemic Sound for music. The score of 0.7 reflects a significant but secondary presence of fluid movement characteristic of this spirit. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the gentle and restorative focus of the practice."
