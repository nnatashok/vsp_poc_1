  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Indoor biking' with a score of 1, due to the explicit mention in the title '10 Min HIIT Cycle Bike Workout' and multiple references throughout the description and tags such as 'cycle bike HIIT,' 'indoor cycling for beginners,' and 'spin class.' The emphasis on cycling activities strongly supports this classification. Additionally, the category 'HIIT' is also applied with a score of 0.8. The title and description explicitly mention 'HIIT cycle,' indicating a structure involving high-intensity intervals, further confirmed by the workout plan provided: '12x 30 sec on (high resistance, all out cadence); 15 sec off (easy recovery).' These details align with the principles of HIIT. The combination of cycling and high-intensity intervals is well supported by the metadata, leading to high confidence in these classifications. Other potential categories were considered irrelevant given the specificity of the indoor cycling HIIT focus."
