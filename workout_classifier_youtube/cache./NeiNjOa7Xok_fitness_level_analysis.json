  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists primarily of static stretches and basic pilates-inspired movements such as 'Standing Side Stretch', 'Child\u2019s Pose', and 'Cobra'. These exercises generally require minimal coordination and are suitable for those with limited fitness experience. The inclusion of more Pilates-based moves like 'Table Top Side Opener' provides a slightly increased complexity, suggesting a rudimentary exposure to Pilates exercises could be beneficial. However, overall, these routines are accessible for most beginners.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is primarily a stretching routine with a focus on flexibility rather than cardiovascular or muscular endurance. Given the gentle nature and pace of the exercises\u2014common in routines designed to improve flexibility\u2014energy expenditure remains low. Although the workout duration is over 20 minutes, which might suggest moderate difficulty, the lack of high intensity or sustained effort keeps this primarily in the 'Light' category.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The combination of 'Beginner' technique difficulty and primarily 'Light' effort difficulty indicates that this workout is especially suitable for beginners, including those who might be starting a fitness routine or returning after a long break. The nature of stretching and flexibility exercises also makes it accessible to 'Intermediate' users seeking gentle activity. The metadata and comments suggest ease of access and suitability for those with chronic conditions, further reinforcing broad accessibility."
