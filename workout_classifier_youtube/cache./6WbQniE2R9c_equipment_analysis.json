  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The only equipment explicitly mentioned in the video description is an 'exercise mat or other soft surface'. This indicates that a Mat is required for this stretching routine, as stretching exercises commonly involve lying or sitting on the floor. The emphasis is on relaxation and flexibility, which typically involves being positioned comfortably. The high confidence score of 0.95 is due to the clear mention of a mat and its typical use in stretching workouts. Other equipment options are not mentioned or implied in any other part of the metadata."
