  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is a quiet cardio session with no jumping, designed for fat loss and described as apartment friendly. The tags 'quiet cardio', 'no jumping workout', and 'full body workout' indicate moderate intensity that can build energy over time, consistent with 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe due to its focus on steady, feel-good movement. The title emphasizes 'Fat Loss' and 'No Jumping', suggesting a preference for lower intensity, sustainable workout sessions, aligning with 'The Endorphin Wave'. The 'Disciplined Grind' vibe is suggested by the metadata's emphasis on consistency and fat loss ('burn belly fat', 'weight loss'), and the structured nature of workouts typical in Emi Wong's channel, as reflected in user comments about workout challenges and routine adherence. High confidence in 'The Endorphin Wave' is justified by explicit tags and content description, and moderate confidence in 'The Disciplined Grind' due to implicit seeking of sustainable fitness lifestyle."
