  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is likely at a Beginner level as it is described as a 'bed time workout' and is designed to be done before sleeping. The mention of bodyweight exercises and no equipment suggests straightforward movements with minimal coordination required. However, comments indicating a plank exercise and some level of challenge suggest a mild alignment with Intermediate levels, but overall complexity seems low.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "At 12 minutes in duration, and as an evening workout described as conducive to sleep, the effort level is likely Light. User comments mention noticeable physical improvements, indicative of engagement but not extreme exertion. However, terms like 'burn fat' and 'cardio and resistance training' slightly elevate it to some low-level Moderate effort, albeit not consistently challenging due to brief duration and rest indication.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the Beginner technique and Light effort involved, a Beginner fitness level is most appropriate, as these exercises are meant for easy, at-home execution. The mentions of progress in user comments and slight challenges in the workout suggest Intermediate level fitness could also benefit, providing they adjust intensity based on their capabilities."
