  "vibesExplanation": "The video is primarily characterized by a 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, scoring an 0.8, due to its focus on providing a 'guided stretching routine,' highlighting a focus on deep stretch, low stress, and a total-body refresh. This is supported by the description mentioning holding static stretches to target common tight areas. The 'Foundation Builder' vibe also fits, scoring a 0.7, owing to the emphasis on strengthening weak points and improving flexibility in areas prone to tightness among runners, making it foundational. The presence of 'The Comfort Moves' vibe is less pronounced (score 0.5) but relevant, as the routine is described as suitable post-run and described as relaxing by a top comment, underscoring its safe, low-intensity nature. Other vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Groove Session' were considered but not selected due to lack of emphasis on breath-centered or expressive movement."
