  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '10 Minute Guided Meditation for Positive Energy, Peace & Light \ud83c\udf24' is focused on a meditation practice rather than a physical workout requiring equipment. The description and tags emphasize guided meditation, visualization, relaxation, and affirmations, which are typically conducted in a sitting or lying position without specialized equipment. Meditation sessions often happen on a comfortable surface like a mat, but the metadata does not explicitly mention a mat or any other equipment, and no equipment is suggested or discussed in the comments or description. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that this meditation video is intended for bodyweight participation without the need for additional equipment. Hence, the list of required equipment is empty as the workout appears to be bodyweight only."
