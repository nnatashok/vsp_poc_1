  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a 20-minute lower body stretch routine that emphasizes recovery and flexibility, focusing on areas like the hamstrings, butt, and hips. Given that the stretches primarily target floor work, a mat is likely essential to perform these exercises comfortably. This is further supported by the description, which mentions \"THE MAT I USE\" with a link to purchase a mat, indicating its central role in the workout. The tags also include terms like \"yoga\" and \"stretching exercises,\" which are commonly associated with mat use. Therefore, a mat is highly recommended for this workout, and its mention in the description warrants a high confidence score of 0.9."
