  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a 15-minute duration focused on flexibility and relaxation, the video is designed to be low intensity. The emphasis on relaxation and inclusion in daily routines suggests minimal energy expenditure. The absence of high-intensity indicators like rapid movements or limited rest further supports a light effort difficulty. The video serves more as a gentle routine to maintain flexibility rather than a physically demanding workout.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the light effort and beginner to advanced exercise options, this workout can accommodate a range of fitness levels. The description's direct mention of suits all levels backs this assessment. It's accessible for complete beginners but provides enough variability for those with more experience to feel engaged, aligning with comments from both less flexible and more experienced users. Advanced-level appeal comes from potentially incorporating deeper or more challenging stretches. The stretch-focused nature requires no prior athletic training, making it appropriate across multiple fitness levels."
