  "channelDescription": "Quick + effective home workouts that get results! Like stronger than you've ever been kind of results. \n\nI'm Lindsey Bomgren, Certified Personal Trainer + Pre-and-Postnatal Fitness Instructor, and mom of 3 littles. \n\nAs a busy mom, I\u2019m all about quick and effective home workouts! I truly feel that doing the physically hard stuff makes you more capable of handling all the mentally challenging things that come at you daily. I don\u2019t film workout videos to give you six pack abs or a nice butt. I film workout videos because I know fitness makes me a better wife, mother, friend and human and I want to share that with you. \n\nI pray you find the workout inspiration + motivation you were seeking when you stumbled over here. Give me 10-30 minutes of your time today and I bet you\u2019ll come back for more tomorrow!\n\nPray often. Move your body. Eat your veggies. Love others + yourself.\n",

    "The 4 repeat cycles at the end were sooooo tough- my heart rate was through the roof &amp; thought I might pass out (but knew I wouldn&#39;t)! Feel AMAZING afterward though. I wouldn&#39;t challenge myself without you ladies- thank you!!!!",
    "LOVE this workout. Thank you Lindsey and Rachel!",
    "This was one of those workouts that as I&#39;m doing it my daughter will come in and ask how mean Lindsey is being today &amp; I say REALLY mean! LOL! Loved this one! Thanks ladies!",
    "Dumbbell Squat Set Down + Plank Walk Out + 2 Knee Drives was prob my favorite, but great workout and that AMRAP sent my heartrate soaring! You asked about our why... I started working at a hospital and now see many people every day laying in a hospital bed, unable to do anything... we never know what life will throw our way... I feel blessed to be able to do these workouts. Thanks for all you do, ladies! 248",
