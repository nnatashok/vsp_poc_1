  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category of 'Meditation' is selected with a score of 1.0 due to the metadata's strong emphasis on meditative properties. The title explicitly mentions 'Meditation & Sleep', and the description discusses frequencies that facilitate deep meditation and inner peace, focusing on a sense of calm and mental reset. Moreover, the channel's focus, described as providing music for meditation and healing, further supports this categorization. Comments also support the video's use for meditation, as users describe using the video to meditate and ease their minds in times of stress.\nThe category of 'Breathing exercises' is chosen with a score of 0.5 because of the focus on inducing relaxation and mind-body connection through frequency music, which often accompanies conscious breathing practices. However, no explicit mention of breathing exercises is in the metadata; hence, a lower score reflects this inference. Other potential categories like 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were excluded due to the lack of physical movement or postures depicted in the metadata."
