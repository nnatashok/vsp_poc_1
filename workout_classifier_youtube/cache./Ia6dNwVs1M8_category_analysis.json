  "categoriesExplanation": "The selected categories are based on a thorough analysis of the metadata provided. The primary category assigned is 'Body weight' with a score of 0.8, because the workout is described as a general pregnancy exercise routine, which typically involves body weight exercises that are safe during pregnancy. The description and tags mention exercises designed to increase energy and relieve nausea, common with light body weight routines. \n\nYoga is given a score of 0.6. The channel's description indicates a strong emphasis on yoga for pregnancy, and the associated yoga playlists suggest this is a typical part of the content, even though the specific video doesn't explicitly label itself as yoga.\n\nStretching is included with a score of 0.4 due to its common inclusion in prenatal exercise routines for flexibility and comfort, though it's less emphasized in the video description and title. \nComments praise the workout's ability to calm and strengthen participants, aligning with both body weight and yoga exercises. No direct references to HIIT, weight training, or specific cardio modalities were found, ruling those out."
