  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"20-Minute Interval Run Workout\" includes the tag \"treadmill workout\" and \"indoor running workouts,\" which strongly implies that a treadmill is a suitable piece of equipment for performing the workout, especially in indoor settings. The interval running format described in the description suggests that using a treadmill would facilitate the precise control of speed and rest intervals. While the workout could technically be completed outdoors without any equipment, the inclusion of tags related to treadmill use justifies a high confidence score of 0.7 for including a treadmill as needed equipment."
