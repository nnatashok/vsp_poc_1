  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is assessed primarily as 'Beginner' since the video involves guided breathwork, which is typically simple and doesn't require advanced coordination. The description and tags mention that it is suitable for beginners. Key phrases such as 'ideal for beginners and experienced practitioners' and the focus on basic breathing techniques like dirga pranayama support this assessment. However, as breathing exercises can have variations in technique that may slightly increase complexity for those unfamiliar, a mild level of 'Intermediate' difficulty is possible, hence the score of 0.5 for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as 'Light' because the workout involves breathwork, which generally requires minimal physical exertion and is often used for stress relief and relaxation. The metadata describes the session as 'calming' and 'beneficial for asthmatics,' indicating low physical demand. The duration of just under 16 minutes aligns with a low-effort rating when considering breathwork, known to be less physically taxing than other forms of exercise.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level for this workout is predominantly 'Beginner', given the simplicity of the exercises and the meditation techniques described in the metadata. However, there is a small overlap with 'Intermediate' due to the mention of variations in technique and potential slight complexity in coordinating breathing patterns. The multiple mentions of being suitable for beginners corroborate a strong alignment with the beginner level. The channel's focus on beginner-friendly and accessible techniques suggests that even those with little fitness experience can participate effectively."
