  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is 'Pilates' with a high score of 1.0 due to the strong indicators in the metadata. The video title explicitly mentions 'Pilates,' and the author is a certified Pilates instructor specializing in mat exercises, as noted in the channel description. Furthermore, top comments from users explicitly mention using pilates regularly, which aligns with the video's content. The high view and like count further reinforce its relevance and popularity for Pilates enthusiasts.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Body weight' with a moderate score of 0.5. The title specifies 'no equipment,' indicating that exercises in the video rely on body weight for resistance, a common feature in Pilates routines. Though the focus remains on Pilates, the presence of body weight exercises is somewhat evident and justifies its inclusion. The workout does not fit categories like 'Mat' alone since it aligns closely with Pilates principles rather than generic mat exercises, warranting its lower score in 'Body weight.'"
