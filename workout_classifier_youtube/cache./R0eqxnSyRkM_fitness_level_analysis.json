  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty primarily aligns with the 'Beginner' level due to the focus on dynamic stretching and core exercises, which are typically straightforward movements without complex coordination requirements. User comments also reflect that the motions are easy to follow, suitable for users with injuries, indicating an accessible technique level. The 'Intermediate' score is included due to the presence of exercises like the 'boat pose', which may require a moderate degree of core strength and body awareness.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty skews towards 'Light', as the workout is designed as a recovery session with dynamic stretching and core strengthening, reflecting a low energy expenditure. The workout structure includes short 50-second work intervals with 10-second rest periods, consistent with light to moderate intensity. The video is tagged as suitable for 'Beginner to Medium' levels, supporting a moderate but not challenging intensity rating.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner', as stated explicitly in the description ('Beginner to Medium') and reflected in user comments noting suitability for those with injuries and first-time exercisers. 'Intermediate' is included due to the duration over 20 minutes and exercises like the boat pose, which require some degree of core strength. Although labeled a recovery workout, the inclusion of some core work slightly raises the minimum fitness level to include intermediates who would engage more comfortably."
