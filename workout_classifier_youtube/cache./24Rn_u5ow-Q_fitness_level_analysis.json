  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video focuses on guided meditation, which is a simple practice requiring minimal physical or technical skill. The metadata describes the use of a soothing male voice and guided imagery, characteristic of straightforward relaxation techniques. The target audience includes people who may be new to meditation, as the Honest Guys aim to make meditation accessible to those turned off by complex practices. Comments and tags suggest a focus on \"relaxation\" and \"quick meditation,\" alluding to a Beginner level technique difficulty without complex physical movements or challenging coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.98,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Effort difficulty is determined as 'Light' due to the nature of guided meditation, which inherently involves minimal physical exertion. The video duration of 6:43 further supports this, being shorter than intense workouts. The focus on deep relaxation and tranquil visuals suggests a calming, non-demanding session. Tags like 'quick meditation' and 'relax quickly' indicate a simple, light engagement level with no mention of strenuous or physically demanding activities.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Based on the beginner technique difficulty and light effort level, the required fitness level primarily targets Beginners, as the guided meditation only requires the ability to sit still and follow auditory cues. Intermediate users may also find value for stress relief or mindfulness enhancement, which justifies including Beginner and Intermediate levels. The emphasis on accessibility aligns strongly with the metadata and comments, confirming the approachability for novices while remaining beneficial for slightly more experienced users seeking relaxation within a short timeframe."
