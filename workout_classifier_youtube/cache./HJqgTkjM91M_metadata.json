  "description": "In recent times, Moojibaba has been offering a direct and crystal clear guided exercise for abiding in the natural state of Beingness.\n\nSeekers of truth from all backgrounds are finding this \"Just Be\" exercise highly relatable, immediate, and unexpectedly profound. When followed with earnestness and persistence, it acts as a mirror that reveals and supports the abidance in and as the non-dual Awareness.\n\n\"Have the attitude of leaving everything and keep the attention only in the natural sense that you exist and that you are here. Make a conscious choice not to engage or to be pulled into your mind stream. Just be aware of it, don't fight it, but stay empty,\u00a0consciously.\"\n\nMonte Sahaja, Portugal\n3 March 2024\n\n~\n\nMore talks like this are available on Sahaja Express:\nhttps://mooji.org/sahaja-express\n\nIf you would like to support the sharing of Satsang, you can donate here:\nhttps://mooji.org/donate?tcode=mtv7\n\n#Mooji #satsang #spirituality #advaita #nonduality #awakening",
