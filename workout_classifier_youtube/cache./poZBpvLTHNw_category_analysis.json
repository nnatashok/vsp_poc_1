  "categoriesConfidence": 0.9,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified primarily as 'Yoga' with a high confidence level of 0.9 as the title, description, and tags explicitly reference 'Yoga' multiple times, including phrases like 'Feel Good Yoga Flow', 'daily yoga', 'vinyasa yoga flow', and '20 min yoga stretch'. The channel's focus, as described, aligns with yoga and pilates, reinforcing this classification. The mention of a yoga mat and the prominence of yoga in user comments, such as appreciating the 'Feel Good Yoga Flow', strengthens the confidence in this category.\n\nAdditionally, a secondary category of 'Stretching' is considered with a score of 0.5, due to the emphasis on 'stretch and feel good' in the description and echoed in the tags like 'yoga stretch', suggesting a focus on stretching within the yoga practice. However, since the primary focus is on the broader yoga practice, the score for 'Stretching' is comparatively lower.\n\nOther categories are excluded as the content does not align with high-intensity, machine-based, weight, or meditation-oriented exercises, focusing instead on a relaxing, flow-based yoga session."
