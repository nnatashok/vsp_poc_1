  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Elliptical' with a perfect score of 1.0 due to multiple explicit references in the title, description, and tags. Words such as 'Elliptical workout,' 'Elliptical Trainer,' '20 min elliptical workout,' and repeated hashtags emphasize this focus. The channel describes the use of an elliptical machine creating a strong and undeniable link to this category.\nThe secondary category is 'HIIT' with a score of 0.8, as there are clear references to high-intensity interval training. The video is noted as a 'HIIT workout' in both the title and description, which specify the structure of 20-minute sprint training with intervals of 30 seconds of intense effort followed by 90 seconds of lower intensity. This is a classic HIIT structure and combined with mentions of 'fat loss' and 'interval training,' it suggests a significant presence of HIIT elements. The high confidence stems from the alignment of these descriptors with typical HIIT structure."
