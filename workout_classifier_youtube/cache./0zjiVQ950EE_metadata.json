  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "Thanks!",
    "I&#39;m 68.  Second bout of breast cancer during lock-down, more surgery, radiation.  I&#39;m coming back to Pilates.  There&#39;s so much I can&#39;t do yet.  But after two classes I finally feel okay again.  Thank you, Nicole.",
    "as a university student who does not have the budget to spend on Pilates classes finding your channel was an absolute game changer in my workout routine love your voice your pace and the effort you made for quality content looking forward to see more of your videos &lt;3",
    "I love it when you acknowledge how much certain exercises hurt and burn. Often instructors seem demoralizingly peppy and impervious. Love your empathy",
    "One of the rare men here, I can say that your class was amazing. If only people could understand how important these workouts are for our backs, glutes and hips! Thank you Nicole."
