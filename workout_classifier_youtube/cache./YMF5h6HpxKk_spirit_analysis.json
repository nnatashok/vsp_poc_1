  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the workout is 'Soothing & Restorative.' The video is a guided meditation aimed at promoting relaxation, stress relief, and abundance, indicated clearly by phrases such as 'sit back, relax,' 'sink into your visualizations,' and tags like 'meditation for stress and anxiety,' 'mindfulness meditation,' and 'stress relief meditation.' These point to a gentle and healing focus that is quintessential for Soothing & Restorative workouts, justifying a strong score of 0.9.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' evidenced by the mention of 'guided meditation,' the continuous nature of meditation practice, which often involves smooth, rhythmic breathing and visualization to create a mind-body connection. The description encourages listeners to 'experience the power of meditation,' which implies a fluid practice, supporting a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nWhile elements of mental discipline are present, they do not contribute to a structured physical routine, excluding 'Structured & Disciplined' as a relevant spirit. Other spirits are not applicable due to the nature of meditation as opposed to high-energy or outdoor activities."
