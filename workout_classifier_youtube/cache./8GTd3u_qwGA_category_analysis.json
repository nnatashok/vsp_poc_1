  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video primarily focuses on 'Breathing exercises' as evident from the title 'Instant Relaxation: 5-Minute Guided Breathwork for Nervous System Regulation' and tags such as 'breathing exercises' and 'breathwork'. This emphasis on breathwork for calming the nervous system aligns with the 'Breathing exercises' category, so a high score of 0.9 is assigned, reflecting its central relevance.\n\nAdditionally, the video's guidance style and purpose align closely with 'Meditation', as seen from tags like 'meditation guided' and 'breathwork meditation', and from descriptions emphasizing relaxation, mindfulness, and stress reduction. Given the integration of mindful elements in the breathing exercise, a score of 0.7 is given to 'Meditation'.\n\nOther categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were considered but excluded as the content specifically revolves around breathwork and mental relaxation rather than physical postures or flexibility."
