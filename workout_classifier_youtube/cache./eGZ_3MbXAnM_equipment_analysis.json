  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout clearly centers around a '20-Minute Treadmill Workout' as stated in the title, with explicit mention of treadmill use throughout the description. The main HIIT segment of the workout involves 'MAX EFFORT sprinting or running' and 'active rest (walking or slow jogging)', which inherently requires a treadmill. Additionally, user comments reinforce that this is a treadmill-based HIIT workout. Therefore, the treadmill is required with a very high confidence level of 1.0."
