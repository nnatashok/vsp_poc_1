  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty of this workout is primarily in the 'Beginner' range because the movements involve cycling, which is straightforward and requires minimal coordination. However, cycling does require some balance and control on equipment like a turbo trainer, so there's a mild overlap with 'Intermediate'. The tags and description suggest it's geared towards a general audience without emphasis on complex movement patterns.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'High Intensity Interval Training' session designed for fat burning and is noted to be demanding ('will hurt,' 'hard earned sweat'). The 20-minute duration with the implication of short recovery intervals suggests significant cardiovascular and muscular effort, placing it firmly in the 'Challenging' category. Comments highlight perceived high intensity and effectiveness in weight loss, reinforcing this classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the 'Challenging' effort difficulty and 'Beginner' to 'Intermediate' technique requirements, this workout best suits 'Intermediate' and above, but beginners might still participate with proper adjustments (lower resistance of cycling equipment, longer rest). The numerous user testimonies of sustainable weight loss and life improvements suggest broad accessibility but starting at an 'Intermediate' fitness level for safety and effectiveness, hence the inclusion across levels with emphasis on 'Intermediate'. The workout's cardiovascular intensity and equipment use reduce suitability for complete beginners."
