  "categoriesConfidence": 1.0,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category 'Meditation' was chosen with a high score of 1.0 due to explicit metadata elements such as the title 'Deep Relaxation in 7 Minutes (Guided Meditation)' and repeated references to meditation in the tags and description. The channel is dedicated to meditation, reinforcing this choice. The video is designed to induce relaxation and convey a meditative experience through guided imagery, which aligns perfectly with meditation practices.\n\nThe secondary category 'Breathing exercises' was given a lower score of 0.4, inferred from the comments and description suggesting deep relaxation and tension release, which often accompany breathing exercises in guided meditations. However, explicit mention of breathing techniques is lacking, and thus it holds a lower confidence as a secondary category."
