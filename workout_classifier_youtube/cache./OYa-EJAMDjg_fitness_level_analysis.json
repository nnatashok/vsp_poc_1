  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is classified as 'Beginner' with a strong score and 'Intermediate' with a moderate score. The breathwork is straightforward, involving controlled breathing patterns typical in practices like yoga and meditation. The tags, description, and comments emphasize accessibility for those new to breathwork ('beginnersyoga') but also include aspects of emotional release and meditation that may require some mindfulness and focus, which gives a minor alignment with 'Intermediate'.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.75,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Effort difficulty is 'Light' with a strong score and 'Moderate' with a moderate score. The main effort comes from the controlled breathing techniques over the 22-minute duration, which involves slow, deliberate breathing that helps with relaxation rather than intense physical exertion. Comments reflect powerful emotional experiences rather than physical exhaustion. However, a mild 'Moderate' score is assigned due to possible sensations such as tingling and light-headedness mentioned in the safety warning, which could be more demanding for some.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is scored for 'Beginner' and 'Intermediate'. Despite the video length exceeding 20 minutes, the activities involved are primarily mental and controlled breathing, making it accessible to beginners. The description and comments highlight therapeutic and calming benefits, which align with 'Beginner'. However, due to the nuanced mental focus and potential for emotional release, an 'Intermediate' score is also warranted. Overall, the activity is inclusive for different levels, with a focus on personal comfort and adaptation to one's own experience."
