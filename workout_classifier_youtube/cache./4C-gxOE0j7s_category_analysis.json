  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is 'Yoga,' with a score of 1, based on multiple strong indicators in both the title and the description. The title, '5-Minute Morning Yoga,' directly identifies the practice as yoga. The description reinforces this with phrases like 'promote healthy flow of energy' and mentions of 'Yoga Quickies' and 'short practice video.' Moreover, the tags include numerous yoga-related terms, such as 'morning yoga,' 'yoga for beginners,' and 'hatha yoga,' further confirming the presence of yoga as the central focus.\n\nThe secondary category 'Stretching' is assigned a score of 0.5 due to the nature of yoga being inherently linked with flexibility and stretching exercises. The description emphasizes promoting a 'healthy flow of energy,' which implicitly includes stretching to some extent, but this is a supportive element rather than the main focus, which warrants the score assigned.\n\nThe overall confidence in these categories is very high due to explicit mentions in title, tags, and description. Other categories like 'Pilates' or 'Meditation' were excluded because there are no direct references to pilates techniques or meditation practices in the metadata provided."
