  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is fundamentally a Pilates class, which inherently emphasizes 'Flow & Rhythm' as a core principle, focusing on smooth, continuous movements and coordination. The video title and description highlight this with terms like 'full body Pilates' and 'mat Pilates,' suggesting a flowing sequence. User comments also mention how the workout feels like 'true Pilates,' emphasizing seamless movement and attention to detail. These elements justify a high score of 0.9 for 'Flow & Rhythm.'\n\nAdditionally, 'Structured & Disciplined' is relevant due to the methodical nature of Pilates, characterized by following specific protocols and techniques, as implied in the description with 'intermediate level' and 'full-body focus.' The structured nature is further supported by the channel's focus on guided workouts, personalized training plans, and ongoing coaching, indicative of technical precision and a disciplined approach. This is validated by the user comments about detailed attention in exercises, warranting a score of 0.7 for 'Structured & Disciplined.'\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' is not applicable due to the low impact nature of Pilates described, while the absence of outdoor or sports elements excludes those spirits."
