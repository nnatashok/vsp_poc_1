    "Hey Team \u2764 I hope you enjoy this rest day routine, give back some self love to your body! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel better after it \ud83e\udd17 Anna x",
    "taking care of my body is so important to me. i never used to exercise or practice mindfulness or ate food that actually made me feel good. and now it\u2019s like a whole new perspective. i\u2019m more grateful for everything and generally more at peace with myself. it\u2019s easier to manage tasks. i\u2019m sleeping better. it\u2019s amazing.",
    "I got my periods today and this was literally all i needed! I was not in the mood to do any high intensity ones and you posted this right on time &gt;&lt; thank you soo muchh anna \ud83d\udc96",
    "When I read \u201cTake Care of Your Body, It&#39;s Your Home,\u201d I felt mixed emotions.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s sadness, a desire to cry, or a feeling of pity for what I do to myself every day.  In fact, eating disorders destroy a person&#39;s life and can even kill them.  Thank you for your work and thank you for your effort \u2764\u2764\u2764",
    "After suffering from an incomplete paralyzation with 17, I was in hospital for half a year, learning to walk again. Now it&#39;s been 3 \u00be years and right after getting out of hospital my physio started to use various Yoga stretches and exercises in our weekly appointments. Then I visited a yoga class in my gym once and been doing it since then. I was very flexible before the accident and I gained it all back, despite the metal and titan pieces holding my back and my feets together. So, I have to say thank you. Been watching your channel for a while and it helped me very much on my ongoing journey. It makes me proud to be able to follow along with most positions correctly when I once couldn&#39;t even move my legs. So please keep up the good work, it is worth it! \ud83d\ude01"
