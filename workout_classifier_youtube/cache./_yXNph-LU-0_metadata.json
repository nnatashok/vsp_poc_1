    "As someone who\u2019s just dipping there toes into calisthenics, this workout fit my level but also challenged my body in ways I was not used to. Looking forward to the gains when I incorporate this into my routine!",
    "Tom Peto, Your training videos really did a lot for me! Thx for taking the time and effort so we can live a better life! So happy I came across your trainings! Thx a lot! From Belgium!",
