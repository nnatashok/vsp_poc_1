  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video \"10 Min Yoga Full Body Stretch\" is classified into 'Yoga' and 'Stretching' categories. The title and description emphasize 'Yoga', which is further reinforced by the channel's focus on yoga videos. This indicates a high confidence that the primary method of exercise is yoga, warranting a score of 0.9. The presence of terms like 'Full Body Stretch' in both the title and tags (e.g., \"full body stretch\", \"flexibility routine\") supports the classification of 'Stretching', as it suggests exercises aimed at improving flexibility, hence a score of 0.7. Comments also highlight the aspect of stretching, such as \"Love this stretch,\" which aligns with both categories. 'Yoga' is the dominant category due to the channel's intention and content consistency, while 'Stretching' complements it by focusing on routines aimed at flexibility enhancement."
