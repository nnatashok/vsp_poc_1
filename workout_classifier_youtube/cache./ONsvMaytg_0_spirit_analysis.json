  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under 'Soothing & Restorative' with a strong score of 0.9, due to its focus on relaxation, stress reduction, and personal transformation through breathwork. The description highlights outcomes such as gaining clarity, emotional release, and relaxation, which are hallmarks of restorative practices. User comments also reflect deep emotional and psychological healing during the session, reinforcing this classification. \n\nThe secondary spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' is selected with a score of 0.7, as the breathing technique involves rhythmic breathing patterns accompanied by music, suggesting a connection to rhythmic, mind-body integration elements. The guided nature and rhythmic music production further support this. While the term 'intense' is mentioned in the context of an immersive experience, the overall tone remains soothing rather than high-intensity, thus excluding 'High-Energy & Intense'. There's no sport or nature connection, eliminating those spirits."
