  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe 'The Foundation Builder' scores highly (0.9) because the video is explicitly aimed at beginners in calisthenics, focusing on foundational exercises that build core skills and strength, as indicated by terms such as 'beginners', 'progressions', and focus on major muscle groups. The 'Progression Quest' vibe is also strong (0.85) as the video details incremental skill development, including learning complex moves like the handstand and planche, suggesting a methodical approach to long-term improvement. Additionally, the presence of specific exercises and structured routines aligns with building a disciplined fitness journey. 'The Masterclass Workout' has a moderate score (0.7) due to the focus on skill-building and technique-driven exercises, typical of calisthenics transitioning from basic to advanced moves such as muscle-ups and levers. Other vibes like 'The Disciplined Grind' were considered but excluded given the beginner-specific content and lack of high-intensity or endurance-focus that they typically entail. The confidence level is high (0.85) due to strong keywords and context."
