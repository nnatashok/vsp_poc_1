  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the simplicity of the breathing exercises (technique difficulty: Beginner) and the low physical effort required (effort difficulty: Light), this workout is well-suited for beginners. However, due to its benefits for developing a consistent practice, which some users might find requires discipline and mental motivation, some intermediate practitioners could also benefit. The technique and effort difficulties naturally suggest a beginner fitness level, but for those who struggle with mindfulness practices, a slight intermediate relevance is noted."
