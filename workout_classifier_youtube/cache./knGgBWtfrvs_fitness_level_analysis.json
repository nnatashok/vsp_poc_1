  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is predominantly Beginner, as the workout consists of basic treadmill walking and light jogging, which require minimal coordination and technical skill. There are some elements that could be challenging for a complete novice, such as increasing speeds and hills, but these are fundamentally straightforward actions for walking and jogging. Therefore, even with incremental pace changes and incline adjustments mentioned, the workout still primarily targets a Beginner audience. The inclusion of a Warm Up and Cool Down supports technique accessibility, allowing newcomers to ease into the exercise routine.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is primarily Light due to the workout's focus on walking and light jogging with recovery periods, which is suitable for beginners and has low energy expenditure. The 22-minute duration does make the workout somewhat more demanding than shorter sessions, pushing it towards Moderate for deconditioned users, especially with incremental speed and incline adjustments. The workout's structure of intervals combined with walking and light jog segments makes it supportive for beginners but can be somewhat challenging for users with low endurance if attempting to maintain higher suggested speeds.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level largely aligns with a Beginner audience, as indicated in the title and description. This workout provides options and encouragement to stay within comfort zones, making it accessible to those new to exercise or with limited experience. The Intermediate score is due to longer duration and potential challenges found in interval jogging, which might suit someone who has been exercising minimally or for a short period. The Advanced score is minor and reflects individuals looking to scale their workout through speed and incline modifications. The comments suggest options for progressive intensity, allowing users to grow in their fitness levels by revisiting the workout."
