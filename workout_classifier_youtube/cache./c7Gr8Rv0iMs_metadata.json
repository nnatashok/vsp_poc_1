  "channelDescription": "Quick + effective home workouts that get results! Like stronger than you've ever been kind of results. \n\nI'm Lindsey Bomgren, Certified Personal Trainer + Pre-and-Postnatal Fitness Instructor, and mom of 3 littles. \n\nAs a busy mom, I\u2019m all about quick and effective home workouts! I truly feel that doing the physically hard stuff makes you more capable of handling all the mentally challenging things that come at you daily. I don\u2019t film workout videos to give you six pack abs or a nice butt. I film workout videos because I know fitness makes me a better wife, mother, friend and human and I want to share that with you. \n\nI pray you find the workout inspiration + motivation you were seeking when you stumbled over here. Give me 10-30 minutes of your time today and I bet you\u2019ll come back for more tomorrow!\n\nPray often. Move your body. Eat your veggies. Love others + yourself.\n",
