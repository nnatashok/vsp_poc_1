  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for this workout video strongly indicates that it requires no equipment, as the workout is described as a 'full body calisthenics workout.' Calisthenics typically involves bodyweight exercises, which don't necessitate additional equipment. The description and tags emphasize 'at home exercises' and 'bodyweight,' further supporting this conclusion. Additionally, the exercises listed, such as inchworms, reverse lunges, wall sit, table top, arch body hold, and plank, are all bodyweight exercises that don't require specific equipment. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, suitable for practicing without any workout tools or accessories."
