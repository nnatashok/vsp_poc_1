  "categoriesExplanation": "The main category is 'Meditation' with a high confidence score of 1.0, as the title and description clearly emphasize guided meditation, with Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche instructing viewers on mindfulness and awareness techniques. The video is described as helping viewers to embrace the present moment, which is a core principle of meditation, reinforced by the tags 'meditation' and 'mindfulness.' Furthermore, the channel focuses on Tibetan Buddhist teachings, which often include meditation practices.\n\n'Breathing exercises' is assigned a lower score of 0.2 due to potential focus on body awareness and sensory experience, which may involve breathing techniques common in meditation. However, the metadata does not explicitly mention any specific breathing exercises, reducing the confidence and score for this category.\n\nOther categories were considered, such as 'Yoga' or 'Stretching,' but there is no evidence of physical postures or flexibility training, clearly excluding these categories."
