  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.95,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is classified as 'Beginner' due to the very nature of guided meditation. The exercises involve sitting or lying down in a comfortable position and following auditory guidance to focus and relax the mind. This requires almost no physical movement, no coordination, or balance, making it accessible for users who are completely new to physical activity. The tags and description explicitly mention it being suitable for beginners, further supporting this classification.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.95,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as 'Light' because the entire session involves sitting still, which is physically undemanding. There is no emphasis on energy expenditure, intensity, or cardiovascular exertion as evident from the metadata focusing on meditation and mental focus. The short duration of 15 minutes also contributes to this classification as it limits the physical demand on the individual.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.95,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is mostly aligned with 'Beginner' but also includes 'Intermediate' and 'Advanced' levels due to the emphasis on mental discipline rather than physical capability. Meditation can be practiced by individuals at any physical fitness level, and the comments indicate it is beneficial for various life challenges, such as sobriety and healing from illness. The workout encourages mental practice, open to users at any stage of their physical fitness journey, aligning with a broad user base as seen in the metadata referencing conscious and mindful living. The intermediate and advanced levels have milder alignments to cater to those more familiar with meditation techniques or seeking mental challenges."
