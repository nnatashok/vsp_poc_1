  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Meditation' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This conclusion is drawn from multiple pieces of metadata indicating a focus on meditation practice. Specifically, the title '10 MIN Guided Meditation To Clear Your Mind & Start New Positive Habits' explicitly mentions guided meditation. The description reinforces this with '10 minute mindful meditation will give you the mental clarity...', and further supports meditation as the focus by directing users to a dedicated meditation channel. Tags such as '#Meditation' and '#GuidedMeditation' also strongly suggest this primary focus.\n\nAlthough the channel is named 'Boho Beautiful Yoga' and promotes yoga content, the individual video's focus on meditation is clear. The minor presence of 'Yoga' in the category list, with a score of 0.3, accounts for the overall yoga branding and repeated mention of yoga journeys alongside meditation in the video description, as well as the channel's typical content. However, the video's specific content is primarily meditation, leading to this weighting."
