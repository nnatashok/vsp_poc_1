  "vibesExplanation": "The workout conveys a strong 'Warrior Workout' vibe due to its 'killer HIIT' nature, emphasizing high-intensity intervals (30 sec on, 10 sec off) with demanding exercises like burpees, mountain climbers, and high knees. The use of words like 'KILLER', 'push it to your limit', and 'burn calories together' in the description, alongside a no-excuses mentality, supports this vibe. This aligns with primal, intense energy geared towards unleashing one's inner beast. \n\nThe 'Firestarter' vibe is also present, as the workout is fast-paced, explosive, and condensed into a 20-minute session, signifying a short yet devastating routine. The absence of equipment allows for a focus on rapid transitions and high-paced cardio movements, earning this vibe an 0.8 score.\n\nLastly, an 'Endorphin Wave' vibe comes into play, supported by user comments that highlight emotional turnaround and elevated energy levels. The workout's structure, featuring a mix of cardio and bodyweight strength moves, fosters a feel-good steady build, although this is less distinct than the primary vibes, hence a 0.6 score."
