  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized by being a steady 10-minute cardio session, which creates sustained energy and can elevate mood, matching the 'Endorphin Wave' vibe. User comments highlight that the workout has a consistent pace and provides a mood uplift ('Love how the cardio stays consistent' and 'After finishing this quick 10-min workout I suddenly want to do more'), justifying a score of 0.7.\n\nAdditionally, the absence of jumping and the no-equipment, consistent nature suggests a repetitive, focused approach typical of 'The Meditative Grind.' As it is described as a 'super sweaty' full-body workout, it aligns well with maintaining a steady state over the entire session. The comments from users enjoying a simple, repeatable routine ('simplicity of it is pure gold' and \u2018consistent throughout the workout\u2019) enhances this classification, scored at 0.65.\n\nHigh confidence results from strong user feedback aligned with descriptions, lacking uncertainty, and non-disruptive, fluid features in its execution."
