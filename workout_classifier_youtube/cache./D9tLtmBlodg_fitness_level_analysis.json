  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This guided meditation involves very basic techniques\u2014primarily involving sitting or lying down, relaxing, and breathing deeply. The metadata consistently describes it as suitable for beginners, mentioning low complexity actions like 'get into a comfortable position, close your eyes, relax, and breathe deeply.' Tags such as 'Meditation for beginners' support the low technique difficulty level, along with the channel's focus on providing accessible meditative content for broad audiences.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 1.0,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is clearly 'Light' because the meditation involves no physical exertion or movement. The focus is on mental relaxation and mindfulness, which does not require significant energy expenditure. The duration, although over 40 minutes, does not increase physical effort since it is a passive activity designed to induce relaxation, further indicated by phrases like 'a relaxed but aware state.'",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The meditation is primarily aimed at beginners, as stated in the tags and description. However, relaxation and mindfulness practices can benefit all fitness levels, including 'Intermediate' and 'Advanced', as they provide mental and emotional benefits rather than physical fitness improvements. The lack of physical activity means it remains highly accessible, but it can also serve as part of a routine for more experienced practitioners looking to enhance their mental peace and focus. The extended duration slightly challenges complete beginners to maintain focus for over 40 minutes, warranting inclusion of higher fitness levels."
