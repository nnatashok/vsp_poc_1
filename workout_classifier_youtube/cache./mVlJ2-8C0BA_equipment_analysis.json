  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "This workout clearly requires dumbbells, as explicitly indicated by the video title, description, and tags. The title '30 Min FULL BODY DUMBBELL WORKOUT To Burn Fat' emphasizes the use of dumbbells as the central equipment. The description repetitively mentions it as a \"dumbbell workout\" and lists exercises such as 'single-hand rows', 'sumo squats', 'shoulder presses', and 'tricep extensions' that typically involve dumbbells. Tags such as 'dumbbell workout', 'full body dumbbell workout', and 'home dumbbell workout' further reinforce the focus on dumbbells. Additionally, user comments consistently reference the use of specific weights (e.g., 10lb and 8lb dumbbells) during the workout. These elements collectively contribute to a very high confidence score of 1 for dumbbells being required for the workout."
