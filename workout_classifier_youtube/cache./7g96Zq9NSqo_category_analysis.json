  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Meditation' with a high confidence score of 1.0. This conclusion is drawn from several strong indicators within the metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'Guided Meditation For Healing & Recovery,' and the tags such as 'meditation', 'guided meditation', and 'mindful meditation' strongly reinforce this classification.\n\nThe description provides further details, indicating that the video is a 'fifteen minute guided meditation' aimed at healing and recovery, which aligns with meditation practices. The comments also reflect users' experiences with meditation, quoting phrases like 'such a blissful meditation practice' and indicating personal benefits related to healing and mental peace.\n\nConsidering the channel 'Boho Beautiful Yoga,' which prominently features meditations and yoga, there is consistency with the type of content they regularly produce, reinforcing the categorization as 'Meditation.' No evidence suggests other workout activities such as yoga or stretching, despite the channel's name, since the video focuses solely on meditation practices."
