  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises listed in the comments such as pushup knee drive, crunches, plank, and squats are basic movements that are easy to perform, requiring minimal coordination, especially given the focus on bodyweight and calisthenics. The presence of moves like 'plank lean left and right' and 'knee drive' add some complexity, indicating a light involvement of coordination and balance, thus extending to the lower end of the Intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 11:38 aligns with a short, intense session, typically involving condensed, consistent effort as indicated by 'shredded', 'burn fat', and references to a cutting routine. The exercise sequence described with 45-second rounds and 30 seconds rest aligns with Moderate to lower Challenging energy expenditures, especially with the bodyweight-only focus and circuit format.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique difficulty leaning towards Beginner but incorporating some Intermediate elements, along with a Moderate to lower Challenging effort difficulty, this workout is most suitable for Beginners transitioning to Intermediate. It accommodates a wide range due to modifiable intensity (e.g., adjusting pace) and bodyweight focus. Advanced level inclusion, albeit low, accounts for increasing execution intensity or incorporating advanced form corrections."
