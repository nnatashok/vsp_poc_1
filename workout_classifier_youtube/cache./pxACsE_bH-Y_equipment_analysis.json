  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The main piece of equipment needed for this workout is a stability/Swiss ball, commonly referred to as a 'birth ball' or 'birthing ball' in the context of the video. This is explicitly mentioned in the title ('Birth Ball Exercises For Easy Delivery') and is consistently reinforced throughout the tags ('birth ball', 'birthing ball exercises') and the description. The emphasis on preparing for delivery with the help of a birth ball indicates that the stability/Swiss ball is not only central to the exercises demonstrated but is central to achieving the intended benefits of the workout. Therefore, the confidence level is set at 0.95, indicating very high confidence that this equipment is required for the video."
