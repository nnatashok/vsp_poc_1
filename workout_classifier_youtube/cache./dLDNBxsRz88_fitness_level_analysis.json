  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "This meditation video is suitable for users at a 'Beginner' level due to its simplistic technique and low physical demand. Guided meditation primarily requires mental focus and relaxation, aligning with a Beginner level. Given the 27-minute duration and the possibility that users may need some familiarity with meditation to maintain focus, a slight score is assigned to 'Intermediate', acknowledging that some users may have practiced meditation before but it's not physically demanding. The channel's focus confirms this as it caters to users interested in mindfulness and stress management, rather than athletic performance."
