  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe selected is \"The Zen Flow\" with a high confidence score of 0.8. This is supported by comments describing the yoga session as meditative, breathing-focused, and emphasizing intentionality over intensity, as seen in user comments like \"Yoga is meditation\" and \"Charlie always emphasizes breathing throughout.\" The description highlights a vinyasa flow that is steady and all-levels friendly, suitable for daily use, further supporting this vibe.\n\n\"The Groove Session\" was also selected with a score of 0.6, as the instructor's style is noted to be playful and creative, evoking a sense of fun and expressive movement. The channel and class descriptions emphasize creativity and playfulness, which aligns with elements of a groove session.\n\n\"The Rhythmic Powerhouse\" was considered with a lower score of 0.4 due to the presence of vinyasa flow and posture-based sequences, which involve coordinated movements with a focus on strength. However, the overall intensity described leans more towards flow and meditation rather than power, hence the moderate score."
