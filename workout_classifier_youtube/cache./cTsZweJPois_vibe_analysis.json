The repeated phrases like \"beginner pilates\" and \"return to the basics\" in tags and description reinforce this classification, justifying a high score of 0.75.\n\nSecondly, the vibe of \"Zen Flow\" is evident as the workout is described as relaxing, intentional, and aiding posture, which aligns with grounding, breath-centered qualities associated with this vibe. This is also supported by user comments expressing feelings of relaxation and emotional release during the workout, warranting a score of 0.7.\n\nLastly, there's an element of \"Reboot Workout\" vibe, as the tags and comments imply a gentle, refreshing session suitable for beginners aiming to feel good and refreshed.
