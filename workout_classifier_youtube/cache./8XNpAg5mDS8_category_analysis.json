  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified primarily as 'Stretching' due to multiple explicit indications in the title, description, and tags. The title '25 min FULL BODY STRETCH' explicitly refers to stretching, as does the repeated use of the word 'stretch' in the tags and description. The focus on relaxation, flexibility, and stress relief aligns with stretching goals, further reinforcing this category. \n\n'Yoga' is also selected as a secondary category, although with a slightly lower score, due to references in the tags such as 'madfit yoga', '25 min yoga', 'yoga video no talking', and 'stress relief yoga'. The description's hashtag #Yoga supports this selection, suggesting elements of yoga may be part of the routine. However, since direct instruction or typical yoga elements like breath work or meditation aren't highlighted, the score for Yoga is slightly less. \n\nOverall, the workout's emphasis on stretching for relaxation and flexibility, combined with less emphasis on traditional yoga practices, leads to these classifications."
