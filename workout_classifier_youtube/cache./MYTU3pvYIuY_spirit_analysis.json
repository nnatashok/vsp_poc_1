  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit due to several indicators. The title '40 MIN KILLER HIIT WORKOUT' and tags like 'intense hiit', 'super sweaty workout', and 'calorie killer' strongly suggest a fast-paced, vigorous session, which warrants a very high score of 0.95. The routine emphasizes intense activity with 50 seconds of work followed by a short 10-second rest, typical of intense HIIT protocols.\n\nA secondary classification is 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.75. The description outlines a disciplined circuit training format (50/10 work/rest), typical of structured workout sessions. Although the workout allows for customization (\"make this your OWN workout\"), the presence of a formal sequence indicates a structured approach.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant at a score of 0.6, as the workout likely involves rhythmic movements coordinated with a workout routine, although less emphasis is placed here compared to intensity and structure.\n\n'Sport & Agility', 'Soothing & Restorative', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were not considered relevant due to lack of focus on athletic training skills, recovery, or outdoor/environmental settings."
