  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video '10-Minute Yoga for Beginners | Daily Fitness | Saurabh Bothra' primarily aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, scoring an 0.8, a very high confidence level. The title and description emphasize a focus on relaxation and gentle yoga practices suitable for beginners, using terms like 'simple', 'gentle stretches', and 'mindful movements'. The description further supports this, discussing relaxation and stress reduction with simple poses to improve overall well-being. Comments reflect appreciation from older demographics citing pain relief and ease, underscoring the restorative nature of this session.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, scoring 0.6, is also relevant. The video encourages participants to 'ease into the practice' with foundational poses and 'focusing on breathing techniques', which implies smooth, continuous sequences typical in yoga, enhancing the mind-body connection.\n\nHigh-Energy & Intense, Structured & Disciplined, and Sport & Agility spirits were excluded due to the absence of high-intensity, methodical protocols, or sport-specific skills. Similarly, Outdoor & Adventure was irrelevant as the workout occurs indoors, with no mention of environmental challenges."
