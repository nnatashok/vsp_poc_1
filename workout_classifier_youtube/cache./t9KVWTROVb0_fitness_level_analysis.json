  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated as Beginner with a high confidence level. The workout primarily involves using an elliptical machine, which is straightforward and involves natural movements such as striding. The video title and description emphasize the workout as 'Beginner,' and the user comments support this classification as users with minimal experience find it approachable. The elliptical further supports low technique difficulty as it provides guided, repetitive movements requiring minimal coordination and balance.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.75,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified between Light and Moderate. At only 10 minutes long, the workout duration indicates a lower effort level, appropriate for beginners or those looking for a quick session. The pyramid-style intervals include a range of resistance levels, but the short overall timeframe and inclusion of multiple cooldown phases suggest that energy expenditure remains relatively low. Comments from users reinforce this, indicating that the exercise serves as a starter or supplemental activity, fitting within the 'Light' to 'Moderate' categories for overall effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level suggests strong alignment with Beginner, meeting the needs of users new to exercise or those starting modestly. This is supported by the video title, description, and user comments that highlight its accessibility to complete beginners. Additionally, the introduction of intervals and varying resistance levels, although within a manageable duration, also provides enough stimulus to mildly challenge slightly more experienced exercisers, justifying an Intermediate inclusion with reasonable confidence."
