    "5 years after this video was posted, and it&#39;s STILL relevant! I have a relatively strong core, and I find this workout challenging and Caroline&#39;s positivity contagious! \ud83d\ude01",
    "I met a girl in Sydney, she worked out 1 hours every morning on the floor and had been doing it for 20 + years - she was 72 and the strongest woman I have ever met.",
    "Found myself here after a sleepless night, had some negativity and anxiety lurking and I don\u2019t know what made me get up and roll out my mat but even tho some of the sets were absolutely messy and silly\u2014 I am so grateful I sat and focused on myself in a restorative way. It really shifted my perspective. Thanks Caroline.",
    "Going to do this today, thank you!!!  I tell my husband &quot;This woman! Oh my gosh... I always know i can do all those exercises and it is soo bugging! She works me out so hard!! &quot;  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR VIDEOS. They have helped me get back into shape after three years of grieving.",
    "I have a foot injury and grateful to find this video so I can still exercise at home!"
