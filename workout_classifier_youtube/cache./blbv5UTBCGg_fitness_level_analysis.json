These descriptions suggest minimal physical demand and coordination, suitable for a beginner audience.

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is a 10-minute pranayama (breathing exercises) session, explicitly targeted at beginners. Breathing exercises generally require low physical exertion, focusing more on relaxation and mental calmness rather than high energy. The tags include 'breathing exercises for relaxation' and 'pranayama for stress relief,' indicating a calm and low-energy session. Hence, the effort difficulty is rated as Light.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the low technique difficulty and light effort difficulty, the workout is highly suitable for beginners. The video's focus on guided, simple pranayama practice makes it accessible to even those with little to no fitness background. However, individuals with some yoga experience (Intermediate) may still find value in incorporating these breathing techniques for relaxation and stress management, thus scoring a moderate alignment with the Intermediate level."
