  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is categorized mainly under the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the emphasis on continuous, smoothly executed yoga sequences (vinyasa flow) that emphasize coordination and mind-body connection. This is evident from the description, which mentions 'a steady vinyasa flow with hip openers, backbends, standing balances, and side planks' and Charlie's 'playful style of vinyasa flow'. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong indicators of coordinated, rhythmic movements blended with music-driven pacing typically associated with flow. \n\nAdditionally, the workout embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit to a significant degree. Comments emphasize elements such as 'true yoga', 'breathing throughout', and feeling 'like a changed person', which align with the restorative effects of yoga. Moreover, the description's language about giving the body 'everything it needs to have a great day' suggests a holistic, nurturing approach. The score of 0.7 indicates a secondary but notable focus on relaxation and mental well-being.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to a lack of relevant cues, emphasizing the video\u2019s indoor yoga focus instead."
