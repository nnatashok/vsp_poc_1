  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is \"Stretching\", with a high score of 0.9. The title and description emphasize lower back stretches, explicitly designed to reduce stiffness and improve flexibility. The use of terms like \"gentle stretches\", \"static stretches\", and \"mobility exercises\" solidifies this categorization. Additionally, the description details various specific stretches, underlining the focus on stretching routines, especially suitable for beginners.\n\n\"Breathing exercises\" is also mentioned in the description, albeit with less emphasis, hence a moderate score of 0.4. The description includes \"deep breathing exercises and relaxation\", which are consistent with the elements of breathing exercises, although they are not the main focus.\n\nThe category \"Yoga\" is scored 0.3 as elements like \"child's pose\" are common in yoga practice. However, the main focus on physiotherapy-guided stretching limits the strength of the yoga classification. Overall, the video aligns more closely with a structured stretching routine than typical yoga practice.\n\nThe exclusion of other categories is based on the lack of relevant evidence. No mention or implication of equipment, aerobic exercise, or strength training excludes categories like \"Mat\", \"Body weight\", or \"Weight workout\"."
