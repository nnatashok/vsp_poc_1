  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"20 MIN KILLER HIIT Full Body Workout - No Equipment - No Repeat Cardio HIIT Home Workout\" explicitly states in the title and description that it requires 'no equipment.' The tags such as 'no equipment hiit' and 'bodyweight workout' reinforce the idea that this workout is intended to be performed solely with bodyweight exercises, without the need for any additional fitness equipment. The description further confirms this by listing exercises that are commonly bodyweight-based, such as burpees, jumping jacks, and various forms of squats and lunges. Additionally, the phrase 'Equipment: Bodyweight only' in the description solidifies the conclusion that no equipment is needed for this workout."
