  "channelTitle": "Declutter The Mind",
  "channelDescription": "Declutter The Mind is for the beginner, novice, and experienced meditator. \n\nIt\u2019s where people who want to clear, declutter and understand their minds come.\n\nIf you want to understand the mind, sit down and observe it. My goal is to help you observe it (much more easily and effectively) with guided meditations for mindfulness, anxiety, stress, focus, sleep deprivation, insomnia, depression and more.\n\nThis channel hopes to help you meditate without the \u201cwoo woo\u201d or any religious undertones. I want meditation to be viewed as and used as a practical tool for anyone.\n\nI understand and want to show that meditation is not a magic pill, it\u2019s a practice. \n\nThe benefits of introspection, meditation, philosophy, and self-reflection come with regular practice and it requires time, patience and consistency.\n\nAll of the guided meditation sessions are unique, and made by a 14+ year practitioner of mindfulness meditation. So enjoy! Be sure to leave a like/comment and subscribe.",

    "I love this session because the speaker understands the exact attention span of the user. The moment my mind wanders, the speaker tells that it\u2019s normal but bring it back to the breathing. Love the understanding and the synchronisation with the audiences\u2019 mind. Thankyou.",
    "When he says, &quot;release all focus&quot;, and I haven&#39;t been focusing, so I start focusing \ud83d\udc4d",
    "I felt so guilty every time I was called out because every single time my mind was wandering. Then he told me not to judge those thoughts because judging is thinking. Well goddamn.",
    "They ask me to leave a comment, I leave a comment. They absolutely deserve every thing needed to support their channel. They are good people. PERIOD."
