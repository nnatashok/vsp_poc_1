    "Nice delivery without annoying music. Her steady direct talking thru it is v helpful for the wandering mind",
    "I really appreciate how calm, straightforward, and practical this meditation is. I&#39;m not a fan of the woo woo type meditations out there so I&#39;m so grateful to have stumbled across this.",
    "This is how we develop, strengthen, root and ground ourselves in our breath, mind, &amp; body and in the present moment.<br><br>Return to the breath, observe thoughts AND feelings, and without judging them, let them go, bringing the attention back to the breath.<br><br>Truly amazing! <br>Great reminders!!<br>And yes, I too love how she guides us!",
    "This is the first breathing meditation I&#39;ve been able to finish because I felt like you described what to do in a way I could imagine, so i could find a path for my attitude towards the breath. I wasn&#39;t stuck overthinking how I was breathing. Really helped my gastritis in my upper abdomen, thank you",
    "It&#39;s crazy how struggling it can be to just breathe. This is relaxing and helpful. I prefer this over yoga"
