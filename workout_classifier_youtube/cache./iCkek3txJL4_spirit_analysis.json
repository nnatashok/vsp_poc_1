  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative,' evidenced by the emphasis on 'flexibility, mobility and relaxation' in the title and description. The routine is described as a 'daily stretch' that helps with 'muscles recover,' reinforcing the restorative nature. Viewer comments also highlight stress reduction and post-exercise relief, aligning with this spirit. Given these strong indicators, a score of 1.0 is assigned to 'Soothing & Restorative.'\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is the secondary spirit due to phrases such as 'a sequence of different full body exercises' and the mention of music selection influencing the 'vibe of the video.' This suggests a flowing, coordinated routine, albeit with less emphasis than the soothing aspects. Thus, 'Flow & Rhythm' receives a score of 0.6.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are not applicable here due to the focus on relaxation and ease, making this an unlikely match for intense or highly structured qualities."
