  "vibesExplanation": "The video showcases a Pilates workout led by Jessica Valant, offering a structured, no-repeat, full-body experience in a short 10-minute window. This aligns strongly with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe, as Pilates is technique-driven and focuses on skill development (score 0.75). The description highlights Valant's expertise as a physical therapist and Pilates instructor, emphasizing her instructional quality and attention to proper execution. Additionally, the workout's intention to energize and motivate, as well as comments mentioning feeling refreshed and recharged in just 10 minutes, suggest elements of 'The Reboot Workout' vibe (score 0.5), as it provides a total-body refresh without high intensity. The absence of loud music and emphasis on explanation rather than exertion exclude high-energy vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter.' The confidence level is moderate due to the blend of clear Pilates instruction and the refreshing nature of the short workout."
