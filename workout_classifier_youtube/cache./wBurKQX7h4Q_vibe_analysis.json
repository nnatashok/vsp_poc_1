  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is best classified with the primary vibe 'The Firestarter', receiving a score of 0.9. This is due to its high-intensity nature, indicated by terms like 'High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)' and 'fat burning'. The 20-minute duration suggests short, explosive workouts, while comments reflect intense, impactful sessions typical of 'The Firestarter'.\n\nThe vibe 'The Meditative Grind' scores 0.7, reflecting the repetitive, endurance-building nature of indoor cycling. Comments highlight regular use and the steady, consistent rhythm ('3X a week'), elements of zoning-in characteristic of this vibe.\n\nLastly, 'The Endorphin Wave' is appropriate with a score of 0.6, supported by user feedback describing motivational and transformative experiences, indicating a steady build of energy and mood enhancement. Other potential vibes like 'The Competitor' and 'The Nightclub Workout' were considered but excluded due to lack of direct gamification elements or emphasis on music-led enthusiasm."
