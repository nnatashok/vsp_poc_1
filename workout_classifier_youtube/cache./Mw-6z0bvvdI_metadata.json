  "channelDescription": "Quick + effective home workouts that get results! Like stronger than you've ever been kind of results. \n\nI'm Lindsey Bomgren, Certified Personal Trainer + Pre-and-Postnatal Fitness Instructor, and mom of 3 littles. \n\nAs a busy mom, I\u2019m all about quick and effective home workouts! I truly feel that doing the physically hard stuff makes you more capable of handling all the mentally challenging things that come at you daily. I don\u2019t film workout videos to give you six pack abs or a nice butt. I film workout videos because I know fitness makes me a better wife, mother, friend and human and I want to share that with you. \n\nI pray you find the workout inspiration + motivation you were seeking when you stumbled over here. Give me 10-30 minutes of your time today and I bet you\u2019ll come back for more tomorrow!\n\nPray often. Move your body. Eat your veggies. Love others + yourself.\n",

    "I really loved this! I&#39;ve wanted to add more pilates workouts to my routine but find I&#39;m missing something that I get from my strength workouts. This was so perfect! I&#39;m doing this as part of the 3-2-1 playlist you created and would love more like that--still more strength workouts but paired with power pilates. Maybe a thought for a future program you create \ud83e\udd17. Thank you for all you do!",
    "Wow! Loved the balance and endurance work.",
    "Love this workout!  Today I completed two of your pilates workouts and I feel great. Will keep doing them regularly combined with the Strength and Hit workouts. Thank you!!!!!!!<a href=\"UCIiI9tAbgvSPPL_50gefFtw/ZDQTZKvLKInWgwPV5IXgCA\"></a>",
    "I\u2019m so glad I found your channel! Especially as a fellow Lindsey (so when you say to yourself \u201ccome on Lindsey\u201d it really feels like you\u2019re speaking to me LOL). Your barre workouts are what drew me to your channel and while I\u2019ve done a lot of your challenges, I really love your barre and Pilate classes! Please please do more!",
    "This is my favorite Pilates workout so far!! Dripping sweat!! Was a struggle for me as my vertigo is back, but I made it through. I\u2019ll definitely repeat this one once my vertigo calms down. \u2764\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude05"
