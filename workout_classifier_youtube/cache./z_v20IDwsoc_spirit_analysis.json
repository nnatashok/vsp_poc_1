  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is strongly aligned with the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit, as indicated by the title '10 minute Stretching Routine' and the emphasis on releasing tight back muscles and back pain relief in the description. Stretching is inherently gentle and focuses on relaxation and recovery, reflected in the channel's delivery of simple and well-guided routines noted in the comments. Thus, it earns a score of 0.9 for this spirit, indicating a very strong match.\n\nThe tags and description mention 'mobility flow' and 'dynamic stretches', suggesting elements of continuity and coordination, aligning with \"Flow & Rhythm\". The \"follow along\" nature implies a structured sequence with rhythmical elements, supporting a secondary classification with a score of 0.65, recognizing these rhythmic components.\n\nOther spirits such as \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Sport & Agility\" are excluded due to the video's focus on relaxation and flexibility rather than aggressive physical exertion or sports-specific skills."
