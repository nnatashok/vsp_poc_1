  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Structured & Disciplined' due to the clear mention of 'run and recovery intervals' that suggest a systematic approach designed for beginners. Additionally, the segments like 'Warm Up' and 'Cool Down' further indicate a structured routine, justifying a high score of 0.7. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is evident from the integration of music throughout the workout and the smooth progression from warm-up to workout, aligning with the 'follow along' format, which supports a score of 0.7. 'High-Energy & Intense' is also relevant given the inclusion of '15 minute HIIT run' in the tags, and phrases such as 'get sweaty,' though it's moderated by the beginner-friendly nature of the workout, resulting in a score of 0.6. The absence of outdoor elements and the focus on indoor treadmill running preclude the 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit."
