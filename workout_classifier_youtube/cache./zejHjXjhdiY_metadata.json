    "It`s great to see the lady on the left doing the modified (easier) versions of some exercises for those who can`t do the &quot;standard&quot; one. Really appreciate it! Thank you",
    "She says at the end, &quot;You can do this workout anytime, anywhere!&quot; And I thought, &quot;as long as you&#39;re inside your own place if you&#39;re on virus lock down Day 6 like I am, but I get your point.&quot; Then they said they would be here for me... and I kinda got a warm fuzzy. For real. Thanks.",
    "I&#39;ve been so grateful for PopSugar this month as I stockpile some extra fitness time between gym workouts so that I can enjoy the holidays guilt-free. I did this workout today in my kitchen tonight, in my pajamas, while waiting for the royal icing to set on my sugar cookies. I love Taylor&#39;s efficient but effective workouts and I know I&#39;ll be feeling this a little in my legs tomorrow.",
    "I honestly have been too lazy to workout for the past few months. I just started to do popsugarfitness workout videos a couple of weeks ago and I feel great. I guess I just needed some motivation and believe in myself. my goal is to at least lose close to a hundred pounds by the end of 2020. I know I can do this and never give up on anything. I am just tired of being unfit.",
    "Great total body, arms, legs, abs and bit of cardio + strength mixed in- perfect for a 30minute workout. I also regularly rotate Taylor\u2019s other cardio workout. I love how she uses the usual HIIT breaks fir active recovery abs. Keep the total body cardio, toning 30 minute workouts coming Anna :)"
