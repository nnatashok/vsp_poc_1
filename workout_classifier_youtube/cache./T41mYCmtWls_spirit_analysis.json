  "spiritsExplanation": "The video title '10 min Morning Yoga Stretch for Beginners - Energy Boost Yoga' clearly indicates a focus on 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits. The use of 'morning yoga flow' and 'vinyasa flow' in the tags emphasizes the smooth, ongoing movements typical of a flow-based practice, supporting a high confidence score for 'Flow & Rhythm' (0.8). Additionally, the description mentions 'energy boosting' and 'full body stretch,' which implies gentle movements designed to enliven and restore, aligning with 'Soothing & Restorative' (0.7). The description's mention of 'no props needed' and targeting 'aches and pains' further bolster the restorative aspect. Comments describe feeling rejuvenated, like \"helped a lot\" and \"makes yoga a daily habit,\" indicating a positive, calming effect. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' are less relevant given the beginner-friendly focus and absence of high-intensity markers."
