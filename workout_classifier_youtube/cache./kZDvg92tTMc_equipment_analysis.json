  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"30 MIN PUMPING CARDIO WORKOUT | Full Body - No Equipment at Home\" clearly indicates in the title and throughout the metadata that no equipment is needed to perform this workout. The description explicitly states \"no equipment needed\" and lists exercises such as jumping jacks, push-ups, and squats, which are typically bodyweight exercises. The video tags, including \"no equipment workout\" and \"bodyweight workout,\" further reinforce that the workout is designed to be done without any equipment. Additionally, user comments and the workout's focus on being an at-home cardio session suggest it is intended to be accessible without requiring any fitness gear.
