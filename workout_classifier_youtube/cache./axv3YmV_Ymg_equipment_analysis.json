  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "This workout video is explicitly designed to be a no-equipment calisthenics routine, as indicated by both the title and description. The title \"20 Min Calisthenics Workout | No Equipment | All Levels\" clearly states that no equipment is needed. The description further supports this by stating: \"You can do this full body workout at home and without any equipment! No bars, no parallettes etc. needed. The only thing you need is yourself.\" The tags reinforce this, with phrases such as \"calisthenics workout no equipment\" and \"full body workout at home\". Additionally, the top comments and channel description do not mention or imply the need for equipment. Therefore, this is a bodyweight-only workout, and no additional equipment is required."
