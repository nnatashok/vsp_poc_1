  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is \"The Firestarter\" due to the explicit reference to \"EXTREME FAT BURNING HIIT CARDIO WORKOUT\" in both the title and description. The workout is short (5 minutes) and framed as 'extreme', suggesting a fast-paced, high-intensity session typical of The Firestarter vibe. The significant emphasis on intensity and the challenge to \"shock the system\" support this classification, earning it a high score of 0.9.\n\n\"The Warrior Workout\" is also relevant given the emphasis on resilience and power with phrases like \"POWER THROUGH!\" and \"I won't quit, so don't leave me hanging!\" indicating a motivational, sweat-inducing workout experience, fitting Warrior elements, scoring 0.75.\n\n\"The Adrenaline Rush\" is considered given the no-breaks nature and unpredictable challenge described in the comments and workout flow, indicating intense full-body exertion and rapid heart rate, earning a score of 0.65. While the workout suggests a rapid and immersive experience consistent with Adrenaline Rush, the shorter duration makes it somewhat less fitting than The Firestarter."
