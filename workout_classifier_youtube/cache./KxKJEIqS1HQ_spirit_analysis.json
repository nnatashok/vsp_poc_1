  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.8. The video title and description emphasize 'interval run workout' which involves varying speeds and effort levels, characteristic of intense cardiovascular workouts. The inclusion of terms like 'pyramid style workout' and phrases such as 'all varying in speed and length' support the high-energy classification due to the continuous change in intensity levels which are designed to push limits. \n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is also a significant spirit with a score of 0.7. This is evidenced by the precise 'pyramid' interval structure outlined in the workout description, which requires discipline to follow through. \n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is present to a lesser extent, scored at 0.4, due to the nature of running, which often involves repetitive, rhythmic motion especially when following a paced workout. However, it is not the primary focus, as the intensity and structured interval format take precedence. \n\nOther spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' do not fit as well given the indoor setting and the focus on interval intensity rather than outdoor exploration or agility drills."
