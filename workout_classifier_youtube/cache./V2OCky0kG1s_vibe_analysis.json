  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Reboot Workout' due to its emphasis on low-impact exercises and accessibility for beginners, as highlighted by the description's mention of 'low impact with no jumping,' which aims for a 'heart rate up' yet approachable session. This aligns with the idea of a 'deep stretch, low stress, total-body refresh.' The 'The Reboot Workout' is a strong match (0.75) as it aligns with the goal of energizing while being gentle, as echoed by comments appreciating its simplicity and effectiveness.\n\n'Comfort Moves' is also relevant (score 0.65), highlighted by user comments from a pregnant participant appreciating its accessibility. This vibe matches the 'safe, cozy, feel-good movement' aspect of the workout, especially due to its low-impact nature.\n\nFinally, 'The Meditative Grind' is included with moderate confidence (0.4) since the workout consists of repetitive, simple cardio movements that allow participants to zone in and maintain a steady rhythm, although the low duration and mild intensity make this a secondary vibe.\n\nThe channel's focus on inclusive, varied workouts supports these selections. Intensity indicators are mild, which excludes more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout.'"
