  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is highly representative of 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its nature as a short, intense HIIT session focused on fat burning and explosive movements. The mention of exercises like 'Explosive jacks' and a format of short work/rest cycles (30s each) supports a quick, high-energy vibe, making it a near-perfect match (score: 0.9). \n\nAdditionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' is somewhat applicable here. The workout promises a 'super sweaty' session that suggests a building of energy over the 15-minute duration, combined with the positive effects noted in comments about feeling strong and healthy post-exercise. This vibe scores 0.7 as the element of steady energy build and feel-good movement is secondary to the explosive nature of the workout.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor' are less applicable as there's no emphasis on primal energy or competitive elements, instead focusing on individual challenge and self-paced exertion."
