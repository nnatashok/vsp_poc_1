  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "At 60 minutes, with alternating high-intensity and rest periods, the workout demands increased cardiovascular and muscular effort, especially given the continuous movement over such a duration. Descriptions emphasize fatigue and 'afterburn,' aligning with moderate to challenging effort levels, especially for deconditioned individuals or those over 50.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Despite the challenging length, beginners can modify the workout intensity by using lighter weights or no weights, which the instructor accommodates by providing options, maintaining inclusivity. A duration of 60 minutes makes it suitable for intermediates who can handle the complete workout with moderate load. Advanced users can intensify with heavier weights and engage fully during high-intensity intervals."
