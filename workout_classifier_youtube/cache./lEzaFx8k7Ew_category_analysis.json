  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary focus of this workout video is on the 4-7-8 breathing technique, as explicitly stated in the title and reiterated through tags such as '478 breathing,' and 'breathing exercise.' The description elaborates on this breathing method's relaxation benefits and connection to reducing anxiety, assigning 'Breathing exercises' a score of 0.9 due to the strong alignment with this category. The channel's focus on meditation, as per its name 'Hands-On Meditation,' and additional tags like 'mindful breathing meditation' indicate a secondary element of 'Meditation,' leading to a moderate score of 0.6. Furthermore, 4-7-8 breathing is mentioned as part of 'many meditation and yoga practices' in the description, which suggests a mild connection to 'Yoga,' contributing to a lower score of 0.3. The emphasis on relaxation and breathing over physical postures or stretches excludes categories like 'Stretching' or 'Mat.'"
