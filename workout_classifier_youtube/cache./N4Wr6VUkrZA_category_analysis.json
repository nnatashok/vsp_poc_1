  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Calisthenics' and 'Body weight' based on several strong indicators. The video title 'The Perfect Workout to Start Calisthenics for Beginners' explicitly mentions calisthenics, which is confirmed by the repeated emphasis on calisthenics in the tags and description. Specifically, tags like 'calisthenics', 'beginner calisthenics', and 'calisthenics exercises' reinforce this classification. Furthermore, the description highlights the focus on calisthenics for beginners, targeting core strength, balance, and overall muscle development using bodyweight exercises, thus associating it with calisthenics principles. Additionally, the video includes exercises like diamond push-ups and chin-ups, which are typical calisthenics and bodyweight exercises, as mentioned in the comments. The channel's overall focus on calisthenics further supports this classification. The score for 'Calisthenics' is 0.9 due to the strong presence of calisthenics elements, while 'Body weight' is scored at 0.7, acknowledging the body weight focus without exclusive calisthenics context."
