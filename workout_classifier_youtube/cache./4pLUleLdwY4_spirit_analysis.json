  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of the video is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a strong confidence of 0.95 and a perfect score match of 1.0. This is derived from both the title 'Meditation for Anxiety', and the description that emphasizes 'relief from anxiety, stress, and energetic imbalance' through meditation, which are key elements of restorative practices. Keywords such as 'guides you through a simple at home meditation', 'tune into your breath', and 'soften' suggest a focus on calmness and relaxation. The tags such as 'meditation', 'yoga for stress relief', and 'healing yoga' further reinforce this spirit, stressing the gentle, healing, and recovery-focused nature of the practice. The comments also reflect a soothing impact on participants, talking about stress reduction and emotional peace, confirming this classification. Other potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are not applicable due to the lack of emphasis on dynamic movement or technical precision."
