  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled 'Bedtime Yoga Stretch to Release Tension and Stress,' which suggests it focuses on relaxation and gentle stretching exercises typical in yoga routines. The tags consistently reference yoga and relaxation, aligning with a floor-based practice where a mat is typically employed for comfort and stability. The description emphasizes a soothing and gentle yoga class, further reinforcing the likelihood of a mat being used. There is no mention of any other equipment like blocks or straps, and user comments reflect emotional and mental relief derived from body awareness exercises, which again are most comfortably conducted on a mat. Therefore, the mat is very likely required with a high confidence score of 0.9."
