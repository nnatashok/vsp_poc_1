  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified for this workout is 'The Firestarter' with a score of 0.9. This is supported by the short, intense duration of 10 minutes emphasizing fat burning and high-intensity, as indicated by terms like 'fat burning,' 'high intensity workouts,' and 'HIIT Workout.' The description highlights quick results and calorie burning, both characteristic of explosive, fast-paced workouts. \n\n'The Warrior Workout' is also relevant, with a score of 0.75, due to the primal, sweat-dripping intensity observed in user comments describing the workout as 'intensive' and the moment of realization when the initial perceived intensity is revealed as just a warm-up, indicating a demanding, beastly workout structure. \n\nLastly, 'The Endorphin Wave' is scored at 0.6 due to the mention of endurance building and the positive, transformative experience described by users who note significant weight loss and improvement after persistent engagement with the workout. This suggests a steady build of energy and feel-good movement over time. \n\nConfidence is high given the explicit emphasis on intensity and immediacy in the video's content and user experiences."
