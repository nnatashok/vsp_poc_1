  "vibesExplanation": "The video predominantly embodies 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe with a score of 0.7 due to the focus on technique and the precision required in Pilates, as indicated by comments about challenging movements like the swan dive and the appreciation for Nicole's clear guidance. This aligns with the technique-driven, skill-building essence of 'The Masterclass Workout'. The 'Zen Flow' vibe is also present, with a score of 0.6, emphasized by comments appreciating the workout as a calming yet challenging experience, and mentions of breathing and mindfulness in the workout, resonating with descriptions of yoga-like flows. Additionally, the presence of 'The Groove Session' with a score of 0.4 is supported by the expressive and fluid nature of Pilates movements, although this aspect is less dominant. The workout does not align with more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' as the focus is not on high-intensity, but rather on form and fluidity."
