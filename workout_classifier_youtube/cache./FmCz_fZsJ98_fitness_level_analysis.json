  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is primarily 'Beginner' due to the focus on simple, compound movements and balance exercises suitable for seniors and beginners. The video emphasizes going at your own pace and becoming comfortable with movements, suggesting simplicity. The use of lightweight dumbbells (5 pounds) further suggests that the exercises do not require advanced coordination or complex movements. However, because the exercise targets balance and uses free weights, there is a minor element of intermediate complexity, accounting for the 'Intermediate' rating.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is mainly 'Light' since the workout is designed for seniors and beginners, emphasizing low impact and osteoporosis-friendly exercises. The session is 28 minutes long, but the presence of a senior audience and focus on low-intensity strength and balance exercises support a lower effort level. There is a slight 'Moderate' score due to the continuous 30-minute duration and the use of weights, which add slightly to the physical demand.",
