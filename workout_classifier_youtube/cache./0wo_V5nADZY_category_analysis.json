  "categoriesExplanation": "The title '30 Minute Full Body HIIT Workout at Home with Weights - 30 Min Dumbbell HIIT Workouts for Fat Loss' explicitly mentions 'HIIT' and 'weights', indicating a high-intensity interval training workout involving dumbbells. The tags reinforce this with phrases like 'hiit workout with weights' and 'dumbbell hiit workout'. The description further supports the inclusion of HIIT due to references to fat loss, a common goal for HIIT activities. The channel is known for fitness routines, strengthening the classification. Thus, HIIT is assigned a score of 0.9, suggesting very high confidence. Weight workout is given a 0.7 score due to the mention of dumbbells, indicating a clear yet secondary element. Other categories, such as 'Mat' or 'Body weight', are excluded as the primary focus is on HIIT with weights."
