  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video involves a variety of exercises that range in complexity. Many movements, such as sumo squats, deadlifts, curls, and crunch variations, are accessible to beginners but require a good understanding of form to prevent injury. Exercises like single-leg Romanian deadlifts and prone swimmers involve more balance and coordination, placing them at an intermediate level. The execution of compound movements with weights suggests an advanced understanding of body mechanics, although modifications and self-selecting dumbbell weights allow broader accessibility.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves 45 minutes of continuous strength exercises with minimal rest, making it moderately to very challenging. A no-repeat structure with exercises performed for 60 and 40 seconds with short rest periods (20 and 10 seconds, respectively) increases cardiovascular demand and muscular endurance. The use of heavy dumbbells and optional resistance bands also raises intensity. Overall, the effort is challenging but manageable by adjusting weights and technique.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The combination of moderately complex techniques and the physically demanding nature of the workout suggests it is best suited for intermediate fitness levels, with substantial elements also appropriate for more advanced users. The workout's duration exceeds 40 minutes, typically not suitable for beginners, and involves weighted exercises necessitating some prior experience to avoid injury. While advanced users will find the structure and intensity beneficial for a robust workout, intermediates can adjust weights or rest periods."
