  "vibesExplanation": "The selected workout video vibes primarily align with 'The Masterclass Workout', 'The Progression Quest', and 'The Disciplined Grind'. The workout focuses heavily on calisthenics, specifically targeting individual muscles through advanced exercises like handstands and muscle-ups, which suggest a technique-driven and skill-building approach typical of a masterclass (Score: 0.8). The emphasis on 'secret techniques' and 'step by step guided tutorials' as described in the video metadata further supports this assignment.\n\n'Progression Quest' is relevant here because the video mentions 'the most simplistic systematic approach to learning any calisthenics move,' indicating a methodology centered around incremental improvement and achieving long-term goals. This is reinforced by the structured nature of the exercises and mentions of 'progress' and 'build' in the tags (Score: 0.7).\n\nFinally, 'The Disciplined Grind' vibe is suggested by the rigorous and austere nature of calisthenics, as well as the high discipline required to execute exercises such as pistol squats and handstand push-ups, which are demanding and require regular, focused practice (Score: 0.65).\n\nThe metadata lacks elements characteristic of vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Groove Session,' which are typically more about fluidity and low-intensity movement, thus they were excluded. The high confidence (0.8) in these vibes is supported by the specific exercises and the instructional focus highlighted throughout the metadata and user comments."
