  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "Based on the video title 'Post Workout Stretch | Full Body | 15 Minutes of Stress Relief & Recovery' and the associated tags such as 'stretching exercises,' 'yoga,' and 'stretch yoga,' it is highly likely that a Mat is required for this workout. Mats are typically used in stretching and yoga exercises to provide comfort and support during floor-based movements. The comments describe the video as a stretching routine, suggesting a mat would be useful for sitting or lying positions. Therefore, the confidence level for requiring a Mat is very high at 0.8, as it is standard equipment for such exercises."
