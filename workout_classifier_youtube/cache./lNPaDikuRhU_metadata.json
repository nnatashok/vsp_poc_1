    "I\u2019ve been using your Pilates videos for about a year and I can\u2019t say enough good things about your teaching and workouts.  You explain the techniques and exercises so it\u2019s easy to understand and encourage to be at your level without guilt.  And I love that the workouts are 30 minutes or less.  It seems very doable and it\u2019s why I\u2019ve stayed with these workouts for so long.  I appreciate you offering these on YouTube!  Thank you so much!",
    "Really excellent gentle stretch. Your reminders to take care of ourselves and not go beyond comfort levels is priceless. Thank you and Let&#39;s Keep Moving!",
    "I love her! She\u2019s the Bob Ross of pilates",
    "I love all your \u201cgentle\u201d classes. Such good stretches."
