  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is specifically designed for stroke patients and highlights leg exercises that can be done from a chair. The description explicitly states, \"this 10-minute video guides you through a series of exercises you can easily do from the comfort of your chair,\" confirming that a chair is central and required for these exercises. Additionally, the focus on recovery and the target audience (stroke patients) further implies the need for stable seating to ensure safety and accessibility during the exercise routine. Hence, the confidence level for requiring a chair is very high."
