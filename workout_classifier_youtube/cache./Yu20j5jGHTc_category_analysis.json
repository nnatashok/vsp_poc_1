  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is primarily categorized as a 'Body weight' workout with a score of 0.8 due to the explicit mention of it being a 'no equipment full body workout' and detailed exercises mostly using body weight, such as push-ups, planks, lunges, and squats. The 'HIIT' category is also applicable with a score of 0.7 as the description and tags refer to 'hiit' and 'no repeat hiit,' while the workout structure involves short intervals of high intensity followed by rest. The inclusion of high intensity exercises like jump split lunges and burpees further supports this classification. The 'Mat' category is given a score of 0.5 because the workout mentions requiring just a mat, which is typical for mat exercises at home, though the primary focus is on body weight and HIIT elements. Other categories such as 'Weight workout' or 'Elliptical' were excluded due to the clear emphasis on bodyweight and interval style exercises without equipment."
