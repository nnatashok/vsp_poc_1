  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises in a Pilates abs workout generally involve basic core engagement and floor exercises, which align with beginner and intermediate technique difficulty. Pilates often includes elements of control and precision, which can elevate the difficulty slightly to intermediate level, but without complex movements, the primary classification remains beginner-friendly. The absence of equipment and the short duration also suggest a focus on fundamental techniques.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort required for a 6-minute workout is typically low to moderate. The short duration inherently suggests a lower physical demand, suitable for a light effort difficulty classification. However, as Pilates workouts can engage muscles deeply and effectively in a short period, moderate effort may also be applicable, especially for users not accustomed to core-intensive exercises. User comments suggest an all-over workout feel, indicating some level of exertion.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the beginner to intermediate technique and light to moderate effort difficulty, the workout is best classified for beginners with a strong consideration for intermediate users. Pilates focuses on precise movements that, while accessible, benefit from some level of coordination, aligning with both fitness levels. The short video duration ensures that even those with low fitness levels could attempt completion, though those slightly more conditioned might benefit more fully from its intensity."
