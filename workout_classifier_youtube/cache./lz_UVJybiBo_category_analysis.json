  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category is 'Meditation' with a score of 0.95. The video is titled 'Guided Meditation For Positive Vibrations | Gurudev' and is published on a channel specifically dedicated to meditation content, 'Meditations by Gurudev'. The title and tags include 'Meditation', 'Guided Meditation', and 'Mindfulness', which strongly suggest a focus on meditation. The description emphasizes meditation for reducing stress and anxiety, further supporting this classification. The second category, with a lower score of 0.3, is 'Breathing exercises'. This is suggested by the reference to 'Sudarshan Kriya', a known breathing technique, in the description. However, it is mentioned as part of a separate learning opportunity linked to the channel and is not the primary focus of this video. Thus, 'Breathing exercises' is included due to potential relevance but with low confidence."
