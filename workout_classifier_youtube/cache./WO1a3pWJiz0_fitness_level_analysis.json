  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises listed (e.g., single leg bridge, plank variations, bird dog) are mostly basic core strengthening movements. They require minimal coordination and are widely considered foundational exercises. Thus, the technique difficulty is mostly Beginner. The slight inclusion of Intermediate is due to exercises like side plank hip lifts which may require a touch more balance and coordination, particularly for deconditioned individuals.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort level is primarily Light, considering the 10-minute duration and the low-impact nature of the exercises designed for rehabilitation and gentle core strengthening. The video is aimed at pain relief and stability rather than high-intensity training, aligning with a low-to-moderate energy expenditure. A score of Moderate is considered because some users, especially those with low fitness levels, might find plank variations and other core exercises somewhat more demanding.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort assessments, this workout is highly suitable for Beginners, particularly those looking to relieve back pain and strengthen core muscles without intense demand. Intermediate aligns for individuals who may benefit from core improvement but are slightly more experienced. The workout's accessibility and the mention of it being used by people recovering from back issues indicate a strong fit for Beginners, but slight accommodation for Intermediates seeking rehab progress adds to its utility."
