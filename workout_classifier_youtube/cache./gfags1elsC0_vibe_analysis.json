  "vibesExplanation": "The video is classified under \"The Masterclass Workout\" and \"The Zen Flow\" vibes. Evidence for \"The Masterclass Workout\" comes from the focus on Pilates, which is typically technique-driven and emphasizes skill-building, consistent with the video's description and channel's emphasis on certified Pilates instruction. The inclusion of \"intermediate level\" in the title suggests a focus on developing expertise, aligning well with a Masterclass vibe, hence a high score of 0.8.\n\n\"The Zen Flow\" is also relevant, as Pilates often involves breath control and mindfulness akin to yoga. User comments mentioning enjoyment, relaxation, and the inclusion of stretches indicate a grounding, intentional approach, justifying a score of 0.6. \n\nThe data lacks indicators of intense physical exertion or competitive elements, excluding vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Competitor.\" Comments also appreciate the stress-free aspect of the workout, aligning more with a calming flow than a high-intensity session."
