  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled '15-Min Full-Body Stretching Routine' is primarily classified under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to its focus on gentle stretching and recovery. This is supported by the description emphasizing passive stretching, a slow pace, and the recommendation to use it as a post-exercise routine. Terms such as 'relaxing,' 'post-exercise practice,' and 'breathing techniques' further underscore its restorative nature, justifying a high score of 0.9 for this spirit.\n\nA secondary classification of 'Flow & Rhythm' is assigned with a moderate confidence score of 0.5. This is due to the structured sequence of movements and poses that might involve a degree of coordination and breathing rhythm as implied by comments praising the simplicity and smoothness of the routine. However, the primary emphasis remains on relaxation and recovery rather than a strong flow, hence the moderate score.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the workout's deliberate focus on simplicity and recovery rather than high intensity or agility drills."
