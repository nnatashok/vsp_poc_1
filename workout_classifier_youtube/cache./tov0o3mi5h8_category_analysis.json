  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified under 'Pilates' with very high confidence (score 0.95), as evident from multiple indicators in the metadata. The title, '15 min Pilates Workout for Beginners,' directly mentions 'Pilates,' which is reiterated in the tags such as 'pilates workout,' 'pilates for beginners,' and 'full body pilates.' The description emphasizes a 'Pilates Workout for Beginners,' designed to tone the core, abs, and legs. The channel 'Flow with Mira' is dedicated to Pilates, further supporting this classification. \nAdditionally, a secondary category of 'Mat' is considered with a moderate score (0.4), given that Pilates routines often rely on a mat for various exercises, as suggested by the tag 'mat pilates.' However, as the central focus is on Pilates, the score remains lower compared to the primary category. The other categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Body weight' were excluded due to the specific reference to Pilates as the workout form."
