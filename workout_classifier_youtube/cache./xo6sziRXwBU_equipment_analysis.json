  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a Pilates workout, which usually requires a mat for floor exercises to provide comfort and support. The channel description mentions that Lidia Mera is a certified Level 3 Pilates mat instructor, indicating the primary use of mats in her routines. Although the description does not explicitly mention any equipment, the focus on Pilates strongly suggests the use of a mat. Therefore, the confidence level for a mat is very high at 0.9. No other equipment is indicated by the metadata or user comments."
