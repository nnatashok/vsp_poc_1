    "I have been having really crippling anxiety these last few months and I was fully sobbing during this routine. There is something so cathartic and healing about just checking in with myself and giving myself space to just be. Thank you for this.",
    "Thank you. I started to cry when you said to connect with self and just observing the body and to be with self. I\u2019m a very sensitive person and I feel emotions more so than others and it\u2019s so overwhelming honestly all the time. And I recently lost a friend to chemotherapy and I feel broken and this has helped me relax, I feel like I can go to sleep tonight. Thank you.",
    "i have done this for the last couple of nights... and when i tell you i have never slept better i mean it. i have never slept so deeply and felt so good not only going to bed but also waking up. this is a game changer. thank you for giving us this\u2764",
    "Even if it wasn&#39;t the longest session, im proud that I still showed up for myself and made myself do yoga, thanks to you and your guidance \u2764",
    "I just finished this and I have no clue why I feel like crying but I&#39;ve been busting my butt to workout this year to have a healthier life, hearing your words and doing this just helped me mentally and emotionally, thank you so much"
