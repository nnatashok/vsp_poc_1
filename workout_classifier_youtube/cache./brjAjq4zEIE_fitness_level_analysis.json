  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a 15-minute morning yoga stretch, described as suitable for 'yoga beginners' in the tags and associated with phrases like 'easy to follow' in comments, indicating a low technique difficulty primarily. However, user comments mention aasans and challenges over 30 days, suggesting some elements may require more experience, slightly raising the score for Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video's 15-minute duration and focus on stretching imply a light-to-moderate effort level. Comments like 'body gets refreshed' but also 'body sweat like never before' suggest a slightly more demanding effort than typical light workouts, warranting a moderate score as well. This yoga session can serve both as a gentle introduction and slightly taxing depending on individual fitness levels.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The beginner tag and content accessible to those starting with yoga align with the primary fitness level recommendation. Some users experiencing challenges initially, as noted in comments, suggest that while beginners can attempt this, having some prior exposure to basic yoga could enhance experience and efficacy, thus intermediate is also suitable. The technique and effort scores do not demand advanced levels, supporting broader accessibility."
