  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled \"Breathing Routine To Help Fall Asleep I 1 Minute Breath Holds\" belongs most strongly to \"The Deep Recharge\" vibe, as the primary focus is on deep relaxation and nervous system reset to aid sleep. This is supported by tags like \"relaxation breathing for sleep\" and the description mentioning \"deep state of relaxation and bliss.\" The score of 0.9 reflects the strong alignment with these elements.\n\nIt also fits \"The Sleep Prep\" due to its design to help viewers fall asleep, indicated by repeated references to sleep-related benefits in the title, description, and tags such as \"sleeping breathing exercise\" and \"fall asleep meditation.\" The score of 0.8 suggests a strong but slightly less dominant fit compared to \"The Deep Recharge.\"\n\nLastly, \"The Zen Flow\" is a secondary match, characterized by the breath-centered, intentional nature of the practice. The rhythmic music infusion and gradual progression into relaxation support this vibe, earning a score of 0.6. While not the primary focus, elements of \"The Zen Flow\" are present, indicated by tags like \"pranayama breathing\" and comments expressing appreciation for the meditative nature of the session. Overall confidence in these classifications is high, given the explicit intentions outlined in the metadata."
