  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises mentioned involve using a birth ball for stretches and movements, which are typically very simple and do not require significant coordination or stability control. The exercises are designed to be accessible for pregnant women in their third trimester, and the main movements are likely to be gentle rocking, bouncing, or seated exercises on the ball, which do not involve complex techniques. This aligns with beginner-level technique difficulty.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is specifically designed for pregnant individuals to prepare for delivery, suggesting a primary audience that might be less fit at this stage. The beginner technique difficulty and light effort required make it particularly accessible. However, considering modifications and consistencies in physical activity during pregnancy, intermediate level is also included to recognize some users may have a baseline fitness or be further along in a pregnancy exercise regime. The content targets this specific context without high demands on prior fitness experience."
