  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video, titled 'Day 28 - 30 MIN Stretch, Relax & Recover Workout - Mobility, No Equipment, No Repeat', explicitly states in both the title and description that no equipment is required. The tags further reinforce the focus on stretching and mobility exercises, which often do not require equipment. Additionally, a top comment mentions 'no props,' indicating that viewers have noted the absence of equipment in performing the exercises. Therefore, with a high confidence level, it is concluded that the workout is designed to be a bodyweight-only routine without the need for any additional equipment."
