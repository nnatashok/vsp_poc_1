  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video metadata clearly indicates that this workout requires no equipment. The title itself, '30-Minute Full Body Bodyweight Workout (No Equipment Strength),' explicitly states that no equipment is needed and the focus is on bodyweight exercises. The description repeats this point several times, such as mentioning 'Build total body strength anywhere with this 30-Minute Bodyweight Workout' and 'EQUIPMENT: None, just your bodyweight!' Additionally, tags such as 'no equipment workout,' 'no equipment full body workout,' and 'full body workout no equipment' further emphasize that this workout is designed to be performed without any equipment. There is a mention of a yoga mat, but it refers to a personal preference for comfort rather than a requirement for the workout. All circuits and exercises listed are typical bodyweight movements that do not require additional equipment."
