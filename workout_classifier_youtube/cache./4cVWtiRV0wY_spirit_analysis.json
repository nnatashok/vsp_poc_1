  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit classification for this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 0.9. This is strongly indicated by the metadata, particularly the title and description, which emphasize relieving 'INTERCOSTAL MUSCLE PAIN' and providing a 'guided routine for managing symptoms & pain'. The presence of terms like 'helping', 'guided routine', and 'relief' underscores the restorative and recovery-focused nature of the workout. User comments support this classification, with multiple viewers expressing relief from pain after following the routine.\n\nA secondary spirit assigned is 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.6. This is due to the methodical approach taken in the routine, as described in the video metadata. The video features a series of exercises explained in detail by Louise, suggesting a disciplined, step-by-step instructional style. This inference is supported by comments suggesting a noticeable improvement in strength and mobility after following the routine consistently.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Flow & Rhythm' were not selected as the content is focused on slow, deliberate movements aimed at pain reduction rather than intensity or fluid motion."
