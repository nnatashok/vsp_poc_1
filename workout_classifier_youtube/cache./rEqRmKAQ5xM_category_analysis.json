  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is distinctly classified as 'Indoor biking' due to the repeated emphasis on 'stationary bike,' 'spin class,' 'indoor cycling,' and 'exercise bike' in the metadata, including the title, description, and tags. The presence of terms such as 'spin bike' and 'cycling' are strong indicators of indoor biking activities. The description directly addresses beginners using stationary bikes or exercise bikes, further affirming this categorization with high confidence. Since the entire workout takes place on a stationary bike, no other categories are relevant. Thus, the 'Indoor biking' category is assigned the highest score of 1, denoting its central and exclusive defining characteristic of the workout."
