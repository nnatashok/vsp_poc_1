  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled '10 MIN PERFECT ABS WORKOUT (NO EQUIPMENT BODYWEIGHT WORKOUT!)' explicitly states in its title that no equipment is needed, emphasizing it is a bodyweight workout. The phrase 'NO EQUIPMENT BODYWEIGHT WORKOUT!' directly indicates that no gym equipment is required for the exercises performed in the video. Additionally, the description and comments do not mention any necessary equipment, further supporting the claim that the workout is entirely bodyweight-focused. Therefore, the confidence level for requiring any equipment is at zero, suggesting the workout is designed to be performed without any additional tools or props."
