    "A fresh stretch routine for you guys! \u2764\ufe0f Stretching is so important for overall body health. Find time in your day to get a quick stretch on... I promise your body will thank you. Xx - Maddie",
    "LOVE your short full body stretch. I&#39;ve tried the 15 mins &amp; 5 min ones. Now trying this 12 min stretch. Also, I find it really helpful when you narrate the movement. Like when you move to the other side or change position. So I don&#39;t have to look a the video as much and can focus on the movement.",
    "To anyone who&#39;s reading this:<br>You are strong. You are beautiful. You are powerful. <br>Remind yourself that working out is not a punishment for what you ate, but a celebration of what your body can do!<br>I hope you have a fantastic day :))",
    "I just did this stretching routine as my afternoon study break and I feel soooo much better and energized for another round! Thank you Maddie, you\u2019re amazing \u2764\ufe0f",
    "Love that your dog joined you. My dogs always try and take over my mat when I&#39;m working out or stretching."
