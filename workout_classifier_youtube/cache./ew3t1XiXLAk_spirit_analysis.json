  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is primarily classified as \"Soothing & Restorative\" with high confidence (0.9). This is evidenced by the title and description, which emphasize terms like \"relax,\" \"ease,\u201d \u201creduce muscle tension,\" \"relieving stress,\" and \"relaxation.\" The focus on gentle, safe stretching for neck and shoulder tension aligns perfectly with a restorative spirit. Comments further support this, highlighting the calming voice, relaxing effects, and therapeutic relief users experience.\n\nA secondary spirit is \"Flow & Rhythm\" with moderate confidence (0.5), inferred from the guided series of exercises and the use of music in the background. However, music isn't the central focus, hence the moderate scoring.\n\nAdditionally, \"Structured & Disciplined\" receives a moderate score (0.5) due to the guided, step-by-step approach mentioned in the description and the routine's progression through various static and dynamic stretches. This step-by-step protocol suggests an organized method typical of structured sessions. Other spirits like High-Energy & Intense and Sport & Agility are not applicable due to the workout's gentle and restorative nature."
