  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified as a 'Yoga' workout due to multiple strong indicators across its metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'Morning Yoga' and aims to 'Energize and Remove Sleepiness.' The description reinforces this by describing it as a 'short 5 minute movement yoga class,' which clearly aligns with a yoga category. Additionally, the tags include 'vinyasa yoga,' 'full body yoga,' and 'yoga flow,' which are direct references to yoga practices. The channel, Breathe and Flow, is dedicated to yoga and lifestyle content, with mentions of high-level yoga certifications and yoga-focused retreats and classes. Comments further corroborate the impact and focus on yoga practices, highlighting flexibility, softness, and mental well-being benefits typical of yoga. The presence of vinyasa flow in tags and description suggests a dynamic style, but supports the overall yoga categorization, making it the defining element of the workout."
