  "categoriesExplanation": "The video 'Full Body Total Beginner Workout' from the channel 'growwithjo' is classified under 'Mat' and 'Body weight' categories. The choice of 'Mat' is based on the description and tags indicating a no-equipment structure, suggesting that exercises are performed on the ground using body movements. Terms such as 'all standing workouts', 'low impact', and 'easy to follow moves' confirm light cardio and mat-based exercises. 'Body weight' is relevant as the description emphasizes 'no equipment', a marker for workouts relying on the body's resistance. Tags like 'bodyweight workout' and 'beginner workout' further support this, indicating exercises like squats, lunges, and core work without external weights. The comments highlight the workout's suitability for absolute beginners and focus on foundational exercises, aligning with full body, low-intensity movements typical of bodyweight training. The scores reflect high confidence in these categories, as the metadata collectively emphasizes the workout's accessibility for newcomers without needing gym equipment."
