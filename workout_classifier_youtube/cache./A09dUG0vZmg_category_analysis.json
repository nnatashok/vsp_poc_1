  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is distinctly categorized as 'Pilates' with high confidence (score: 0.95). This classification is supported by the title mentioning 'FULL BODY PILATES WORKOUT' and 'mat pilates', the channel's focus on Pilates ('RA Pilates'), and the consistent emphasis on Pilates in both the description and tags. The tag 'pilates' confirms this focus, and the comments also reinforce the nature of the workout being true Pilates, as noted by a user appreciating its authenticity.\n\nAdditionally, the workout is associated with the 'Mat' category with moderate confidence (score: 0.6), as indicated by the terms 'mat pilates' and 'no equipment needed, just a Pilates mat or soft surface' mentioned in the description. This suggests the exercises are performed on a mat without other equipment, aligning with the characteristics of mat workouts.\n\nOther categories like 'Body weight' and 'Calisthenics' were considered but excluded due to the stronger specific emphasis on Pilates rather than general bodyweight exercises or gymnastic movements."
