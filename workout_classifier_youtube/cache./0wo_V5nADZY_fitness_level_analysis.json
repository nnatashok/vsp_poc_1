  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves a combination of exercises utilizing dumbbells, classified as HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training), which generally requires a moderate level of coordination, balance, and control when incorporating weights. The title suggests the workout focuses on 'full body' engagement, implying a range of compound exercises like squats, lunges, or shoulder presses, which are typically intermediate in complexity. There is no mention of highly technical movements that would elevate the difficulty to an advanced level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 34:55 long, which contributes to a higher effort difficulty, especially for less fit users. The use of dumbbells in a HIIT routine suggests significant energy expenditure and cardiovascular demand. The combination of a 30-minute duration, the inclusion of weights, likely without prolonged rest periods (typical for HIIT formats), indicates a challenging effort level. The description tags emphasize fat loss, typically associated with high-effort routines.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulty assessments, this workout is primarily aimed at an intermediate fitness level. However, users can modulate intensity through weight choice and exercise modification, allowing involvement of more experienced beginners. Despite the intermediate technique difficulty, the challenging effort difficulty means only motivated beginners or those progressing from a foundational program would find it manageable. Advanced users could potentially find this routine suitable with heavier weights or higher intensity to maintain effort challenge. Hence, multiple fitness levels are classified: Beginner (for very motivated or progressing beginners), Intermediate (main target), and Advanced (possible with adjustments)."
