  "vibesExplanation": "The selected workout video is a strength-focused session designed for a full-body workout using bodyweight exercises, indicated by tags such as 'bodyweight strength workout', 'no equipment strength training', and 'full body strength workout'. The inclusion of 'active movements and isometric holds' suggests a demanding and muscle-engaging routine, which aligns with 'The Warrior Workout' vibe, scoring 0.7 due to the focus on primal energy and sweat-dripping exercise as noted in comments about being drenched in sweat.\n\nThe 'Endorphin Wave' vibe also fits, scoring 0.6, supported by the uplifting user testimonials about feeling motivated and happy post-workout. The progressive nature of the workout with timers and modifications supports a steady constructive energy.\n\nLastly, 'The Masterclass Workout' is somewhat applicable, scoring 0.5 due to the instructional elements noted in comments (e.g., 'how-tos while you\u2019re resting', format appreciation), pointing towards a technique-focused class.\n\nWhile 'The Firestarter' and 'The Groove Session' were considered, they were excluded because the workout lacks high-intensity bursts and dance-like elements, respectively."
