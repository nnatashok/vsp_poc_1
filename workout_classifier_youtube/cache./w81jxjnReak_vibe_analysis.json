  "vibesExplanation": "The video is strongly identified with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe due to its emphasis on gentle, restorative breathwork aimed at lymphatic cleansing, which aligns with nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement. The description mentions enhancing the body's natural cleansing and detoxification, consistent with the vibe's characteristics. The breathing pattern (4s inhale, 16s hold, 8s exhale) cultivates a calming, mindful experience, suggesting significant alignment with this vibe (score 0.9).\n\nAdditionally, 'The Reboot Workout' is relevant as the exercise promotes a bodily refresh through the lymphatic system, offering a low-stress yet revitalizing effect, thus scoring 0.7. The calming nature of breathwork and the stated benefits (eliminating stress, boosting energy) bears elements of a total-body refresh, supporting this secondary vibe.\n\nThe absence of intense physical strain or competition excludes vigorous or energetic vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.' The focus on breath over physical exertion further distances it from high-intensity vibes."
