  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized primarily as 'Meditation' due to explicit mention in both the title ('10-Minute Meditation For Sleep') and description of being a guided meditation aimed at aiding sleep. The tags heavily support this, featuring terms like 'guided meditation for sleep', 'meditation for sleep', and generally associating with sleep and meditation. This strong focus on meditation activities justifies a category score of 1.0. There is also a possible secondary connection to 'Breathing exercises', suggested by the focus on easing the mind and body, a common element in breathing techniques, but this is less explicitly supported, meriting a score of 0.5. Other categories, such as 'Yoga' or 'Stretching', are not relevant due to the absence of physical movement or postures in the metadata, and 'Other' isn't applicable given the specificity of details available."
