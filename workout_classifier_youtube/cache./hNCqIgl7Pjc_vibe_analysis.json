  "vibesExplanation": "The video's primary vibe is identified as 'The Reboot Workout' (score 0.8) due to its focus on gentle, total-body stretching intended for stress relief and muscle recovery, as indicated by terms like \" stress relief & recovery\" and \"post workout stretch\" in the title and description. The mention of deep breathing and relaxation techniques further supports this classification. 'The Zen Flow' (score 0.7) is also suitable due to the structured, breath-centered approach to stretching described in the metadata, with tips emphasizing mindful breath control and connection with the body. Additionally, user comments highlight the relaxing nature of the workout, aligning with 'The Zen Flow.' Lastly, 'The Comfort Moves' (score 0.4) is a potential vibe, evident from user comments pointing out the routine's ability to relieve stress and ease into the day. However, its focus on active muscle engagement and stress relief slightly differentiates it from purely comfort-based sessions, warranting a lower confidence score for this vibe."
