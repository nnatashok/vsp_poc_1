  "vibesExplanation": "The video is titled '15 MIN FULL BODY STRETCH - For Rest Day, Improve Mobility & Flexibility, Follow Along Style' and emphasizes recovery and mobility, suited for rest days, indicating a strong match with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, evidenced by terms like 'Stretch and recover', 'recharge', and 'rest day'. Scoring 0.9 for this vibe reflects the high relevance to the workout\u2019s restorative focus. The description encourages a gentle, flow-based approach without equipment, aligning with 'The Zen Flow'\u2014noted in 'recharge our bodies and mind' and 'make this your own workout'. This vibe scores 0.75 due to the emphasis on breath-centered, unhurried movement seen in stretches like 'pigeon pose' and 'downward dog'. Channel theme and user comments reinforce this, mentioning flexibility improvements and calming effects, further supporting a restorative, mindful experience. Other vibes such as 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Deep Recharge' weren't selected, as they imply longer, endurance-centric or ultra-gentle sessions not fully representative of this video."
