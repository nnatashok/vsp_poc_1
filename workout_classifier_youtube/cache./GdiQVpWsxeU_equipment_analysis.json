  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Feel Better In 8 Minutes | Morning Breathwork Routine' appears to require no physical equipment. The focus is on breathwork and mindfulness, as indicated by the tags like 'breathwork,' 'mindfulness,' and 'meditation,' and phrases in the description such as 'breathing exercises' and '8 minute breathwork routine.' There is no mention of physical exercise equipment in the title, description, or tags. The description emphasizes the mental and emotional benefits of the practice, suggesting it is a guided session likely done in a seated or comfortable position without the need for equipment typical in physical workouts. Comments from users also reinforce the nature of the video focusing on breath and personal experiences rather than physical activity requiring equipment. Therefore, the workout is effectively a bodyweight-only session focused on breathing."
