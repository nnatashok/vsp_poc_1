    "I&#39;ve been doing your reformer workouts exclusively for a year now and really love your style, pace &amp; instruction. You deliver a challenging workout without loud music and yelling! Thanks for adding the mic, we can hear you better now. If you have a Patreon I&#39;d be happy to support all the effort you put in to these videos.",
