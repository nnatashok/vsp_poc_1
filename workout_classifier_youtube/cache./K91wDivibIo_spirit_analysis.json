  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit assigned to this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence score of 0.9. The video's title, 'Pilates for Better Sleep Workout,' clearly indicates a focus on improving sleep through gentle movement, which aligns with relaxation and stress reduction. The description further emphasizes reducing stress and winding down before sleep, supporting a restorative nature. Tags like 'bedtime pilates yoga,' 'relaxing pilates workout,' and comments expressing gratitude for the calming effects reinforce this classification.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' scoring 0.5. While the primary aim is relaxation, phrases such as 'balance of movement and stretching' and references to 'evening pilates stretch' suggest a rhythmical element to the workout, contributing to a mind-body connection typical of flowing movements, albeit with a lesser emphasis than its soothing qualities. This dual focus is typical in classes that aim to relax while maintaining a subtle element of movement."
