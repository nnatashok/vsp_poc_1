  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title and tags repeatedly mention 'dumbbell,' emphasizing that this piece of equipment is central to the workout, making it very high confidence (0.9). Specifically, it is described as a 'full body dumbbell workout' and 'dumbbell strength,' indicating that dumbbells are integral to the exercises performed. The description further corroborates this by recommending that participants use slightly heavier dumbbells than they might normally. Hence, dumbbells are explicitly required for this workout, and there is no ambiguity or mention of other equipment, leading to the conclusion that dumbbells are the only necessary equipment item."
