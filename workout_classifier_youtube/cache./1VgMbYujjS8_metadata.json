    "I had tears on my face at the end of this meditation. I feel great and free, thank you. A new me",
    "I can&#39;t stop the tears streaming down my cheeks and onto my shirt. It seems too good to be true right this minute, but I believe that as I continue on my journey, and remind myself of the changes I can make by listening to these and others in your amazing set of meditations, I can begin to start writing in my new book. I don&#39;t even have the words to thank you and your group for sharing these meditations. Thank you. \ud83d\udc9c",
    "Crying like crazy over here \ud83d\ude22 ...this pandemic stripped me of my Colorado dreams I worked incredibly hard to achieve and sent me back home to the 1 place I dont want to be. This reminds me of hiking in the Rocky Mountains and even though I am crying, this meditation is so powerful and it makes me feel good knowing this is all temporary and things will be ok eventually and it&#39;s ok to let go of the burdens we carry that we have no control over, such as this worldy situation. Thank you so much for creating it. Its my absolute favorite meditation now. Stay safe \ud83d\udc9a",
    "This mediation made me cry happy tears. Makes me excited for my new journey I am about to embark on. This was a perfect meditation for me to really feel and visualize my future. Thank you so much!"
