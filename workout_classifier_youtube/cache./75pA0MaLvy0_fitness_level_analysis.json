  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 15 minutes long, focusing on stretching and flexibility, which typically involves low energy expenditure and physical intensity. Descriptions such as 'gentle enough to do every day' and 'focuses on breathing' suggest a light effort level. User comments also support this, with language like 'gentle movements' and 'frustration free' indicating minimal to moderate exertion levels. Due to the possibility of some moderate effort in maintaining stretches or postural focus, a small score is allocated to 'Moderate' effort difficulty.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is explicitly stated as suitable for beginners, and the content focuses on gentle stretches to improve flexibility and movement. The technique and effort difficulties align strongly with a 'Beginner' classification as commenters felt encouraged and capable, yet an intermediate score is slightly acknowledged due to individual adjustments in intensity or existing skills in flexibility. The language in the description and comments reflects content accessible to those new to exercise, reinforcing the 'Beginner' fitness level classification with a slight consideration for returning or slightly more experienced individuals at an 'Intermediate' level."
