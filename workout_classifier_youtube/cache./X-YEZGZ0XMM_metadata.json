    "Because of Caroline&#39;s workouts I&#39;ve gone from struggling to do half a push up to doing decline pushups, wide push ups etc. I&#39;m so happy!!!",
    "What in the world just happened to me?? Arms totally gave out in those diver pushups.  And now I&#39;m supposed to DIAMOND pushups?? I&#39;m laughing that&#39;s so funny! What&#39;s even more funny is that I keep doing these workouts and LOVE them!! \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udcaa",
    "Caroline has included some important exercise in this workout that should be done by everyone on a weekly basis. Like REAR DELTS RAISES, REVERSE SNOW ANGELS and SCAPULAR PUSH-UPS for the health of your upper back.  Also everything in the finisher.  Fantastic workout.",
    "This must be the best bodyweight upper body workout on YouTube. I&#39;ve been doing it the past 5 months and I&#39;ve gotten so much stronger. It gets easier everytime."
