  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is labeled as a 'Beginner to Moderate Pilates' class, suggesting it targets users with basic to intermediate Pilates knowledge. The absence of equipment simplifies the routine, making it accessible for beginners. However, Pilates often involves core engagement and specific breathing techniques, which require some coordination, justifying the presence of intermediate complexity. User comments suggest common challenges such as reversing movements, which require attention to form, indicating a mixed level of technique demand.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "At 24 minutes, this workout is slightly longer than stated in the title, suggesting it requires more stamina than very short sessions. Described as an 'Express Pilates' workout, it is designed to be quick and efficient, which usually implies low to moderate effort, aligning with the 'Beginner to Moderate' label. Comments mentioning that '20 minutes could be so painful' indicate perceived effort, though this might emanate from less conditioned users, suggesting moderate effort for them. Furthermore, Pilates generally has a low to moderate intensity, without the high energy expenditure of cardio workouts.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the 'Beginner to Moderate' classification and the workout length of 24 minutes, the required fitness level spans from beginner to intermediate. Pilates itself caters to a wide range of abilities, allowing for modifications to increase or decrease intensity and technique difficulty. The presence of users in the comments documenting their early progress suggests accessibility for beginners, but the workout duration and certain movements imply that absolute beginners may find it moderately challenging, justifying the intermediate inclusion."
