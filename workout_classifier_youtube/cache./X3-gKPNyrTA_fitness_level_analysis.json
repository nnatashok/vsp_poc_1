  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The movements in this yoga video are focused on the neck, shoulders, and upper back, intended to relieve tension and improve posture. Keywords like 'therapeutic sequence,' 'reduce inflammation,' and 'increase the range of motion' suggest that the exercises are gentle and restorative. The use of these terms, along with the tagging of 'beginner yoga' and 'yoga for beginners', strongly indicates that the technique difficulty is primarily beginner level, with some possibility of intermediate due to the focus on specific body areas that may require slight body awareness.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is 10 minutes long, focusing on stretching and relieving discomfort in the upper body areas. This type of exercise typically involves minimal energy expenditure, classified as 'Light'. The comments and description emphasize relieving tension rather than exerting high effort. The slight inclusion of 'Moderate' is due to the specific targeting of stress and tension areas, which may offer a slight challenge in terms of mobility work.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the beginner-level technique difficulty and light effort required, this video is most appropriate for beginners, as confirmed by the tags and description. There is a slight inclusion of intermediate due to possible adjustments required for targeted muscle relief and mobility enhancement, requiring a bit more than absolute beginner body awareness. Comments from users new to yoga affirm the suitability for someone starting their fitness journey, but the description and use of terms like 'therapeutic sequence' suggest even those with some yoga experience could find value, thus slightly extending into the intermediate level."
