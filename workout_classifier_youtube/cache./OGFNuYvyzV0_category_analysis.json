  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Yoga', with a score of 0.9, as indicated by the title, tags (such as 'yoga for vertigo', '15 minute yoga practice'), and description, which all emphasize yoga. The channel, 'Yoga With Adriene', is also focused on yoga practices, lending strong support to this classification.\n\nA secondary category is 'Breathing exercises', with a score of 0.5, due to the mention of 'breath work, or pranayama' in the description, suggesting that controlled breathing is a significant part of the workout. This is an implicit but substantial element of the session.\n\nWhile the video is designed for vertigo, it remains firmly within the context of yoga practices, excluding categories like 'Stretching' or 'Meditation' that might initially seem related but do not have strong enough coverage or mention. The comments reinforce the supportive, community-based atmosphere typical of yoga practices, confirming the primary categorization."
