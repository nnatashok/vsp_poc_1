    "I crushed it! 16 weeks pregnant and this is my first workout since getting pregnant, first trimester was really tough but this made me feel amazing! Can\u2019t wait to do it again \ud83d\ude0a",
    "I&#39;m 22 weeks now and feels so good to do an exercise that makes me perspire again! Thanks!",
    "\ud83c\udf89 My first workout since week 8 of pregnancy! I\u2019m 15.5 weeks and first trimester left me sick and exhausted. It\u2019s so nice to feel like I did some meaningful activity today!",
    "I started this particular workout from my 6th month (since I failed my gtt ) and started losing weight since then ..now I&#39;m in my 8th month and hasn&#39;t gained any since then (hopefully that normal) although doc said my baby is growing healthy..Alhamdulilah <br>This exercise definitely helped me alot with leg swelling and flexibility  <br>\u2764\u2764\u2764",
    "I crushed it !<br>28 weeks at 2 days today . And before pregnancy I worked out regularly I\u2019ve been out the gym a few months and this is just what I needed just enough to push me but not over doing it. Worked me out well, paused the video between to give myself a little extra time to take a few extra more minutes to break and Ofcourse run to restroom . Lol .<br><br>Thank you \u2764"
