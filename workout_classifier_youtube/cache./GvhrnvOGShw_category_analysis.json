  "categoriesExplanation": "The metadata strongly supports the classification of this workout as an 'Elliptical' exercise. The video title, 'Ultimate 20 Minute Elliptical Workout,' clearly indicates the primary focus on using an elliptical machine. The description adds that ellipticals are used for 'intense, low impact, calorie burning, cardio workout.' Tags such as 'elliptical workout,' '20-minute elliptical workout at home,' and 'elliptical machine workout' further reinforce this classification. Additionally, the structured workout details described, including various 'Speed Block,' 'Resistance Block,' and 'Max Effort Block,' are all designed specifically for an elliptical machine, making its presence extremely strong as the central defining aspect of this workout video. There is no ambiguity or overlap with other workout categories."
