  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Stretching' with a score of 1.0. This is supported by the video title 'Full Body Stretch Routine' indicating a focus on stretching exercises. The description further reinforces this with phrases like 'full body stretch routine' and 'great for flexibility and mobility', and comments mention viewers using the video for stretching and improving flexibility. No equipment is needed, aligning perfectly with typical stretching routines.\n\nAn 'Other' category is considered with a low score of 0.19 due to the absence of direct evidence pointing to any additional workout types present in the metadata. This score reflects a very slight presence or relevance given the lack of distinguishing factors for other categories mentioned."
