  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "This workout video is clearly centered around indoor cycling, as indicated by the title \"15 Minute HIIT CARDIO INDOOR CYCLING WORKOUT\" and numerous references in the description and tags such as \"cycling workout,\" \"spin class,\" \"spin workout,\" and \"indoor cycling workout.\" The channel is also dedicated to cycling, as evidenced by its name 'Kaleigh Cohen Cycling.' The description explicitly mentions getting 'on your bike' for the workout. All these factors contribute to a very high confidence level of 0.95 that an exercise bike is essential for this workout."
