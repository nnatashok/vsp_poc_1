  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled \"15 Minute Full Body Calisthenics Workout for Beginners\" and the metadata repeatedly emphasizes \"calisthenics\" and \"bodyweight training.\" Tags such as \"calisthenics,\" \"beginner calisthenics,\" \"bodyweight workout,\" and \"no equipment workout\" indicate that the exercises are primarily performed using the body alone, without additional equipment. The description further supports this, stating the workout requires \"minimal equipment\" and highlighting \"bodyweight training\" and \"calisthenics exercises.\" Additionally, the channel's focus is on calisthenics, which is usually characterized by exercises performed without external weights. Comments reinforce the notion that the workout is accessible and effective without equipment. Given these insights, the confidence is very high that this workout is exclusively bodyweight-based, and therefore, no equipment is required."
