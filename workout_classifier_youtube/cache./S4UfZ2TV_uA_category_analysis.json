  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized primarily as 'Stretching' with high confidence, as the description emphasizes 'incorporating stretching to help relieve tension in the lower belly & back,' and tags such as 'pms stretch,' 'period stretch,' and 'relieve period cramps' further support this. 'Yoga' is also a relevant category, supported by tags like 'yoga for period cramps' and 'yoga for period,' indicating elements of yoga are included to assist with period discomfort, leading to a score of 0.6 due to this supporting evidence. The 'Mat' category is applicable because the workout is performed without equipment, likely on the floor, as indicated by the 'mat' mention and low intensity, which aligns with non-equipment mat exercises; this is given a 0.6 score. Other categories like 'HIIT' or 'Weight workout' are excluded due to the workout's explicit focus on low intensity and stretching rather than high intensity or weight-based activities. The overall classification confidence is high at 0.9 due to the clear purpose of the workout and strong supporting metadata."
