  "vibesExplanation": "The video presents an 'Express Power Pilates Workout' designed to be fast-paced and efficient, suggesting a focus on technique and mastery of Pilates movements, making it a strong match for 'The Masterclass Workout' with a score of 0.7. The use of 'power' and 'express' implies a slightly more intense session than traditional Pilates, demanding dedication and discipline, which aligns with 'The Disciplined Grind' vibe, earning a score of 0.6. The channel's ethos of 'movement that feels good for your body and soul' and the creator's background in yoga suggest an underlying mindfulness and intentional movement, characteristic of 'The Zen Flow,' albeit to a lesser extent at 0.5. Comments about energy, feeling good, and exercise discipline back these interpretations, giving a high confidence level of 0.75 in the classification."
