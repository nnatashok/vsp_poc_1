The metadata suggests the video is a '15-Minute Morning Yoga Full Body Stretch', indicating a grounding and breath-centered practice typical of The Zen Flow. The description and tags emphasize a daily yoga routine aimed at beginners and morning practice, which aligns with slow-flow, intentional movement. Additionally, the Satvic Movement's focus on health, spirituality, and well-being supports this vibe.\n\nThe secondary vibe identified is 'The Reboot Workout', with a moderate score of 0.6. The workout's brief duration and emphasis on full-body stretch suggest a refreshing and low-stress session, which are characteristics of a reboot-style workout. Viewer comments describe the routine as refreshing and energizing, further supporting this classification.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Groove Session' were considered but excluded due to the lack of emphasis on fun and expressive elements typically associated with dance-based workouts.
