  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is categorized primarily under 'Mat' with a score of 0.8 due to the repeated emphasis on 'no equipment' and 'apartment & small space friendly' in the title, tags, and description. These elements suggest the exercises are performed on an exercise mat or in a manner suitable for a small indoor area. The mention of 'no jumping' further aligns with mat-based low-impact cardio or strength exercises without equipment. \n\nFurthermore, 'Body weight' is assigned a score of 0.7 since the workout focuses on a full-body routine using no equipment, implying reliance on bodyweight exercises. User comments indicating intense effort and muscle shaking suggest strength-oriented movements consistent with bodyweight training.\n\nOther categories such as 'HIIT', 'Calisthenics', or 'Weight workout' were excluded due to the lack of structured intervals, gymnastic movements, or equipment-based resistance training mentioned in the metadata. Overall, high confidence is attributed to the categories due to explicit markers in the video information and supportive user feedback."
