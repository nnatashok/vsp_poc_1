    "Thank you so much for this new treadmill workout.  As mentioned in a previous video comment section of a video you did 2 years ago on the workout for beginner treadmill  I started my journey in March 2022.  Following that video I have lost 35 pounds by simply adjusting speeds.  I am going to add this one now to my regular routine, thanks again.",
