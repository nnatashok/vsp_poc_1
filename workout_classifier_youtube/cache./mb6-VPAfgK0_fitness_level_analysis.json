  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is primarily 'Beginner' as the 4-7-8 breathing exercise involves very simple and basic breathing patterns that require minimal coordination and no advanced skills. It's designed for relaxation, not physical exertion. The minor 'Intermediate' aspect comes from the controlled breathing technique that may take some practice to sync correctly, particularly for those unaccustomed to focused breathing techniques.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner' due to the simple nature of the breathing exercises, which require no prior fitness experience. This is indicated by the channel's focus on 'easiest guided meditations' and the calming nature explicitly stated in the description. A minor 'Intermediate' score is included for those who might find deep breathing initially demanding or need to practice holding breaths longer, as hinted by potential lightheadedness. However, overall, the exercise accommodates all fitness levels easily due to its non-physically demanding nature and self-paced customization."
