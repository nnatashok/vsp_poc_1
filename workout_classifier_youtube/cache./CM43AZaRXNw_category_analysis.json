  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Yoga' with a score of 1.0, evidenced by the explicit focus on yoga throughout the metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'Yoga Workout' and various tags include 'yoga flow', 'vinyasa yoga', and 'morning yoga', indicating a strong emphasis on yoga practice. The channel, 'Yoga with Kassandra', specializes in producing yoga content, further supporting this classification.\n\nThe 'Stretching' category is given a score of 0.6 as the video includes \"stretchy poses\" according to the description, and tags like 'full body stretch' suggest components of flexibility training, which aligns with stretching practices. The video's classification as a full-body flow also implies stretching is an integral but secondary component, hence the moderate score.\n\nNo other categories were considered due to the clear focus on yoga, with specific mention of energy-boosting and strength-building yoga flows, excluding more general fitness or other specific exercise types."
