  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'moderate level' and 'Classical Pilates inspired,' suggesting a focus on controlled techniques common in Pilates. Pilates typically involves precise movements but remains accessible at foundational levels when performed correctly. Thus, the combination of a mat pilates format and a moderate descriptor implies simplicity suitable for beginners but may also interest intermediate participants, especially as it requires body awareness typical of Pilates routines.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 38:42 minutes and a 'moderate level' description, the workout likely requires sustained effort suitable for moderate energy expenditure. The continuous nature of pilates with focus on core strength could push it slightly into the 'challenging' category for less-fit individuals, even without high-intensity motions. The lack of equipment suggests a reliance on bodyweight endurance, which can be moderately strenuous over an extended period.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The combination of controlled, classical Pilates methods with a moderate intensity level over 38 minutes is accessible to beginners, assuming they can follow along with variations or take breaks as needed. Because of the reliance on core stabilization and prolonged engagement, the workout aligns well with intermediate practitioners seeking to deepen practice, while also offering a reasonable challenge for advanced users due to the precision and endurance required. Pilates allows modification in technique, broadening suitability across several fitness levels."
