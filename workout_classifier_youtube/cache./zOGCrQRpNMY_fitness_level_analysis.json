  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is characterized as a lower body stretch for muscle recovery and stress relief, targeting common areas such as legs and lower body that require minimal technical skills. Keywords like 'stretching at home,' 'muscle recovery,' and 'stretching for beginners' suggest the exercises are simple and straightforward, aligning with beginner-level technique difficulty. Comments about the video indicate it features basic, accessible stretches with music, further supporting a beginner classification. The mention of 'easy-to-follow' and 'low impact modifications' in the channel description implies a simplicity that caters to a broad audience, possibly extending to less complex intermediate-level flexibility exercises, justifying a minimal intermediate score.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The metadata strongly indicates a light effort difficulty. The video is a short, 7-minute stretch routine intended for muscle recovery and stress relief, as denoted by phrases like 'lower body stretch,' 'muscle recovery,' and 'stress relief.' These terms generally correlate with gentle activity designed to recuperate rather than exert, which would naturally entail low energy expenditure. User comments reflect a relaxed experience that coincided with music, integrated breaks, and no intensity-focused statements, which supports a definite light effort classification. The availability of 'quick break in between moves' reinforces the light intensity, making it suitable for complete beginners.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Derived from the technique and effort difficulty, the video fits within the 'Beginner' fitness level solidly. This is because the exercises are simple stretches meant for recovery, which is particularly accessible to those new to fitness or seeking gentle movements. The 'Muscle Recovery' and 'Stretching for Beginners' keywords, alongside 'lower body stretches' and 'post workout stretch,' highlight its friendly nature for those unfamiliar with more strenuous workouts. The short duration and 'light' effort further affirm its suitability for beginners. Minimal elements of 'Intermediate' classification arise from descriptors in the metadata such as 'professional programming' and 'active recovery' that suggest increased coordination or understanding, which is marginally more demanding and justifies a mild intermediate score."
