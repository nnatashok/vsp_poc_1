  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The emphasis is on a gentle and feel-good pilates workout, suggesting simple movements, but wording like 'Pilates' usually involves some body awareness and form correction.

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is likely accessible to beginners due to the gentle nature and simplicity of a no-equipment pilates routine. Still, due to the need for bodily awareness typical of pilates and modest effort, it\u2019s also suitable for those who have practiced fitness sporadically, aligning with intermediate as well. Given the workout duration of 26:58 and the presence of moderate coordination demands, a significant share of intermediate-level recognition is assigned alongside beginners."
