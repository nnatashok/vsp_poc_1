  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is a yoga session focused on full body stretches for tension and sore muscles, as described in both the title and description. The practice of yoga generally requires a mat, particularly for stretches, to provide comfort and grip during floor exercises. The feedback from user comments also acknowledges the use of a mat, further confirming its necessity for this workout. Therefore, the confidence score for the mat is set very high at 0.9. There are no indications in the metadata of any other equipment being used or needed in this session, keeping the focus on body stretches using a mat."
