  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout spirit for this video is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a score of 1.0 due to multiple explicit indicators in the metadata. The title ('SLOW WORKOUT FOR PERIOD/PMS') and description emphasize the low intensity and low impact nature designed to relieve tension, specifically during menstruation. Phrases like 'relieve period cramps' and 'relieve tension in the lower belly & back' suggest a focus on healing and relaxation. The tags repeatedly mention period cramps, slow and low intensity workouts, highlighting the restorative aspect. \n\nAdditionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' scores a 0.5 as a secondary spirit. This is inferred from the mention of stretching and the smooth, gentle pacing implied by a 'slow workout', which hints at a degree of mind-body connection and continuous movement typical of this spirit. However, the primary focus is clearly on soothing and relieving tension. Other spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility', are clearly not relevant as the workout avoids jumping and high-intensity effort."
