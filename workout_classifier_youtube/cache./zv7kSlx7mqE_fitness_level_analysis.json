  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a Pilates-based deep core activation challenge, which often involves movements requiring awareness of body positioning and stabilization, typical of Pilates exercises. These factors imply an intermediate level of technique difficulty, as coordination and body awareness are needed. The description emphasizes core activation and hints at some complexity but does not indicate advanced technical skills are required, placing it reasonably in the intermediate category.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short, 8-minute Pilates session focused on core activation. While described as intense, the effort difficulty is moderated by its shorter duration. The feedback from users suggests a noticeable burn, which indicates a level of challenge, hence it could be sensed as challenging for some due to the focused muscular engagement. However, given the duration and typical Pilates intensity, it aligns more with a moderate level for general users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.75,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is claimed to be suitable for beginners by user comments, though others also acknowledge its intensity. Technique demands suggested intermediate familiarity with core engagement typical of Pilates. Given the relatively short duration and user reviews, beginners are likely to find it approachable, though somewhat challenging, hence both beginner and intermediate are appropriate required fitness levels, with a slight potential appeal for advanced users seeking focused core work. This inclusion of multiple fitness levels provides accessibility to a broad audience."
