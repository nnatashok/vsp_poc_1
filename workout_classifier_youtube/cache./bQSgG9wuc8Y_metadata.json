    "I LOVE this workout! Thank you for making a 40-minute, no-repeat, sweat-it-out routine. You keep it fun and entertaining with your quirky style and smart coaching. Happy New Year! Please keep doing more!",
    "What a great workout! My husband and I have recently started training 3-4 times a week with your videos and we&#39;re loving them \ud83d\ude0d We appreciate the work you put in to crafting these routines, along with your sense of humour and of course your super chilled dogs. Thank you so much \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97",
    "I am 3 months post partum and I have been trying to find motivation to get back into exercising for a mountain of reasons... I bought an exercise bike and THEN found your videos and I just want you to know your work outs are a TOTAL GAME CHANGER. You have such a joyful, funny, can-do attitude and it is contagious and it makes people WANT to come back. I didn&#39;t even bother looking for any other videos because you are IT. I can&#39;t tell you what a difference it has made to find your channel! Loved this Day 2 work out and I can&#39;t wait to come back for more tomorrow! Thank you, Kaleigh!!!",
    "I\u2019ve only recently found your channel and the workouts are great, not too complicated and definitely helping me get back in shape after being out of action for over a year. Love the stretching ones too."
