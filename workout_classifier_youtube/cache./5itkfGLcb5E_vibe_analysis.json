  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this video is 'The Sleep Prep' with a score of 0.9. This is based on explicit indicators in the title, 'Guided Meditation Before Sleep: Let Go of the Day,' and the numerous tags related to sleep and letting go, such as 'sleep meditation' and 'before bed meditation.' The video's primary focus is on preparing for rest, aligning closely with the 'Sleep Prep' vibe. \n\nAdditionally, 'The Deep Recharge' scored 0.7 since the meditation aims to 'let go of the day,' which is indicative of a nervous system reset through gentle, relaxing movement. The calming and supportive comments from viewers, such as gratitude for easing anxiety, further reinforce this vibe.\n\n'Zen Flow' received a score of 0.6 because the meditation is grounding, breath-centered, and unhurried, which are all elements of meditative and slow practices. The channel's focus on mindfulness and Scott's tone of support and empathy contribute to this classification.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Reboot Workout' were excluded as the content is distinctly geared toward relaxation and not physical mobility or stretching."
