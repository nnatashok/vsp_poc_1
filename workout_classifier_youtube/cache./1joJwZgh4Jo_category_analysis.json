  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized primarily as a HIIT workout due to the explicit mention of 'TABATA,' a form of high-intensity interval training, in both the title and description. The use of terms like 'INTENSE Fat Burning' and 'go all out' further supports this classification, resulting in a high confidence score of 0.9 for HIIT.\n\nAdditionally, the workout involves exercises targeting the 'Lower Abs & Booty,' suggesting the use of bodyweight exercises to achieve these goals. This aligns with the body weight category, which is assigned a moderate-high score of 0.7. The mention of a warm-up and specific tabata intervals implies floor exercises consistent with mat workouts, hence a moderate score of 0.6 for Mat. \n\nAlternative categories such as Weight workout or Indoor biking were excluded because there is no mention of weights or cycling equipment in the description or tags. The descriptions in the comments support a high intensity and body-focused workout, further affirming the chosen categories."
