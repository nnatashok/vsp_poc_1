  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Treadmill' with a high confidence score of 0.9, as indicated by the title \"20 Min Interval Walking Treadmill Workout for Beginners\" and the repeated mention of the treadmill machine throughout the tags, description, and workout details. The video clearly involves using a treadmill machine, focusing on walking routines. \n\nThe 'Walking' category is also highly relevant with a score of 0.8. The workout is specifically described as a walking routine, perfect for beginners who want to engage in a low-impact, consistent walking exercise on a treadmill. Evidence of structured walking intervals with different speeds ranging from 2.0 MPH to 4.0 MPH supports this classification.\n\nThe addition of 'HIIT' with a score of 0.6 is due to the intermittent nature of the exercise mentioned in the description and tags, such as 'interval walking,' which suggests elements of high-intensity interval training. This is corroborated by the structured changes in speed and intensity during the workout, effectively introducing shorter bursts of more intense activity followed by periods of lower intensity, which aligns with HIIT principles. While the workout is low-impact primarily due to the walking components, the interval structure cannot be overlooked."
