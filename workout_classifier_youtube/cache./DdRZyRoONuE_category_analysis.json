  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified into the 'Indoor biking' and 'HIIT' categories. The video title 'Rolling With The Hills | 45 Mins HIIT Indoor Cycling Workout' explicitly states that it is a cycling workout using indoor bikes and includes high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which aligns perfectly with both categories. The description supports this classification, discussing the simulation of race climbing scenarios and detailing the interval session with variable intensities, typical of HIIT workouts. The presence of terms like 'spin class', 'indoor cycling', and multiple intervals in the tags further affirms the classification. User comments discussing the use of spin bikes and specific cadence also corroborate with 'Indoor biking'. The high engagement and positive feedback indicate a strong association with both categories, hence a confidence level of 1.0. HIIT is marked at 0.9 due to its pivotal role in the workout's design, although the core activity centers around indoor cycling."
