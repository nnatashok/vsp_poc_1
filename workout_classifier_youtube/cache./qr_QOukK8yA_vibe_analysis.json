  "vibesExplanation": "The video is titled '60 Minute Indoor Cycling Workout | Endurance Ride,' and includes terms like 'Endurance Ride' and 'Long indoor cycling ride.' The focus on endurance and a 60-minute duration aligns well with 'The Meditative Grind,' which involves zoning in and letting repetition take over. The channel description and comments suggesting it's a staple workout they return to reinforces this, leading to a high confidence score of 0.8. \n\nThe description mentions 'two focussed blocks of intensity and a strong finish,' coupled with a playlist featuring upbeat music, supporting the assignment of 'The Endorphin Wave.' The consistent long duration and incremental energy build align with this vibe, justifying a 0.7 score.\n\nThe tags and playlist indicate a strong musical component, aligning with 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse.' This isn't expressed as strongly as the endurance elements, but the presence of music throughout the workout merits a moderate score of 0.5."
