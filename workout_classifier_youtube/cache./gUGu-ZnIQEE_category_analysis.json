  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is most accurately classified under the 'Pilates' category with a very high confidence score of 1.0. This is strongly supported by the title \"My BEST Pilates Lower Body Exercises | 15 min At Home Pilates Workout,\" explicitly indicating the Pilates nature of the workout. Additionally, the tags include phrases such as \"pilates workout,\" \"pilates exercises,\" \"pilates home workout,\" and \"lower body pilates,\" reinforcing that Pilates exercises form the core of the workout.\n\nFurthermore, the description mentions it as a \"15 minute at home pilates butt and leg workout\" confirming the focus on Pilates for the lower body.\n\nThe 'Mat' category also applies, though with lower emphasis, receiving a score of 0.7. Since the workout is designed to be performed at home, likely using a mat without additional equipment, this is corroborated by tags like \"mat pilates\" and \"home exercise.\" There are no indications of other equipment like weights, which would suggest another category. Therefore, Pilates is the dominant focus of this workout, with mat-based exercises supporting the classification."
