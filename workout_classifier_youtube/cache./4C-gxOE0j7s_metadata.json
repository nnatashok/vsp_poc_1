    "This was gorgeous! A practice like this is perfect because you can integrate this into any day, no matter how busy you are! Thank you Adriene!",
    "My trainer recommended I start my day with this... 2 wks later and I&#39;m still with it, before I take my morning walk.  I absolutely love it.  Thank you!",
    "Can I tell you how much you&#39;ve changed my life in the 28 days I&#39;ve been watching your videos. I have breast cancer and never could imagine being as strong, focused and balanced as I am today. Thank you with every fiber of my being.

    "Awesome short yoga practice today Adriene.  Thank you for this little beauty, it is good to reconnect to our bodies, especially in this fast paced, world that we live in. Before this practice I had a little awakening, and a realising everything, about me is connected. I&#39;ve always thought all my bits of personality were separate,  but there not there connected to each other. I know that might sound a little odd to some people,  but it makes sense to me. And it had helped me, to feel a bit more connected, and as one in life. Your yoga you teach me has helped me greatly, especially in finding myself, and getting through life&#39;s struggles. Thank you so much Adriene,  are a beautiful person inside, and out, and an awesome yoga teacher. See you again. Namaste. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83e\udde1\u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd8b"
