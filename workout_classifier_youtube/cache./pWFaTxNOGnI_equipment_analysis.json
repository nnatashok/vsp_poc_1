  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Breathing Exercises to Stop Panic Attack | Guided Breath Bubble, No Music' focuses on breathing techniques intended to relieve anxiety and panic attacks. The description and tags emphasize guided breathing exercises and mention a 'breath bubble' as a focal point for relaxation, which is not a physical piece of equipment. There is no indication of any physical activity or exercise that would require equipment such as mats, weights, or resistance gear. Comments and other metadata reinforce this focus on mental relief and guided breathwork without any physical apparatus. Therefore, it appears that no physical workout equipment is required for this video, confirming that the exercises are bodyweight and breathing technique-based only."
