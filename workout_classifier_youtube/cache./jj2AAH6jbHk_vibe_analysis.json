  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe, \"The Reboot Workout,\" is selected based on the focus on hip mobility and flexibility, aiming for a low stress, total body refresh. The metadata suggests a routine that enhances joint movement and can be used as a warm-up or cool down, aligning well with a 'reboot' quality. The explicit mention of flexibility and mobility in both the title and tags underscores this choice, and user comments reflect experiences of relief and refreshment, hence a score of 0.75.\n\nThe second vibe, \"The Foundation Builder,\" scores 0.65 as this workout addresses strengthening and improving fundamental movements, like hip rotation and squat flexibility. These are foundational elements in physical fitness, reinforcing basic but critical functions, as indicated by phrases like \"hip mobility exercises\" in the tags.\n\nLastly, \"The Zen Flow\" is applicable due to the calm, follow-along nature, and the non-intense, fluid approach typically associated with such routines. However, it scored less (0.45) because the primary focus is on mobility rather than being slow and intentional to the point of being meditative or breath-centered. The vibe selection is supported by descriptive elements such as keywords 'flow' and 'routine,' but user comments suggest more of a physical engagement rather than a meditative one. Overall, confidence is high due to clear indicators in the metadata."
