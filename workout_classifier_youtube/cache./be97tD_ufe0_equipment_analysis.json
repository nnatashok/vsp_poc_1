  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is centered around an 'Intermediate Full Body Elliptical Workout,' as explicitly stated in the title and description. The description specifies that the only equipment needed is an 'elliptical and a towel to wipe off.' The tags also include several references to 'elliptical workout,' reinforcing that the workout requires an elliptical. Furthermore, the description mentions varying resistance levels, which is a feature of elliptical machines. The confidence level is very high (1.0), as the elliptical is explicitly required and central to the workout."
