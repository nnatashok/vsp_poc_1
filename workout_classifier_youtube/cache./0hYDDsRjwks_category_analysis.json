  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as a 'Weight workout' with a very high confidence of 0.9. The title and description explicitly mention 'strength training with dumbbells,' which aligns directly with exercises using weights. The detailed description lists exercises like squats, shoulder presses, and curls, all of which involve dumbbells, further confirming the relevance of this category. The video structure indicates a focus on building strength across various muscle groups, including back, chest, and arms, typical of weight training.\n\nA secondary, minor classification under 'Body weight' with a score of 0.3 is considered due to some exercises, like the 'glute bridge walkouts,' which involves body weight resistance but remains significantly less central to the video's focus. The channel's broader content also supports a primary orientation towards strength training with equipment, as noted from the channel's description emphasizing cycle and strength training programs.\n\nOther possible categories like 'Mat' are excluded due to the focus on dumbbells rather than solely on floor or mat exercises. 'HIIT' is excluded as the structure (50 seconds work, 30 seconds rest) does not fit the high-intensity intervals associated with HIIT workouts."
