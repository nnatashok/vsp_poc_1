  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout spirit classification for this video primarily aligns with 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined'. The use of terms like 'intense', 'full body workout', 'muscle building', 'dumbbell workout', and emphasis on working out various major muscle groups suggest a physically demanding session, suitable for 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.8. The intense nature is supported by the fast-paced, high-impact music listed.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of structured exercises such as 'DB CURL SQUATS', 'DB CLEAN & PRESS', and 'SINGLE DB SNATCH', along with the phrase 'dumbbell only full body workout' indicates a methodical approach, warranting a 'Structured & Disciplined' classification at 0.7. The workout's pacing requires participants to follow along which adds to the discipline aspect.\n\nFlow & Rhythm was not selected as there is no emphasis on music-driven movement patterns. 'Soothing & Restorative' is excluded due to the intense and muscle-focused nature. Other potential spirits like 'Outdoor & Adventure', 'Sport & Agility' are irrelevant as the workout is indoor and equipment-based."
