  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata strongly suggests that the workout spirit is 'Soothing & Restorative.' The video title '10 Minute Guided Meditation for Focus' and the tags emphasize meditation, mindfulness, and focus on breathing. The description highlights using mindfulness to increase concentration and clarity, making it clear that the primary goal is mental relaxation and focus enhancement, both elements of a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The lack of music and the voice-only nature of the session further indicate a calming, focused approach, warranting a high score of 0.9 for this spirit. \n\nWhile 'Flow & Rhythm' might seem relevant due to the continuous guidance and mind-body connection involved in following a meditation practice, the absence of music and emphasis on voice-guided focus reduces its alignment. Therefore, it receives a low score of 0.3 as a mild match. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the inherently calm and focused nature of the practice which is centered around introspection rather than physical exertion or structured athletic training."
