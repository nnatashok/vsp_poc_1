  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves compound movements such as chest presses, squats, lunges, and variations of RDLs, which require a moderate level of coordination and balance but are not extremely complex. The inclusion of movements like the \"MAKER\" adds some complexity due to its combination of exercises. Intermediate classification is supported by the mention of compound movements and the requirement to use dumbbells, which demands a basic understanding of weightlifting form.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This 24-minute workout session with no repeated exercises and short rest periods (20 seconds) indicates a moderate to challenging effort level. The use of compound exercises and continuous work adds to the intensity. The exercise duration and dumbbell use suggest a moderate energy expenditure, while the short rest periods and complex final exercise increase the challenge. Comments also indicate that users experience significant physical gains, which correlate with challenging effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is suitable for a range of fitness levels. Although it is a 24-minute dumbbell workout, the ability to adjust weights allows inclusion of the Beginner level, albeit with lower confidence. Intermediate users are strongly catered to, given the mix of exercises that require some baseline fitness and coordination. Advanced users will also find it challenging due to the continuous nature and compound exercises. Metadata and comments suggest that users of varying fitness levels find the workout beneficial, supporting a multi-level fitness classification."
