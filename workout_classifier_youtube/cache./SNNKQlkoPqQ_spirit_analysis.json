  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is classified with a primary focus on 'Soothing & Restorative' (0.7) due to its emphasis on gentle, beginner-level stretching and flexibility. The title, '20 Minute Beginner Flexibility Routine V2! (FOLLOW ALONG),' and tags like 'beginner flexibility routine,' and 'how to get flexible,' suggest a low-intensity session designed to relieve tension and improve range of motion without stress, which aligns with a soothing and restorative quality. Viewer comments describing a sense of calm and life improvements further highlight this spirit.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit (0.65) is also relevant because the video follows a specific routine for flexibility improvement, as suggested by 'follow along,' and 'routine' in both the title and tags, alongside user comments about the regularity and structured guidance of the routine.\n\nLastly, 'Flow & Rhythm' (0.45) is present due to the 'follow along' nature of the routine, possibly incorporating smooth transitional stretches, suggested by comments about calm and specific directions, though it is not as strong as the other spirits. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Sport & Agility,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to lack of evidence in intensity, sports training, or outdoor involvement."
