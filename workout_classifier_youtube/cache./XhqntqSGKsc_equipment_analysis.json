  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata provided for the video does not mention any specific equipment required for this pregnancy workout. The video is labeled as a '30 Minute Pregnancy Workout' suitable for the second trimester but safe for all trimesters. There is no mention of mats, weights, or any other typical gym equipment in the title, description, tags, or comments. Furthermore, the channel specializes in pregnancy and postpartum workouts and emphasizes safety and accessibility, which often implies bodyweight exercises to accommodate a wider range of participants. There is an indication in the description of associated exercise styles like yoga, but without explicit mention of yoga equipment such as mats or blocks, it is reasonable to conclude that this workout is designed to be performed using bodyweight exercises."
