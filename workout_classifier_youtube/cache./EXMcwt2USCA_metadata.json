  "description": "Dr. Kevin Sarich DC, demonstrates another insane 20 minute HIIT workout using an elliptical to reach your fitness goals in minimal time. This is a workout you definitely want to try!\n\nThe elliptical is a mainstay in the gym for good reason: it's easy on the joints and provides a great cardio and total-body workout. But the elliptical can also get pretty boring and repetitive. \n\nThis elliptical workout will for sure change things up in a good way you're looking for!\n\nHIIT workouts - known as High Intensity Interval Training, are the most effective way to burn fat in the shortest amount of time possible. However, most people don't utilize this type of workout enough. \n\nIt's recommend to perform a 10-30 minute HIIT workout 2-3 times a week, with 24 hour rest in between HIIT workouts, in addition to other variety of fitness activities. \n\nThis elliptical trainer workout video is 20 minutes of HIIT training, going as hard as you can for 8 rounds of  30 seconds, spaced with 90 seconds of low intensity. \n\nWe start the elliptical workout with a 5 minute warm-up and finish the workout with a 3 minute cool-down. Please make sure you do both to reduce risk or injury!\n\nhttps://www.abundantyou.com/ - Natural Health Made Easy Blog\nhttps://www.abundantyouchiro.com chiropractor columbus ohio\n\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nCheck out our NEWEST killer HIIT video done on any type of static bike: \"HIIT Workout - Insane 25 Minute Spin Bike Workout\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_BlExYIimM\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",
