  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is best classified under 'Calisthenics' as the primary category with a score of 1.0, due to strong, explicit indicators in both the title and description that point to this workout style. The presence of phrases such as 'Calisthenics workout,' 'prepare you for skills like the human flag,' and 'exercise with full range of motion' directly aligns with traditional calisthenics practices. Additionally, the tags like 'calisthenics workout no equipment' and 'calisthenics full body workout' further reinforce this classification with high confidence. \n\nThe 'Body weight' category scores 0.75 because the workout involves using the body weight for resistance (as it mentions 'no equipment' and 'full body workout at home'). However, since calisthenics naturally encompass bodyweight exercises, the primary focus is calisthenics. The comments add context on the calisthenics nature and intensity of the workout, indicating participants find it challenging, which aligns with bodyweight elements.\n\nOther workout categories were not chosen since there is no indication of equipment use, specific flexibility work, or any other type of focus described in the metadata."
