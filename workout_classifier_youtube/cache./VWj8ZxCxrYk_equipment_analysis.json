  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video explicitly states in both the title, \"15 MIN BEGINNER CARDIO Workout (At Home No Equipment),\" and the description, \"No equipment needed. Just yourself!\" that no equipment is required to perform the exercises. The tags, such as \"no equipment cardio workout,\" \"at home cardio workout no equipment,\" and \"beginner home workout,\" reinforce this by emphasizing that it is an equipment-free routine designed for home use. The channel focuses on at-home workouts, which can often be bodyweight-only. Although there is a mention of a mat in the description, this is presented as a personal preference for comfort rather than a necessity, as evidenced by the statement, \"THE MAT I USE (Exercise 6X4),\" without implying it's required for the workout. Comments show a focus on the workout experience rather than any equipment, supporting the conclusion that the workout is bodyweight-only."
