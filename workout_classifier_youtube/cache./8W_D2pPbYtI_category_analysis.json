  "categoriesExplanation": "The category 'Pilates' was chosen due to multiple strong indicators in the metadata. The video title explicitly states 'full body pilates workout,' which directly aligns with the Pilates category. Additionally, the channel description mentions that the creator, Lidia Mera, is a certified Pilates instructor, reinforcing the focus on Pilates. Top comments also provide support, as users reference using these workouts as part of a health routine, with improvements in core strength and general physical wellness, which are common benefits of Pilates.\n\nThe high categories confidence (0.95) and score (0.9) reflect strong evidence from the title ('pilates workout'), channel background ('certified Pilates instructor'), and comments affirming the Pilates association and outcomes. Other categories were not considered due to the lack of relevant keywords or context suggesting them in the metadata."
