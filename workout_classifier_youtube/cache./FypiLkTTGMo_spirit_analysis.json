  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is primarily characterized by the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as indicated by several key elements in the metadata. The title includes 'Calm - Ease' and 'Guided Meditation,' which are strong indicators of relaxation and healing focus. The description emphasizes 'cultivate calm, ease, and joy,' aligning perfectly with a soothing purpose. Tags such as 'mindfulness meditation' and 'meditation for anxiety' further reinforce the restful and recovery aspects. Additionally, viewer comments like 'Beautiful' and expressions of gratitude towards Thich Nhat Hanh for teachings that have a calming effect bolster this classification.\n\nThere's a minor association with 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the structured nature of meditation practices that often involve rhythmic breathing and mindfulness flow, as well as the audio-guided format which may create a rhythmic engagement. However, the main focus remains on restoration and peace. The channel is dedicated to mindfulness and Thich Nhat Hanh's teachings, known for their meditative and peaceful content, further solidifying the healing spirit. Other spirits are excluded due to a lack of alignment with intense, structured, or adventure-focused elements."
