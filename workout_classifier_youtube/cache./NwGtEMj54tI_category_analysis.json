  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Breathing exercises' with a score of 1. This is due to the emphasis on breathwork throughout the video, as clearly indicated by terms such as 'guided breathwork session', 'breathing techniques', and 'parasympathetic nervous system' in the description, as well as the repeated mention of breathing-related tags like 'guidedbreathwork', 'breathingexercises', and 'breathworkforanxiety'. Additionally, the channel specializes in breathwork exercises, reinforcing this classification.\n\n'Meditation' is assigned as a secondary category with a score of 0.7. This is supported by tags like 'meditation' and 'sleepmeditation', as well as the meditative intent of the session to calm the mind and induce restful sleep. The video also seems to have a relaxation and mindfulness component, which aligns with meditative practices.\n\nThe focus on calming music, relaxation, and the target outcome of achieving restful sleep, also seen in user comments, further support these categories. However, the lack of explicit guidance or structured meditative techniques makes the 'Meditation' score slightly lower."
