    "I get bored easily and your NO REPEAT workouts are perfect for me. Please make more of the 30-minute ones. Love them!",
    "Another great workout! Y&#39;all have helped lose 130 lbs and continue to help me maintain \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb thank you both!",
    "J&amp;T let me say thank you. I\u2019m 58 and was doing a CV workout daily and added weight training every other day. I was only doing 15 minutes of weightlifting because it was boring. Found you guys a month ago and now I do strength training for 30 minutes every other day and I can see the difference. The music and how you break down the sets has made me a life long follower. You guys are Awesome.",
    "I don\u2019t say it enough, but I am so grateful for y\u2019all. My days are immensely better when I start them with you. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe",
    "Thanks again y&#39;all!  Appreciate you both."
