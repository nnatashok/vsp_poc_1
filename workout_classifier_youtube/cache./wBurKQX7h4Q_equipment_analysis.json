  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The 20 Minute Fat Burning Workout video by Global Cycling Network is explicitly focused on indoor cycling, as indicated by several pieces of metadata. The title mentions a workout, and the description specifies that it is an indoor cycling training session suitable for a turbo trainer, rollers, or other cycle trainers. Tags such as 'spin,' 'spinning,' 'indoor cycling,' and 'cycling workout' further reinforce that the exercises are based around cycling. Additionally, the description refers to Wahoo Fitness, which is known for cycling equipment, and there is a mention of riding the workout in The Sufferfest app, which is often used with cycling trainers. Therefore, with very high confidence, an exercise bike or similar indoor cycling apparatus is necessary to perform this workout effectively."
