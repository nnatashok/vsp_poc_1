However, the intermediate score reflects the slight complexity and sustained effort involved in pilates, as some comments note the intensity yet basic nature of the class. The scoring accounts for the slightly more engaging nature of pilates, which can appeal to beginners and intermediate users looking for a foundational yet slightly challenging workout."
