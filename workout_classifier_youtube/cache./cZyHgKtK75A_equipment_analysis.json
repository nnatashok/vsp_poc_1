  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata of the workout video, including the title, description, and channel information, suggests a bodyweight-only workout with no equipment required. The title 'Cardio Workout At Home - 30 Min Aerobic Exercise' indicates the workout is cardio-based, typically involving movements like jumping jacks, jogging in place, or other bodyweight exercises. The description emphasizes that the workout can be done easily at home and focuses on burning calories, again typical of bodyweight cardio routines. The channel description explicitly states, 'No equipment or gym necessary,' reinforcing the idea that no equipment is required for this workout. Furthermore, none of the tags or comments mention any specific equipment, supporting the classification of this workout as bodyweight only."
