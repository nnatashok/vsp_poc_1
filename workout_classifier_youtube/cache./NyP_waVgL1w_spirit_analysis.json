  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily characterized by 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.8. This is based on the Pilates focus, which typically emphasizes smooth, continuous movement that enhances coordination and a mind-body connection. Words like 'pilates', 'movement', and Nicole's background as a former dancer and her emphasis on classes that guide you \"to your best feeling self\" suggest a rhythmic and fluid approach in the workout.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant with a score of 0.6, as this workout is tailored for beginners and described as an option for those who want to \"slow things down.\" This, combined with comments indicating accessibility and careful guidance (e.g., \"keep talking\" for a visually impaired viewer), supports a more gentle, restorative approach.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit scores 0.5 due to the systematic and methodical nature of Pilates training, as suggested by the precise movements and Nicole's credentials as a certified instructor. The structured nature is evident in the description and tags such as 'Pilates for Beginners.'\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the focus on gentle, beginner-friendly movements without a high-intensity push, and there's no indication of outdoor settings or sport-specific activities, ruling out 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Sport & Agility.'"
