    "So good to see a routine constructed by someone who has walked the walk :)",
    "I love the vibe... no yelling, just good music, and great movement.",
    "I love your workout routines so much.  Only 2 things that would make them perfection.  1. Give a voice over when you\u2019re about to switch to the next exercise informing us what\u2019s about to come so we don\u2019t have to look at the screen when we hear the beep, those of us that know the exercise\u2019s can jump right into the next    2. Take a little bit longer on the stretching at the end. Even just 5 additional seconds for each stretch would make it feel less rushed and would give more stretching benefits.",
    "Day 1: I struggled to the point that I litterally started crying \ud83d\ude03 will do again I\u2019m tired of being weak",
    "Dude I&#39;m so mad I did calisthenics for months every day and then just stopped.  I&#39;m starting up again today I hope I can stick to it I know those wall sits got my legs screamin. Lol anyone reading this, you CAN DO IT! I have faith in you"
