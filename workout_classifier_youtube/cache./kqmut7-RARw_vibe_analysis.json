  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled \"45 Min Yoga Routine | Full Body Beginner Friendly Yoga\" from the channel Charlie Follows explicitly describes a steady vinyasa flow, which is indicative of 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The description emphasizes a grounding practice with elements like sun salutations, hip openers, and balanced breathing, aligning strongly with this vibe (score: 0.8). 'The Meditative Grind' emerges as a secondary vibe due to the repetitive, methodical nature of yoga sequences that enhance strength and flexibility over time, as evidenced by user comments appreciating the slow and mindful pace (score: 0.7). 'The Reboot Workout' is a moderate fit as it offers a full-body refresh ideal for all levels, making it slightly suitable for a refreshing daily routine, mentioned by several users noticing improved body and mind awareness (score: 0.4). The overall vibe confidence is high due to consistent emphasis on grounding, mindful movement, and steady progression."
