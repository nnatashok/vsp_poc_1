  "vibesExplanation": "The workout's primary focus on box breathing, explicitly described as a calming and stress-reducing technique used by Navy SEALs, strongly fits 'The Deep Recharge' vibe. This vibe is about nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement, aligning perfectly with the practice's aim in calming anxiety and resetting breath. The high number of positive testimonials about its calming effects, such as improved sleep and anxiety reduction, reinforce this classification, leading to a high confidence score of 0.85 and a strong match score of 0.8.\n\n'The Zen Flow' vibe is relevant due to the breath-centered, intentional practice described in the tags and description. Terms like 'calm', 'meditation', and 'stress relief' suggest a grounding and unhurried session, making it a noticeable but secondary fit with a score of 0.7.\n\nLastly, 'The Reboot Workout' is relevant as the session is designed for relaxation and total-body refresh, indicated by user comments noting improved anxiety levels and the video's focus on breath work rather than intense physical activity, meriting a score of 0.6. The descriptions and tags support this, although with slightly less direct alignment."
