  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"800 Steps Express 5 Minute Fat Burner\" is labeled as a low-impact, quick cardio workout. The metadata, including tags such as \"Walking Workout,\" \"Dance Workout,\" and \"Low Impact Cardio,\" suggests exercises that likely involve bodyweight movements or simple walking and dance steps. The description highlights that this session is a quick, high-intensity interval designed to be done in a short amount of time, which is typical for bodyweight or minimal equipment exercises. There are no specific mentions of workout equipment in the title, description, or tags, nor do the top comments or channel information suggest the use of any particular equipment. The frequent use of terms like \"Low Impact Exercise\" and \"Dance That Walk\" further suggests an equipment-free workout. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, requiring no additional equipment."
