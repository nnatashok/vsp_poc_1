    "Caroline ...Ok so I am absolutely not writing this to show off, but I am 74 and I am writing it to encourage those of you much younger than I - folks in their 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s and yes 70&#39;s - to push through these workouts. This morning I previewed this and thought &quot;No way&quot;, but guess what? I completed it. Yes it took me an hour with longer rests and some modifications on the burpees. A 74 year old body can just do so much, but I feel incredible as I write this and encouraged and I would never have thought when I began Epic I and followed with the other Epics (although I have worked out for about 30 years) that I would have become so strong and had such beautiful definition in  my rather old body. So, keep the faith and push through. Thank you Caroline. I look forward to your workouts every day.",
    "I have a confession to make: during EPIC 1 and 2 i&#39;ve havent done the sunday HIIT often. I did the ones the where low impact and with weights. I did not have confidence in me that i could do it. I was seeing you going so fast and i knew i just could not keep up. Today&#39;s intro was a blessing, hearing you say that it did not have to be perfect and that we have to build up to a certain pace. So today i did the wokout... changed a few things (jumping lunge to no jumping lunge) and i am really proud of myself. Done the extra abs and the 20 mins strech. Thank you Caroline.",
    "This week was so tough yet so much fun! This is the perfect way to end week one ! <br>I and everyone in this community must be able to realise how much planning,  mental efforts as well as hard work is put into every single video.. So for those of you who are doing the workouts but have not subscribed yet, pleaase do it right now!!! Our Caroline deserves 100M!!",
    "Caroline woke up on this day and chose violence\ud83e\udd23 What. A. Ripper.<br>I thoroughly enjoyed this and am super proud to report that I only paused the video once around 35% in. After that, it was like my body remembered how to differentiate between feeling like I&#39;m dying and actual death - which was super helpful going forward. I will admit, I find two sets in a HIIT workout challenging because my boy is absolutely convinced that I won&#39;t survive a second round most of the time, even though it  does consistently do so. So from a mental fortitude aspect, I feel like I&#39;ve come quite far.<br>Thanks for all your hard work, Caroline &lt;3<br>I largely feel like I&#39;m doing these workouts alone because this programme was live just over a year ago, but the comments posted by those who participated and your constant presence throughout the workout help me keep going.<br>Much love and appreciation from South Africa &lt;3<br>Stay safe and strong everyone!",
    "When staple exercise is a burpee, you know legs are gonna be squishy after this one...<br>Can&#39;t wait to complete this workout...<br>Have a great workout and a great day everyone"
