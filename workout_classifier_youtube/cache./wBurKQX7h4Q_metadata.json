    "I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that this video is magic. It makes the 30 second recoveries seem like 3 seconds, and the 30 second efforts seem like 3 days.",
    "Been on this 20 min HITT 3X a week. Tues Thur &amp; Sat for a year. I\u2019ve dropped 70lbs of fat!! It\u2019s been a big part since f saving my life. Thanks GCN",
    "Fired from old job...got new job....waking up at 4 in the morning doing this awesome workout that is just contributing to a positive new perspective I&#39;ve found in life.",
    "This single training video is the primary base for my HIIT workouts. I do it 3 times a week, supplemented with 3X weekly strength workouts and 20/4 intermittent daily fasting to keep me fit into my 60s.",
    "So far the best, most motivating and clearest instructions of any YouTube spin class."
