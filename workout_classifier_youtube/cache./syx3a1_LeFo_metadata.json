    "i&#39;m still a teenager and lost my mom 2 weeks ago unexpectedly,  this is the first time i&#39;ve been truly able to find peace within myself since finding her. thank you.",
    "I wish everyone the happiest lives they could live. You deserve it. You\u2019re worth something, don\u2019t ever doubt it.",
    "I have learned through mindfulness that a thought is just a thought. Not to attach myself to it. I like hearing that. Its  wonderful!",
    "30 years old. Lost 8 years of my life surrendering to mental illness then to substance addiction. Have cut back on addictions a lot, but am withdrawing from extreme stimulation, namely dopamine. I have been zoning out a lot even being socially awkward because my brain chemistry is readjusting. I gotta do this, gotta change and become the person to have the life I want. We all here are worth that. <br><br>I did this just now for first time. First few minutes were boring, middle few minutes agonizing thoughts of toxic self defeat and bitter sadness, last few were serenity and hope. I&#39;m a man who never cries and I honestly feel like it right now. <br><br>Sending love and energy to you all.",
    "I was in the middle of having the biggest emotional breakdown of my life, this video calmed me down and let me be in a neutral place. I can&#39;t thank you enough. I now release all the negativity I have been clinging onto. I allow love and peace to enter."
