    "I love these! I would love to see more babywearing workouts since it&#39;s the only way I can do workouts at the moment lol.",
    "great workout! Baby won&#39;t let me put him down most days. Babywearing workouts take away my excuses and help me show up for myself :) thanks!",
    "If you weren\u2019t already the reason I had such a beautiful pregnancy and easy birth. I didn\u2019t think I would be desperate enough to YouTube \u201cbaby wearing workout\u201d and Lowe and behold, you pop up. Thank you so much for creating this content to benefit mums throughout pregnancy, birth and postpartum. I really appreciate you \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc",
    "My sweet boy is almost three weeks old and it is a life saver for me! He hates to be put down anywhere he will scream unless he\u2019s in my arms, this allows me to move around the house and actually get a few things done which is super helpful, he typically falls asleep in there as well, I highly recommend this!",
    "My restless 10 weeks-old-baby fells asleep halfway trough.. so nice! I never heard of \u2018kangatraining\u2019 nut this was a fantastic first exercise. I did it in the kitchen with three other kids around:) And the little one wakes up when I complete\u2026"
