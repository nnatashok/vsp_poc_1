  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of generally straightforward exercises like squats, lunges, and planks, which are typical for beginners, while some movements like 'Pike Push Ups' and 'Superman Lat Pull Downs' require a bit more coordination and strength, reflecting intermediate difficulty. No advanced techniques are indicated, and since it is a no-equipment workout, it minimizes apparatus-related complexity. This classification accounts for the moderate complexity of bodyweight exercises with minimal risk for beginners, while acknowledging some exercises may require familiarity with correct body mechanics, classifying them as intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 20-minute HIIT workout with 45-second intervals and 15-second rest suggests a moderate to challenging effort level. The continuous nature and variety in exercises like 'Burpees' and 'High Knees' indicate higher cardiovascular demand, characteristic of more challenging workouts, but the relatively short total duration tempers this. The workout is suitable for building stamina and calorie burn without being excessively intense or extreme, hence rating between moderate and challenging for general participants, especially given the focus on calorie burning and the user's potential to scale the workout intensity.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the technique and effort difficulties, this workout is suitable for a range from beginners to advanced users, given its HIIT structure. Beginners can attempt this workout due to accessible movements and the video offering modifications implicitly through no equipment. Intermediate users are likely well-matched to the workout structure's higher intensity demands. For advanced fitness levels, while the exercises may not provide enough complexity, the pacing can still present a worthwhile effort. Thus, this analysis provides a wide scope of applicability, aligning with the video target of offering accessible yet effective training."
