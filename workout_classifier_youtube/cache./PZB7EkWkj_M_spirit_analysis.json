  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is predominantly characterized by 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the continuous, smooth nature of a vinyasa yoga flow. This is evident from the title '45 MIN FULL BODY YOGA FLOW' and tags such as 'daily yoga flow' and 'vinyasa yoga flow', which emphasize fluid and rhythmic movement. The description also highlights balance, flexibility, and strength - core elements of flow. The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also notably present, given the workout's focus on opening hips and shoulders and leaving participants feeling good, as mentioned in the description and comments. Many commenters express emotional and mental wellbeing improvements, further aligning with a restorative spirit. High confidence in both spirits comes from the channel's focus on movement that feels good, evidenced by the channel description and positive user comments about enhanced mental peace and emotional connection. Other spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined', are less applicable given the gentle, flow-based nature of yoga."
