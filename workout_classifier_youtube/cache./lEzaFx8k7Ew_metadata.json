  "description": "Enjoy deeper relaxation and increase lung capacity with this 15 minute version of the 4-7-8 breathing technique. The breaths gradually slow and extend to an ideal calming pace.\n\n4-7-8 rhythmic breathing is a core part of many meditation and yoga practices as it promotes relaxation and can also be used to help you fall asleep in a shorter period of time. The goal is to calm your sympathetic nervous system, which controls the fight-or-flight response. \n\nNOTE: In this video, the 4-7-8 counting does not follow seconds (the pace is purposefully slower). There are other versions of the 4-7-8 exercise on this channel that have a faster breathing pace and versions that have a slower breathing pace. You should try them all to learn what works best for you.\n\nIf you tend to be a shallow breather, it\u2019s common to feel a little lightheaded when you start taking deeper breaths. This sensation will pass as your body becomes accustomed to a greater flow of oxygen. You can always take a short break and resume the exercise once you feel normal. It is not necessary that your timing perfectly matches the video example. You can take shorter or longer breaths as long as you maintain the ratio - Inhale 4, Hold 7, Exhale 8. Also, try to keep your expectations realistic. Some days will be easier than others, but the more often you practice, the more effective the exercise becomes.\n\n\n\n//  STRUGGLING TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH?\n\nIf you are having difficulty taking a deep enough breath to complete the 4-7-8 exercise, you may wish to begin with a simple video that teaches proper abdominal breathing.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ApAsKd4hYiw\n\n\n\n//  GUIDED HANDS-ON MEDITATIONS\n\nIf you would like to try meditation, I encourage you to try the Hands-On Meditation technique. It's easier than traditional meditation.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzK1U3HzIGbgtuKVCRmXgOV8U1RzC_xcC\n\n\n\n// SOCIAL\n\n\u2022 Instagram https://www.instagram.com/HandsOnMeditation\n\n\u2022 Pinterest https://www.pinterest.com/HandsOnMeditate\n\n\u2022 Twitter https://twitter.com/HandsOnMeditate\n\n\u2022 Facebook https://www.facebook.com/HandsOnMeditation\n\n#HandsOnMeditation\n\nWANT TO HELP SUPPORT THE CHANNEL?\n\u2615 Please, buy me a coffee  https://www.buymeacoffee.com/HandsOnMeditate\n\n________________________\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this approach to anxiety and stress relief.

    "This is literally the only thing that clams me down and that makes me relaxed. This is perfect, no long intros, no loud or annoying music just pure peacefulness along with his voice. My favorite part is being able to hear the breathing out. Thank you for this.",
    "I saw brain rewire documentary in bbc channel (YouTube). A women did breathing meditation  30mins daily. Doctors scaned her brain before n post 6 weeks. Doctors seen significant difference in brain. The brains stuctures got changed. I.e The neural lines were changed. She felt patient before taking actions to her thoughts. She told shes thinks how to respond on every action. not blindly doing immediate response.<br><br>Good video.",
    "one can start slow at first,then build up to the max rerquirement for great results. thanks. the breath of life, monks have done this for ages.....slow down,take a pause,breath...   peace be with you....",
    "Been using this video for 20 days. Initially found it tough to do it for 15 minutes. Slowly got there. Key is a slow inhale so it lasts four seconds and let the belly fill up. And purse your lips while you breathe out through your mouth. I have saved the video offline in case I am not able to access the internet. Thank you for this.",
