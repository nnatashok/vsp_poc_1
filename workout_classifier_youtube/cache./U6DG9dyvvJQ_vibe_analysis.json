  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled '3 Day Calisthenics Workout Plan | FULL PROGRAM' primarily aligns with 'The Progression Quest' vibe due to its focus on structuring a workout routine with levels for beginners to advanced, indicating methodical, incremental improvement. The title and repeated emphasis on a structured plan and incremental progress in calisthenics suggest a strong match for this vibe, given endorsements in comments about progressing from zero push-ups to multiple, and achieving new exercises like pull-ups. This earned a high confidence score of 0.9 due to explicit indicators.\n\n'VibesConfidence': The inclusion of specific options for different skill levels and exercises geared towards developing specific skills such as handstands and muscle building also aligns with 'The Masterclass Workout'. The emphasis on technique and skill-building elements points to this vibe, scoring a 0.7 as it's clearly presented but secondary to the overall program progression approach.\n\nFurthermore, the focus on leg and upper body routine and calisthenics as a foundational fitness routine lends some elements to 'The Foundation Builder', as strengthening basics and rebuilding are key aspects mentioned explicitly in the video and description, earning a moderate score of 0.6. \n\nThe overall confidence in these classifications is high due to explicit content in the metadata supporting these interpretations, and the comprehensive nature of the workout plan that encourages regular progression and mastery."
