  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout in the video is clearly centered around a seated workout using a chair, as indicated by the repeated mentions in the title, tags, and description such as '20-Minute Seated Workout: Cardio + Core (No Equipment, No Repeat)' and '20-Minute Chair Cardio + Core (No Equipment, No Repeat)'. The description explicitly lists 'Chair or Box/Bench' as the equipment needed, making it a central component of this workout. Tags such as 'Chair Cardio, No Equipment Chair Workout, chair workout, chair workouts, Chair Exercises' reinforce the chair's necessity, providing a high confidence score of 0.9. There is no indication of other equipment being used or required, as the focus is on a seated workout that specifically accommodates participants with injuries, hence emphasizing no additional equipment beyond the chair."
