  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily categorized as a \"Weight workout\" with a score of 1 due to the explicit mention of dumbbells in the title, tags, and description, indicating the predominant use of weights for strength training. Phrases like \"dumbbell strength\" and \"muscle building dumbbell workout\" strongly suggest the centrality of weights.\n\nAdditionally, a secondary category of \"Body weight\" is considered, though with a lower score of 0.4. This is because the description mentions \"basic strength training movements\" and \"isometric holds,\" which might involve some exercises using one's body weight in conjunction with weights. The lack of specific mention of calisthenics or extensive bodyweight exercises limits the confidence of this category.\n\nOverall, the high confidence level of 0.95 is due to the strong and consistent emphasis on weight lifting throughout the metadata, with little ambiguity in the workout's focus on dumbbell exercises."
