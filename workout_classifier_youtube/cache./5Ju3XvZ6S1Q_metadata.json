    "It&#39;s amazing how yoga can connect to your emotions. When in pigeon pose I started to cry. I&#39;m getting married tomorrow and my Dad can&#39;t be there because he passed away in January. This big surge of emotion took over me in that posture and I thought of him and my tears dropped onto the mat. Yoga can be very healing, thank you Bird.",
    "This felt so good. I\u2019m only 20 but my muscles are horribly painful from being a full time early childcare worker as well as having just recovered from severe depression and sleep disorders that left me basically bedridden for years. The gentle reminders that it was ok to modify the poses so they didn\u2019t heart made me feel so at peace and I\u2019m hoping that this will become a daily ritual for me",
    "This is so peaceful and comfortable, I felt like didn\u2019t want to end the session.",
    "Thank you for making this 15 minutes; it was much less intimidating than a longer video- for a beginner like me at least."
