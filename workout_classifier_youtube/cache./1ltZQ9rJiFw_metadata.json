  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible to feel like I got an excellent workout but also feel relaxed at the same time. Somehow Nicole always does it! So positive and uplifting. Nicole always leaves me feeling physically and mentally recharged. Thank you!",
    "I stopped the gym and now start my day with pilates/yoga, your my favourite teacher!",
    "I&#39;ve tried different pilates channels, different apps, and different accounts. But I still come back to Nicole&#39;s YouTube channel. I definitely feel good here. She&#39;s the best."
