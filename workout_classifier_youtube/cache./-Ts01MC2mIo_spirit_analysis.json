  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit identified for this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' with very high confidence (0.9). The title, description, and target audience focus on gentle, supportive exercise suitable for seniors and those with limited mobility, as evidenced by phrases like 'soft and gentle,' 'supportive,' and 'stabilizing.' User comments further support this classification, describing feelings of relaxation, improved mobility, and suitability for individuals managing health issues or recovering from illness. \n\nAdditionally, there are elements of 'Flow & Rhythm' (score 0.5) to a moderate degree. Although it's a seated practice, terms like 'mobility,' 'energy flow,' and the structured nature of yoga can imply the rhythmic and continuous nature characteristic of flow. This is less dominant than the restorative aspect but still present in its execution and benefits. \n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the gentle and calming focus that contrasts with any notions of high intensity or athletic training."
