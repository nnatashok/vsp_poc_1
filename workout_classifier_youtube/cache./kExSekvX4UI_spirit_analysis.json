  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Stretches for Spasticity With Multiple Sclerosis (Easy to do and Guided!!)' from the 'MS Workouts' channel primarily embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This is evident from the emphasis on stretching to relieve spasticity, a gentle approach ideal for those with MS, focusing on pain relief and safe practice. The description explicitly mentions the stretches 'lengthen the muscles in the lower back,' suggesting a restorative intention aimed at alleviating discomfort (score: 0.95). Moreover, the video's target audience includes individuals with mobility challenges, further suggesting a focus on healing and relaxation.\n\nA secondary spirit could be 'Flow & Rhythm,' as the exercise involves movement patterns that may promote a sense of flow and coordination while stretching (score: 0.45). However, the primary intent leans towards restoration rather than continuous rhythmic activity, accounting for the lower score.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are not applicable due to the gentle and specific nature of the exercise designed for MS patients, aimed at alleviating symptoms, not pushing physical limits."
