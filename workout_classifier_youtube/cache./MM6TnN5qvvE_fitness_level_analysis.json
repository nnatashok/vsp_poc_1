  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout primarily consists of indoor cycling intervals, a low-skill activity that requires little coordination or advanced technique, aligning it with a Beginner level. The rating is based on the simplicity of pedaling, where minimal technique is needed beyond adjusting intensity levels on a stationary cycle. However, due to the nuances of maintaining specific RPMs and resistance levels, there is a mild alignment with Intermediate, particularly for ensuring optimal cycling form and maximizing workout benefit.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is rated as Challenging, due to the inclusion of 'all-out efforts' noted in the description and the high-effort intervals represented by the 10/10 intensity levels during the workout. The short time frame of 15 minutes combined with these intense intervals can be quite taxing and is noted in user comments describing it as 'brutal'. However, it also fits moderately with Moderate effort, as the shorter duration itself mitigates potential exhaustive energy expenditure that would be seen in longer sessions.",

  ],
  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level spans Beginner to Advanced. Beginners may find the workout accessible due to the simplicity of cycling and the ability to self-regulate intensity (choosing lighter resistance settings). Intermediate users align well with the nature of the HIIT format and ability to handle multiple high-intensity bursts. Advanced users could also benefit due to the scalable challenge provided by the 10/10 intensity peaks, allowing them to push endurance and cardiovascular limits further. The channel's cycling-centric audience suggests familiarity with indoor cycling nuances, incrementally enhancing the classification confidence for Intermediate and Beginner levels."
