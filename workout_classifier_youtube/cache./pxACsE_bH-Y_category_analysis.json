  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video \"Birth Ball Exercises For Easy Delivery\" was classified into the 'Mat', 'Yoga', and 'Stretching' categories. \n\nThe 'Mat' category was given a score of 0.7 as the exercises likely involve movements performed on the floor using a birth ball, aligning with general floor exercises often done on a mat. The use of a 'birth ball' indicates low-impact, mat-based exercises, which is also reinforced by the terms like \"birth ball exercises\" in the title and description.\n\nThe 'Yoga' category received a score of 0.6. Although not explicitly labeled as yoga, the description mentions 'pregnancy yoga cards', and the channel commonly features prenatal yoga content. Additionally, yoga is often incorporated in pregnancy routines to aid flexibility and relaxation, aligning with the video\u2019s focus on preparing for labor.\n\nThe 'Stretching' category was assigned a score of 0.5 due to references to exercises that \"prepare for easy delivery\", suggesting movements that promote flexibility and relaxation, a key characteristic of stretching exercises. The top comments highlighting feelings of empowerment and preparation for labor further suggest a component of stretching and relaxation.\n\nOther categories like 'Pilates' or 'Body Weight' were considered but excluded due to a lack of specific indicators in the metadata or comments reflecting core or resistance training focus. The video emphasis on pregnancy-specific, non-intensive exercises supports the chosen categories and scores."
