  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a score of 0.9, based on emphasis on flexibility, joint health, and muscle strength through gentle movements. The title \"Full Body Stretching Routine\" and descriptions of exercises targeting recovery, daily use, and promoting flexibility align with a restorative focus. Viewer comments highlight improvements in flexibility, making it a regular routine for physical well-being, further indicating its soothing nature. \n\nAdditionally, the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is assigned a score of 0.7 due to the 'full body' approach and 'follow along' elements that suggest a rhythmic, continuous sequence, although not as predominant as the restorative aspect. The routine is stated as beneficial for beginners and advanced athletes, suggesting a versatile flow adaptable to different fitness levels.\n\nThe channel 'Strength Side' is dedicated to physical and mental transformation through movement, supporting these spirits. Potential spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' were excluded due to a lack of specific protocol or technical emphasis in the routine."
