  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title and tags explicitly mention the 'Elliptical workout' and 'elliptical trainer,' indicating that an elliptical is central to the workout. The description provides detailed instructions for performing the workout on an elliptical machine, with specific intervals designed for this equipment, and suggests alternate exercises if an elliptical is unavailable (such as treadmill or biking, which reinforces its primary focus). The confidence score for the elliptical is 1.0, reflecting explicit and repeated references in the metadata that confirm its necessity for completing the workout effectively. No other equipment is required as the video solely focuses on an elliptical workout."
