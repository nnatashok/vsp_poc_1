  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata for the video 'Yoga To Feel Your Best | 22-Minute Home Yoga' strongly aligns with the 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits. The description emphasizes 'conscious breath' and 'stretch your body', which suggests a focus on smooth, continuous movement and breath-work consistent with the Flow & Rhythm spirit (score: 0.75). This is further supported by the channel's focus on yoga and the tag 'yoga at home', indicating a session geared towards mind-body connection.\n\nMoreover, the description's mention of participants 'feeling good', 'stretch your body', and 'embrace it' points towards a restorative quality, aimed at relaxation and personal well-being. Comments like \"highlights the magic of yoga\" and the channel's emphasis on inclusivity and finding what feels good suggest a primary focus on healing and restorative practices, thus aligning well with Soothing & Restorative (score: 0.8).\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are less relevant due to lack of indicators for intensity or athleticism in the metadata."
