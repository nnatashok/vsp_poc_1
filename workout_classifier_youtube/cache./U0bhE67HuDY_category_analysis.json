  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Weight workout,' as evidenced by the title and description, which emphasize 'beginner weight training' and 'strength training for beginners.' The numerous tags like 'beginner weight training,' 'weight lifting beginners,' and 'beginner weight workout' also strongly support this classification, justifying a high score of 0.9. The focus is on using weights, likely referring to dumbbells as suggested by the channel's emphasis on dumbbell exercises.\n\nA secondary category considered is 'Body weight,' given the availability of exercise modifications that might include bodyweight exercises. However, this is only slightly evident from the metadata, particularly from the comments and review of workout flexibility which mention general fitness without specific equipment focus, hence a lower score of 0.3.\n\nAlternative categories like 'HIIT' or 'Calisthenics' are not applicable here due to the lack of any interval training or specific gymnastic movements mentioned. The explanation and metadata lean heavily towards structured weight training, eliminating other categories."
