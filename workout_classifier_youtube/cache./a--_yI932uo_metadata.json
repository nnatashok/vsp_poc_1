    "Gosh,  I workout everyday,  cardio,  strength with weights,  pilates, barre ... but this was the toughest workout since a while.  She just never disappoints",
    "I&#39;ve done this workout once a week for three weeks.  Each time I can do a little more than the last.  The goal now is to be able to get through the whole thing with no modifications or rests in two months.  Thanks for posting this.",
    "Hi everyone...it seems to have been a quite a while since we did a calisthenics full body workout! Thus series has been so fantastic so I think today will be a real treat! I really like the rep based complexes that we are doing and I\u2019m really looking forward to this! Have a great workout and a lovely weekend everybody! Matthew",
    "This was one of the most challenging workouts I&#39;ve done, especially the low to high plank and uneven push up section!  The yoga block really makes a difference, I love it! Thank you Caroline!",
    "A great part about your videos is that you humanize yourself, sometimes you stop and struggle and that makes it relatable. We&#39;re suffering. But you&#39;re suffering with us."
