  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title of the video '30 MINUTE HIIT | Treadmill Workout Follow Along #IBXRunning' explicitly mentions a treadmill workout, indicating that a treadmill is essential for this workout. Furthermore, the tags such as 'Treadmill workout', 'free treadmill workout', and 'treadmill running videos' reinforce its necessity. The description details running intervals with speed adjustments which inherently require a treadmill to execute effectively. Comments from users also reference their positive experiences with the treadmill workout, confirming its central role in the exercise. Therefore, I have assigned a very high confidence score of 1.0 for the treadmill as required equipment for this workout."
