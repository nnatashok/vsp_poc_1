  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'The Comfort Moves' with high confidence (score 0.8) due to its prenatal focus, ensuring a safe and accessible approach for pregnant individuals. Terms like \"pregnancy-safe cardio\" in the title and the assurance in the description that this is a personal routine aimed at prenatal fitness emphasize comfort and health safety. Additionally, user comments suggest the workout is accessible but still effective, indicating a focus on safe and cozy fitness suitable for prenatal users. \n\nThere is also a moderate match with 'The Reboot Workout' (score 0.6), evidenced by the emphasis on a low-stress and energizing cardio session. The mention of feeling 'great after' and a 'quick and effective' experience aligns with the concept of a refreshing, low-stress workout, as reflected in user comments about feeling good post-workout. However, it lacks the deep stretch or holistic recovery focus, aligning it only moderately with this vibe."
