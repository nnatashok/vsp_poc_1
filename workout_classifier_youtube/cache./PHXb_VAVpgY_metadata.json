    "My second comment but don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not a comment stalker. I&#39;ve done this a few times now. I&#39;ve gone from being able to jog for 30 seconds non stop (no laughing please), to up to 3 minutes non stop!! I&#39;ve got the jogging bug now. I loves it I do. And a big thanks to you and your vids.",
