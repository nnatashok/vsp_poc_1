  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video in question is a guided meditation session, as explicitly stated in the title, description, and tags such as \"guided meditation,\" \"meditation for anxiety,\" \"meditation for healing,\" and more. There is no mention of physical activity that would require any specific fitness equipment to perform the meditative exercises. \n\nThe description advises viewers to \"find a quiet space, put some headphones on, close your eyes, and enjoy,\" which further emphasizes that the session is meant to be enjoyed in a calm environment without the need for equipment. Meditation typically does not require physical props, and no specific equipment is listed or implied as necessary in any part of the metadata.\n\nAs such, the video appears to be solely focused on mental and emotional relaxation through guided meditation, suggesting that no physical equipment is needed beyond possibly a comfortable seat or quiet environment. Therefore, the required equipment list for this video is empty, indicating it is a bodyweight-only meditation experience."
