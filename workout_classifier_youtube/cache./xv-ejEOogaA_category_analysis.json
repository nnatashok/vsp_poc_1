  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as a 'Meditation' with a score of 1 because the title, description, and tags explicitly reference meditation repeatedly. The title 'A 10-Minute Journey to Inner Peace | Guided Meditation' clearly indicates a focus on guided meditation. The tags such as 'guided meditation', 'meditation guided', and 'inner peace meditation' reinforce this categorization. The channel, Great Meditation, specializes in meditation content, confirming the workout type. Comments from viewers also describe experiences typical of meditation practice, such as feelings of inner peace and self-acceptance, further supporting this classification. A secondary category of 'Breathing exercises' is suggested with a score of 0.2 due to the common association of breathing techniques as part of meditation routine, though this aspect is not explicitly mentioned in the provided metadata. The overall confidence in classification is very high (0.95) given the clear evidence from multiple metadata sources."
