  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as HIIT with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is evidenced by the repeated mention of 'Tabata', a well-known form of HIIT, in the title, description, and tags (e.g., '15 MIN TABATA AB Workout', 'tabata style workout'). The workout involves intervals of 20 seconds of activity followed by 10 seconds of rest, which is characteristic of HIIT.\n\nAdditionally, the video is classified under 'Mat' with a score of 0.6, as the workout is performed on a mat, indicated by phrases like 'all you need is your mat' in the description. Although the focus is on core exercises, which often involve some floor work, the emphasis remains primarily on intensity and intervals.\n\nThe 'Body weight' category is also relevant with a score of 0.7, as the workout calls for 'no equipment'. This indicates that exercises are performed with body weight only, fitting the description for body weight workouts. The lack of equipment and focus on core exercises supports this classification.\n\nOverall, the combination of HIIT, Mat, and Body weight categories accurately reflects the workout's focus and methodology, as corroborated by both the channel's content style and the user comments which frequently mention Tabata and core strength."
