  "vibesExplanation": "The video is best characterized by 'The Zen Flow' vibe, with a score of 0.9, as it focuses on grounding, intentional, and breath-centered meditation for habit change and new beginnings. The description emphasizes themes such as 'mindfulness meditation,' 'stress reduction,' and 'personal development,' which align with calming and intentional practice. The use of music, described as therapeutic, further supports this vibe. Additionally, the emotional comments indicate a significant impact on viewers, evoking feelings of transformation and emotional release, which are characteristic of a grounding experience. \n\nThe 'Deep Recharge' vibe scores 0.7 because the meditation is described as a 'powerful experience for new beginnings,' which implies a resetting and refreshing of the mind, similar to a nervous system reset. \n\nLastly, the 'Reboot Workout' vibe scores 0.6, reflecting the video's focus on 'letting go of negativity' and 'replacing old habits,' which suggests a low-stress, total-body refreshment mainly on a mental level. Given the strong focus on relaxation and emotional impact referenced in the comments, this vibe is also relevant, albeit slightly less so compared to the first two."
