  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified under 'Stretching' with a high confidence score of 1.0. This is based on explicit references in the title ('20 MIN LOWER BODY STRETCH for Recovery and Flexibility (Hamstrings, Butt, & Hips)'), description ('a quick routine that is focused mainly on the hips and hamstrings' and 'Perfect for recovery/sore muscles and working on your flexibility!'), and tags (e.g., 'stretch workout', 'lower body stretching', 'stretching exercises'). The emphasis on recovery and improving flexibility through stretching exercises strongly supports this categorization. \n\nA secondary classification is 'Yoga' with a score of 0.4. This is suggested by the use of the term 'yoga' in the tags ('lower body stretch yoga', 'lower body yoga stretch', 'lower body recovery yoga', 'lower body flexibility yoga') and the description. However, because the primary focus is on stretching rather than traditional yoga postures or sequences, the confidence and score for this category are lower.\n\nThe channel's overall focus on at-home workouts and real-time exercises corroborates the emphasis on stretching in the workout."
