    "I have been doing it daily since 2015. It rescued me from a nasty, disgusting and stinky mental state. A living hell!<br> I just wish that meditation was taken more seriously. This world would be a way better place. Bliss and Peace!",
    "I have been doing this for 60 days now. The mental chatter has reduced a lot. Long way to go, but definitely making progress. Please pray for me \ud83d\ude4f",
    "I have had asthma, COPD and other lung conditions my entire adult life; for more than fifty years. Focusing on my&quot;breath&quot; in meditation has been difficult for me. It&#39;s a trauma trigger. But today, as I listened to you, for the first time I discovered that focusing on the movement of my diaphragm instead of breathing was a safer, less traumatic way to focus and clear my mind. I know I am not the only person with lung and breathing problems who have this issue. I thought this insight might be of interest to you.",
    "I like how &quot;No Nonsense&quot; is super close to &quot;No Bullshit&quot; lol Thank you Jon, for your beautiful book &quot;Wherever You Go, There You Are&quot;. I just finished that today.",
    "I love the silence we are allowed."
