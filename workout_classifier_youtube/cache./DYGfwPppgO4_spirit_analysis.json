  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a very high confidence score of 0.95. This is based on several indicators in the metadata: the title emphasizes 'stress relief' and 'flexibility,' and the description notes 'calming' and 'light and easy' stretches designed for relaxation and stress reduction. The tags also re-emphasize terms like 'stress relief,' 'calming,' and 'relaxing,' which highlight the restorative nature of the workout. Additionally, the user comments indicate participants' emotional responses and physical relief, further supporting this classification.\n\nThe spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' is also applicable, with a score of 0.65. The workout's structure as a 'full body stretch routine' suggests a sequence of movements that could involve smooth transitions, aligning with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. The 'Minimal Talking' aspect hints at an experience where participants focus on the rhythm of movement without verbal interruptions. However, since the primary focus is on stress relief rather than fluid choreography, the score is lower than for the primary spirit."
