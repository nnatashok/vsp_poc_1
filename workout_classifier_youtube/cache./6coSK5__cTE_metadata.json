    "I&#39;ve been doing this workout and others from this channel for the past 2 weeks or so. Last week I was 229 lbs, this week I am down to 225.6 lbs!!!!!! I am motivated to continue my weight loss journey.<br>UPDATE: Wow, it&#39;s been a while since I updated on my weight loss, I&#39;ve also started on other videos from this channel, but now I am down to 221lbs!!! Over a month for a couple weeks, I was unable to work out due to a foot injury but I substituted that for a calorie deficit! I have now been working out again on and off again for the past two weeks which seems to be helping in preventing burn out. I&#39;ll try to update every so often!<br><br>UPDATE: LOL i forgot to update since elast year this is crazy but one year update you guys: I am now 190lbs, I worked out from last year May to August when I came home from College and will be doing the same thing again this summer!!! \ud83d\ude43 I have lost a total of 40lbs<br><br>Update 3: Hii Guys, just another update to share my progress, I am now 185Lbs \ud83d\ude0c<br><br>Update 4: been a while, I stopped using this video to exercise but coming back for winter break, I\u2019m now 173LBS  (December 2024)\ud83d\ude43",
