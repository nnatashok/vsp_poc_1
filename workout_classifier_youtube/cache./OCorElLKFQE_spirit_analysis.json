  "spiritsExplanation": "The dominant spirit of the workout is 'Soothing & Restorative.' This is evidenced by the focus on gratitude, meditation, and stress relief, as indicated by tags such as '5 minute meditation for gratitude,' 'gratitude meditation,' and 'stress relief.' The description emphasizes peaceful energy, breathing, and cultivating a positive perspective, all elements that align strongly with a soothing and restorative focus. User comments also highlight feelings of peace and emotional release, supporting a 1.0 score for this spirit.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm,' with a score of 0.6. The guidance of a meditation session, potential synchronization with breathing, and music credits suggest a rhythmic, continuous flow intrinsic to mindfulness practices. While not dominant, these elements contribute to its inclusion.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the lack of indicators for physical exertion or athletic skills. The channel's overall focus on mindfulness further supports the chosen spirits, reinforcing the restorative and rhythmic nature of the video."
