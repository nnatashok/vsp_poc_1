The absence of physical movement or complex coordination confirms a high confidence in identifying this as beginner level.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is mainly 'Beginner', supported by the meditation nature of the workout, which doesn't demand physical fitness or advanced technical skills. However, the presence of the term 'experienced meditation practices' in the description suggests that intermediate and advanced levels can also benefit from deeper meditation practice. Thus, these levels are included with lower scores to accommodate users who may have more meditation experience."
