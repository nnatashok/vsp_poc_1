  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is strongly indicated by the video's focus on stretching exercises aimed at improving flexibility and serving as a recovery routine after a workout. Keywords such as 'stretching exercises for beginners,' 'stretching after workout,' and 'feel so much better' from user comments emphasize the gentle and recuperative nature of this workout, justifying a high score of 0.9. Additionally, the video's 20-minute duration and lack of high-impact or intense movement promotes a low-intensity, restorative experience.\n\nThere is a secondary, less pronounced 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the continuous and smooth nature of stretching routines, which can also focus on the mind-body connection, as indicated by comments appreciating the feel-good nature of the workouts. This aspect supports a moderate alignment, with a score of 0.4.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined' are not evident due to the lack of intensity and specific exercise regimens. The activity is clearly meant for relaxation and flexibility and does not involve outdoor challenges or sports-specific training."
