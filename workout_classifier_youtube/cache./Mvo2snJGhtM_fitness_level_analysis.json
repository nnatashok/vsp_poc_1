  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises included, such as 'single leg body saw crunch' and 'lateral bears + kneel-to-squat,' suggest movements requiring some balance, coordination, and stability, thus placing them into the Intermediate range. However, modifications or variations may make some exercises accessible to beginners, like prisoner side-to-side squats being relatively simple. Additionally, the 'no impact' aspect makes it more beginner-friendly in terms of complexity.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 20-minute HIIT session consisting of exercises performed for 30 seconds with 30 seconds of rest, repeated four times. This format, especially with exercises labeled as 'fat burning' or 'intense,' supports a Challenging level due to its high energy expenditure. However, the inclusion of rest equal to work time and 'no impact' exercises do provide a somewhat less intense option for deconditioned users, suggesting a Moderate rating is possible for those who pace themselves or perform fewer rounds.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.82,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level leans towards Intermediate primarily due to the intermediate technique demands of exercises like 'single leg body saw crunch' and 'lateral bears with kneel-to-squat.' The 'no impact' approach and possible pacing modifications allow Beginners to participate by adapting the workout. Advanced users could intensify by increasing rounds or decreasing rest, thus meeting a broader fitness spectrum. Comments indicate users may not complete the workout fully, reinforcing an Intermediate level alignment, while also being accessible to Beginners."
