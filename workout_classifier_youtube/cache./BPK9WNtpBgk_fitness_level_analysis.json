  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is 22 minutes long, which is manageable for most beginners, aligning it with light effort difficulty. The focus on stretching, breathing, and feeling good implies low-energy expenditure activities. The description and user feedback highlight emotional and physical wellness rather than intense physical challenges, reaffirming a light effort level primarily. However, sustained yoga poses could also present a moderate effort for some deconditioned users, justifying a moderate-level classification at a lower score.",

The practice duration and light effort required mean even deconditioned users can participate, with a focus on personal exploration rather than intensity. The intermediate score reflects that some familiarity with yoga or exercise would enhance the experience, while advanced users may appreciate the self-awareness aspects but find it less physically challenging, thus a lower advanced score."
