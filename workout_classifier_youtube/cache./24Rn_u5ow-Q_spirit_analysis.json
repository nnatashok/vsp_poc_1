  "spiritsExplanation": "This workout is classified primarily as 'Soothing & Restorative' with extremely high confidence due to explicit indicators in both the video title, description, and user comments. The title 'Deep Relaxation in 7 Minutes' and phrases like 'induce deep relaxation,' 'calm your mind,' 'bring you into a deep state of relaxation,' and 'leave you deeply relaxed and at peace' emphasize the soothing and restorative nature. The entire setup\u2014including the 'mysterious land within a circle of wisdom stones' and 'under the star-filled night sky'\u2014conveys tranquility and peace, typical of restorative sessions. User comments further highlight the relaxation effect ('this guided meditation really helped me find a peaceful sanctuary within myself,' 'Wow, this guided meditation really helped me find a peaceful sanctuary within myself'). The channel's focus on guided sleep meditations and relaxation content further supports this classification. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are clearly irrelevant here due to the absence of intensity or sports-specific indicators."
