  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is titled '10 Minute Yoga For Beginners ( EASY Morning Stretches )', explicitly indicating that the primary focus is on yoga, specifically tailored for beginners and involving stretches. This is reinforced by multiple instances of the term 'yoga' and 'stretch' both in the title and description. Tags also heavily feature 'yoga', including '10 minute yoga for beginners,' 'morning yoga,' and 'yoga for back pain,' suggesting a clear focus on yoga practices, hence a score of 0.9 for Yoga. \n\nThe description further supports this by mentioning 'easy morning stretches for back pain relief,' indicating a secondary focus on stretching to enhance flexibility and alleviate pain. Phrases such as 'stretching the body,' 'stretching the back,' as well as the inclusion of 'morning stretches' in the tags justify assigning a score of 0.6 for Stretching as it is an integral, yet secondary aspect of the routine. The overall confidence level is very high because the channel's theme and content focus strongly align with yoga and stretching practices, as evident from the views, likes, and channel description."
