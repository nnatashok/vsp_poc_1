  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Full Body Stretch | Mobility Routine for Flexibility & Relaxation' strongly aligns with the Soothing & Restorative spirit, evidenced by keywords such as 'stretch', 'mobility', 'relaxation', 'recovery', and 'calming' found in both the tags and description. The emphasis on flexibility and relaxation, coupled with comments noting how the workout provides a calming effect and is suitable after other intense exercises, further reinforces this classification. This spirit received a high score of 0.9 due to the explicit focus on restorative and gentle movements.\n\nAdditionally, the Flow & Rhythm spirit is relevant, with a score of 0.7. Evidence includes comments praising the smooth transitions and flow of the workout, the structure that eliminates the need to look at the screen constantly, and the presence of music that accompanies the routine, which suggests a rhythmic aspect to the exercise. The 'smooth' and 'flowing' description in comments supports the presence of this spirit.\n\nOther spirits like High-Energy & Intense or Sport & Agility were excluded as the routine's focus on gentle, flowing stretching does not align with high-intensity or athletic training."
