  "spiritsExplanation": "The video titled 'Flow - Day 20 - Inward' from 'Yoga With Adriene' heavily indicates a focus on 'Flow & Rhythm' due to explicit use of the term 'Flow' and the emphasis on a continuous journey inwards, suggesting smooth, coordinated postures typical of flow yoga. The description speaks of adding new vocabulary to the practice, indicative of a structured sequence that promotes rhythmic flow. The high score of 0.9 for this spirit is supported by the repeated inclusion in the title and tags such as 'home yoga practice' and '30 Day yoga challenge', which emphasize a consistent practice flow. \n\nAdditionally, 'Soothing & Restorative' is appropriate given the gentle and inward reflective nature described. The comments reflect personal emotional journeys during practice, suggesting restorative effects. Phrases like 'breathe', 'beautiful way to start, or end, the day', and expressions of emotional release align with a calming, restorative practice. Hence, this spirit receives a score of 0.7. \n\nOther spirits were excluded due to lack of emphasis on intense physical activity, technical discipline, outdoor environment, or athletic skills in the metadata."
