  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video features a yoga session focused on upper back stretches, designed to relieve pain and tension, which typically involves simple movements common in yoga practices. The tags 'yoga for beginners' and 'beginners yoga' along with channel's inclusivity for all levels suggest basic techniques predominantly, with some potential intermediate elements given the need for focus on posture and alignment typical in yoga.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video duration is 23 minutes, which can slightly increase demand but remains in a range manageable for beginners. Yoga, particularly for back pain, tends to be gentle and low-impact, focusing more on stretching and breathing rather than cardiovascular or high-energy expenditure. 'Take time for yourself to breathe deep' and focus on 'relieving tension' signals a light to moderate effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the beginner-friendly approach of 'Yoga for Back Pain', it provides accessibility for destressed and deconditioned individuals, aligning with Beginner fitness needs. However, flexibility, awareness, and consistency needed in yoga add a moderate alignment with intermediate levels. The video's duration also supports potential intermediate inclusion as it introduces a slight increase in endurance capacity."
