    "I was on the cusp of a SERIOUS Anxiety attack. My chest was tight! My breaths were short. My mind was racing bad! Head felt like it was going to explode \ud83e\udd2f and I was going to lose it!!! I did this meditation, and it all went away! It felt like I traveled out of my body, and then returned after the count down! I\u2019ve been through LOTS of trauma! And at 33 years of age! I\u2019m BEYOND tired of carrying it!!! I thank you for this channel, and will continue using these meditations, for years to come!",

Believe that, feel that, and allow that \u2764\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe",
    "I struggle with major anxiety and lately it\u2019s prevented me from being able to calm my mind enough to sleep. I\u2019d wake up thinking I was having a heart attack. I grabbed my phone one night and searched YouTube for a meditation, thinking there was no way it would work. It\u2019s been a week and I\u2019ve fallen asleep before making it to the 10 minute mark. It has been life changing. Thank you so much for giving ppl like me an option to reach for in dark moments.",
    "Very nice video description and music \u2764 thank you. I choose your video more than others.",
    "This was my first time meditating, and it was unbelievable. I turned to complete mush. Even though I have ADD, I had no problem becoming attuned to this beautiful, relaxing, and beautiful voice. Now, I find myself coming back to this session over, and over again. Thank you so much."
