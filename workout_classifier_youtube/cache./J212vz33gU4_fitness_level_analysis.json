  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout features a variety of high-intensity strength and cardio movements, which typically involve bodyweight exercises. These exercises usually require some coordination but are not overly complex. The presence of terms like 'no equipment' and a 40-second on, 15-second rest interval suggests accessible exercises with moderate complexity. Therefore, both beginner and intermediate technique difficulty levels are appropriate based on the movement descriptions and the goal of making the workout accessible to all fitness levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'intense' and aims to burn around 300 calories in 15 minutes, which indicates a high energy expenditure within a short duration. The interval structure (40s on, 15s rest) also supports a challenging effort level for less fit users, making the workout suitable for those who can withstand moderate to high cardiovascular and muscular stress, typical of HIIT sessions. Comments describe it as taxing, reinforcing the challenging classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The primary audience includes both those starting their fitness journey and individuals seeking to maintain their fitness. Beginner and intermediate levels are appropriate due to the bodyweight nature, duration, and intensity variations described. Advanced users might find the continuous challenge rewarding, corroborated by comments from older yet fit individuals and those with significant weight loss results. Hence, a wide range of fitness levels can find this workout suitable, but beginners should approach with caution."
