  "description": "LOWER BELLY BURNER! \nAll standing\nLow Impact\nNo Equipment\nBeginner Friendly\nWorkout At Home in a Small Space!\n\nMake sure to have lots of water with you during this workout, it will challenge you to new levels!\n\nIf you are used to working out with me, you are used to a 40s exercise time and 20s \"rest\" of walking. In todays video we will be doing 30s exercise (pushing it to the LIMIT) then 10 seconds rest. This means that you have less time to recover, which will help you burn more fat during the workout and afterwards!\n\nIf any of the moves are too fast or too challenging for you just go back to a walk. Our goal is to keep our heart rate elevated so that the burn is at its MAX!\n\nMake sure to have a healthy nutrition plan to support this workout routine! And make sure not to overeat to overcompensate for the calories burned. Calories burned is just a reference for you to see how much energy you used to do the workout!\n\nApple Watch Setting: Indoor Walk\nCalories Burned: 235\nIntensity Level: 9/10\n\n0:00 INTRO\n1:28 WORKOUT\n29:57  NUTRITION HELP & TIPS\n\n\nShare this workout with a FRIEND!! \n\n\nKEEP UP WITH ME\n\nINSTAGRAM \u2192 https://www.instagram.com/growwithjo/?hl=en\nFACEBOOK \u2192 https://www.facebook.com/growwithjoofficial/\nPINTEREST \u2192 https://www.pinterest.ca/growwithjo/\nCONTACT EMAIL \u2192 mgmt@growwithjo.com\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDISCLAIMER:\nAll information provided by growwithjo is of a general nature and is furnished only for educational/entertainment purposes only.

    "One of the reasons I love you so much is you don&#39;t push burpees on people. I HATE burpees. And for a very long time, they were like a main dish in the training world. Another reason I love you- and your workouts- is: I AM HAVING FUN. Who knew? Thank you for all you do. My body is changing and getting stronger without me hating the process.",
    "I&#39;ve been training with you for a month now and I have to show off the results! <br>I have lost 5 kg and 8 cm in the waist and I am very proud of myself. I also started eating healthier and drinking plenty of water. I eat a lot of protein and I haven&#39;t given up on what I like to eat and it feels sooooooo good! <br>Thank you Jo for inspiring me to lead a healthier life! &lt;3",
