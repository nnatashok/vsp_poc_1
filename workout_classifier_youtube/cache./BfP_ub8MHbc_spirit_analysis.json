  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout classified here is largely aligned with the 'Soothing & Restorative' and 'Flow & Rhythm' spirits. The video title '5 Minute Full Body Yoga | QUICK & EASY' and the description emphasize a short, simple practice that encourages listening to your body and modifying as needed, underscoring a restorative and gentle nature. User comments reflect personal relief and appreciation for the video's calming and motivating qualities during stressful times, pointing to a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, hence its high score of 0.85.\n\nMoreover, the mention of yoga and the channel's focus on varying yoga practices, including Vinyasa, suggest a steady, flowing sequence, supporting a 'Flow & Rhythm' classification with a score of 0.7. The recurring theme of ease and simplicity reflects this spirit as well. The structured nature of yoga itself could align with 'Structured & Disciplined,' but there's a stronger focus on the ease and relaxation aspects, reducing its presence. The absence of high intensity, outdoor elements, or sport-specific training excludes other spirits."
