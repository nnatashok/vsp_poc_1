    "I noticed how out of shape I am \ud83d\ude05I was shaking everywhere. I will continue doing these work outs for a month straight. 2025! Let\u2019s go. 4 months until summer",
    "This was so good but i took so many breaks. Today was so hard for some reason. I had no motivation and no strength.",
    "Hi Rachel! I just wanted to say how much I\u2019ve been enjoying your workouts! They really feel like true Pilates, not just another basic ab workout that\u2019s labeled as Pilates. I love the attention to detail and the full-body focus.<br><br>I have a question: Do you think doing the workout once a day, 4-5 times a week (with a calorie deficit and nutrition in check), would be effective for seeing results? Or would it be better to do it multiple times a day for better progress? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts! \ud83d\ude0a",
