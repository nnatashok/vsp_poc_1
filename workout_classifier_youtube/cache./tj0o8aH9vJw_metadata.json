    "I am a 71 yr. old woman who works out at home everyday. I don&#39;t think, act, look, or dress &quot;old lady&quot;. NO wimpy weights, NO &#39;senior moves&#39;! I just found you and am working out with you every day now! Yay! Competed this workout with 10 and 12 pound dumbbells. (Working my way up to somwe heavier)! Thanks so much!",
    "I am a 70 year old woman!  Tending to a disabled son and blind husband.  I try to workout 10 minutes a day (haha lucky if I make 3 days a week) but mainly to keep my posture, which I believe is so important, and to get my blood going a bit in the right way.  The rest of the activities I do keep me in motion pretty good.  I appreciate such fine exercise programs such as yours; thank you much.",
