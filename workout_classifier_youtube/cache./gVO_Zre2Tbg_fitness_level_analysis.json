  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves basic arm exercises using dumbbells targeting the triceps, biceps, and shoulders. The channel's focus on beginners and seniors suggests simple, uncomplicated exercises, supported by comments from older individuals successfully performing the workout. Techniques like bicep curls and tricep extensions generally require minimal coordination, alignment with 'Beginner' rating. Occasional referencing to making adjustments with weights allows for some 'Intermediate' exploration, but primarily validates 'Beginner' focus.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "At 11 minutes, the workout duration is short and likely does not require significant endurance, indicating a 'Light' effort level. The mention of 'challenging but do-able' for beginners and seniors implies manageable intensity. User feedback describes feeling 'burn' rather than extreme fatigue, supporting a 'Light' score. Adjustments with dumbbell weights could slightly elevate effort to 'Moderate,' but overall, the workout suits a light energy expenditure classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout's technique demands align well with a 'Beginner' fitness level due to its simplicity and low-coordination requirements. The short duration and user commentary focusing on older demographics accomplishing the workout suggest it is easily accessible to beginners. The allowance for different dumbbell weights introduces a 'self-adjustment' factor, hinting at an 'Intermediate' level for those using heavier weights. However, the primary audience and content positioning keep it squarely fitting well within beginner parameters, effectively matching the proposed technique and effort categorizations."
