  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit of this video is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a very high confidence score of 0.9. This is due to the focus on breathing exercises as a form of healing and relaxation, which is a fundamental aspect of recovery and stress reduction. The description emphasizes a safe and gradual practice, aligning with a restorative emphasis. Additionally, the soothing background music mentioned in the description supports this classification. \n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.7. This comes from the guided nature of the exercise, which involves following the rhythm of an expanding and contracting bubble to regulate breathing. This method promotes a smooth and continuous flow, enhancing mind-body connection through rhythm.\n\nOther potential spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined,' were not selected because the workout focuses more on relaxation, rhythm, and gentle pacing rather than intense effort or highly structured routines."
