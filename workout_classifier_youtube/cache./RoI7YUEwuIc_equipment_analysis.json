  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title \"TRUE Beginner Calisthenics Workout No Equipment | Follow Along 15 Minutes\" clearly indicates that no equipment is required for this workout, as it is a beginner calisthenics routine focusing on bodyweight exercises. The description further supports this by specifying \"no equipment, at home.\" Tags like \"calisthenics no equipment beginner\" and \"body weight at home workout\" reinforce that the exercises are designed to be done without any additional gear.\n\nAdditionally, the comments from viewers emphasize the accessibility of the workout and the absence of any mention of equipment usage. The lack of any indication of requiring equipment in the title, description, tags, or comments leads to a very high confidence level that this workout is indeed bodyweight only, requiring no equipment. Therefore, the required equipment list is empty."
