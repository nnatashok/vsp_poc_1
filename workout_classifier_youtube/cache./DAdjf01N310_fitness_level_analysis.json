  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout appears to focus on Pilates, which typically includes controlled, precise movements. The use of terms like 'natural' and 'like dancing' implies fluid and perhaps some coordinated movements, though not necessarily complex. The class is described as 'harmonious,' suggesting smooth transitions. Overall, Pilates requires some technique, which can be manageable for beginners but likely fits best for those at an intermediate level. Comments also suggest the workout feels natural and flowing, reinforcing the intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "At 19:46, the workout is designed to energize and strengthen without high intensity. Pilates is known for being challenging yet not as intensive as cardio or HIIT. The description and comments suggest it energizes and tones, consistent with moderate effort. A comment mentions using it as an alternative to high-intensity workouts, suggesting moderate physical demand. The phrase 'makes me sweat' indicates a moderate effort level, though not extreme.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique seems suitable for beginners but more appropriate for intermediate fitness levels due to the challenge of Pilates movements. The effort is moderate, appropriate for beginners and intermediates. Given the channel's emphasis on adaptable, feel-good movement, the workout likely appeals to a broad range of users. The Pilates nature might skew toward those with some fitness background (intermediate) but the manageable effort allows for beginners, especially those seeking a low-intensity entry. Advanced scores higher due to the technique needed for optimal results."
