  "categoriesExplanation": "The video primarily discusses 'Treadmill settings for fasted cardio,' as explicitly stated in both the title and the description, indicating that the workout occurs on a treadmill. The tags like 'treadmill settings for fat loss' reinforce this point, leading to a high confidence of 0.9 for the 'Treadmill' category. Moreover, the repetitive emphasis on 'walking' both in the description ('How much walking will you need to lose body fat?') and the tags ('walking to 10% body fat') suggests that the treadmill routine is focused on a walking pace rather than running. Comments further support this by mentioning speeds typical of walking. Consequently, the 'Walking' category also applies, but with a slightly lower confidence of 0.7 because while it's a major focus, it's secondary to the treadmill context. The focus on fat loss and a specific routine for setting treadmill metrics distances it from high-intensity categories like HIIT."
