  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly described as a \"40 MIN KILLER HIIT WORKOUT - Full Body, No Equipment\" in both the video title and the tags. Additionally, the description clearly states \"Equipment: No,\" reinforcing the bodyweight-only nature of the session. While a mat is mentioned in the description as something to 'grab', the context suggests it's more for comfort during floor exercises rather than a requirement, as the focus is on no equipment being needed for the workout itself. Therefore, based on the available metadata, this workout appears to be designed to be completed with bodyweight exercises alone, requiring no additional equipment."
