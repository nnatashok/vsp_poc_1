  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is primarily identified as 'The Firestarter' due to its short duration (10 minutes) and HIIT nature, which typically involves fast-paced, intense bursts, as evident from the '30s/20s Intervals' in the title. This aligns with the Firestarter vibe's focus on explosive and short workouts, earning a score of 0.7. Additionally, 'The Groove Session' vibe is considered with a score of 0.6, given the emphasis on fun and easy-to-follow movements suitable for kids and families, promoting a lively energy. The lack of structured music and inclusion of timer beeps for personal music choice somewhat supports this. Lastly, 'The Endorphin Wave' is assigned a score of 0.5 due to the workout's cardio nature and aim to energize, fitting within the endorphin-boosting effects typically associated with cardio routines. The absence of specific motivational coaching or intense competition vibes excluded the Warrior Workout and other high-intensity or structured vibes."
