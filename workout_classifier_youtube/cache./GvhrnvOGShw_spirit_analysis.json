  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Ultimate 20 Minute Elliptical Workout' is classified primarily under 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.8. The metadata explicitly describes the workout as 'intense,' emphasizing 'maximum effort,' 'speed,' and 'resistance,' all indicative of a high-energy, cardiovascular session aimed at pushing limits and burning calories. The workout blocks with varying levels of resistance and RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) further reinforce the high-intensity aspect.\n\nThe workout also embodies a 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit, scoring 0.7, as it follows a detailed and progressive protocol. The workout is broken into specific blocks (Warm-Up, Speed Block, Resistance Block, Max Effort Block, Cool Down) with precise instructions on duration and resistance levels. This methodical approach combined with guidance from a trainer contributes to a disciplined execution.\n\nOther spirits like 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' are excluded due to a lack of elements focusing on recovery/relaxation or outdoor challenges, respectively. The channel's emphasis on fitness accessibility further supports the structured and intense classification."
