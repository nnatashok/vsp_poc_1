  "vibesExplanation": "The video is classified as \"The Zen Flow\" because it is a short, guided meditation focused on grounding and connecting with inner peace during stressful times, indicating a slow-paced, intentional, and breath-centered experience typical of this vibe. The mention of letting go of negativity and stress, reconnecting with the inner self, and cleansing and healing from the inside out are strong indicators supporting this classification. This selection has a score of 0.9 due to these clear indicators in the description and title.\n\nSecondly, \"The Deep Recharge\" is applicable because the workout's aim to relieve anxiety and stress and bring positivity aligns with the ultra-gentle, nervous system reset qualities of this vibe. The use of phrases like \"relieve anxiety and stress\" and \"meditative journey\" suggests a focus on deep relaxation. This vibe is scored at 0.8 as it very strongly matches the described benefits, although it's slightly less explicit than the \"The Zen Flow.\" The tags and description provide strong evidence for these classifications, with very high confidence."
