  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The description explicitly mentions that no equipment is needed for the workout. However, it suggests using 'a soft surface like a yoga mat or towel' for comfort during the stretching routine. Thus, a 'Mat' is likely used for floor exercises and to provide a comfortable surface, indicating a high confidence level of 0.8. The title also aligns with typical mat usage, as it includes 'a full body routine for tight muscles, flexibility & mobility,' suggesting floor-based stretching exercises that benefit from a mat."
