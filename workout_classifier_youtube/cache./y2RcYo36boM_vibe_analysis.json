  "vibesExplanation": "The '20 MIN EXPRESS PILATES WORKOUT' from Move With Nicole exhibits characteristics that align with both 'The Meditative Grind' and 'The Masterclass Workout' vibes. The 'Meditative Grind' is evident due to the repetitive and methodical nature of Pilates, which encourages participants to zone in on their form and breathing. The video is described as an 'Express Pilates class perfect for when you are short on time but want to feel energised,' suggesting a focus on consistent movement and mindfulness. User comments about feeling mentally better point to a meditative, restorative element. \n\nAdditionally, the 'Masterclass Workout' vibe is supported by Nicole's background as a certified instructor and the emphasis on technique as Pilates involves precise, controlled movements that are skill-intensive, fitting the 'Technique-driven, focused' vibe. The video aims at a 'Beginner to Moderate' level, indicating a focus on skill-building and improvement, solidifying its match to this vibe. The decision not to select more intense workout vibes stems from the workout's moderate intensity and lack of high-energy elements typical in more explosive or aggressive workout vibes."
