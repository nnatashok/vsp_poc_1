  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout revolves around using an elliptical climber machine, which is generally simple to operate with basic foot placement and arm mechanics. However, the use of high resistance and intervals introduces a moderate level of complexity, leaning slightly towards intermediate due to coordination in maintaining form with varied resistance levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'high resistance' and involves pyramid intervals, requiring sustained effort over the 25-minute duration with resistance variations. This suggests moderate to challenging energy expenditure. The repeated cycles and short rest periods (2 minutes recovery) contribute to a challenging level especially for deconditioned users, though the presence of recovery segments moderates the overall intensity.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the elliptical climber's inherent simplicity and the intermediate classification by the trainer, the workout aligns primarily with both beginner and intermediate levels. However, the high resistance and pyramid interval format impose enough demand to slightly involve an advanced level, especially for those unaccustomed to sustained cardio work. The workout duration also aligns with a more intermediate level due to it being over 20 minutes, requiring a solid baseline of cardiovascular endurance."
