  "vibesExplanation": "The predominant vibe of this workout video is 'The Zen Flow' due to the focus on guided meditation designed to bring about a sense of calm, focus, and reconnection with one's inner fire, as explicitly mentioned in the title and description. The use of phrases such as 'manifest success,' 'reconnect to your truth,' and 'conscious stillness' aligns strongly with the intentions of 'The Zen Flow' vibe, scoring a high 0.9. Additionally, the emphasis on meditation for 'uncertain times' suggests a grounding, breath-centered approach, typical of this vibe. \n\n'\"The Deep Recharge\"' is also relevant, as the practice is intended to provide a mental reset and stress relief, which fits within the realm of nervous system resets and ultra-gentle movement, scoring 0.7. The tags include 'meditation for sleep,' further supporting this vibe as these sessions generally aim to lower stress and prepare the mind for rest, although the primary focus remains on empowerment and manifestation, justifying the secondary score.\n\nOther vibes such as 'The Endorphin Wave' or 'The Reboot Workout' were considered but excluded since the video does not focus on physical exertion or stretching, which are typical characteristics of those vibes."
