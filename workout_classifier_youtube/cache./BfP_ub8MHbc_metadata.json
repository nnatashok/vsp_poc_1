If you feel pain or extreme discomfort, do not do the yoga pose, movement, or stretch and come to something that is accessible & comfortable for you. Always consult your doctor about any physical activity.\n\nBlack Yogi Nico Marie/Yoga with Nico recommends that you consult your physician regarding the applicability of any recommendations and follow all safety instructions before beginning any exercise program, including yoga. When online, it is up to the individual to assess whether they are ready for the class that they have chosen. When participating in any exercise or exercise program, there is the possibility of physical injury. If you engage in this exercise or exercise program, you agree that you do so at your own risk, are voluntarily participating in these activities, assume all risk of injury to yourself.

Meditation can, however, be a component of an overall treatment plan, when monitored by a healthcare professional.\n\nAll opinions in this video are my own and not sponsored by any company.
