  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Indoor biking' with a score of 1.0, due to the clear emphasis on cycling in the title ('METABOLIC BOOSTING cycling workout'), channel name ('Kaleigh Cohen Cycling'), and throughout the description, which details a cycling workout with RPM recommendations and resistance levels. This makes 'Indoor biking' the central defining characteristic of the workout. Additionally, the description suggests varying intensity levels ('low-intensity ride' and 'high-intensity push'), which indicates the presence of high-intensity interval training elements, justifying the inclusion of the 'HIIT' category. However, since the primary focus remains on cycling, 'HIIT' is assigned a slightly lower score of 0.7."
