  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified is 'The Zen Flow', given this workout's focus on a slow and gentle yoga practice. The use of phrases like 'gentle flow', 'ease into your practice', and 'settle into your body' clearly suggests a grounding and intentional experience, which aligns perfectly with the 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The intention to build a 'strong foundation' and use of props for alignment further indicate a careful and mindful approach. The score of 0.9 reflects very high confidence, as these elements are central to the workout's design.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Reboot Workout' vibe is also relevant, as the practice's emphasis on relaxation and stress-ease (seen in tags like 'yoga for relaxation') fits well with a refreshing and low-stress routine designed to rejuvenate. The description's focus on 'relaxing routine' earns it a 0.7 score for its alignment with the 'Reboot' properties.\n\nOther vibes, such as those involving higher intensity or competition, were excluded based on the clear focus on relaxation and foundational techniques, with no indication of fast-paced or strenuous activity."
