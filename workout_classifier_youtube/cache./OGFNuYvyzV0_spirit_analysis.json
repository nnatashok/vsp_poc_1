  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this video is 'Soothing & Restorative'. The title, 'Yoga for Vertigo', and description emphasize a gentle session designed to calm the parasympathetic nervous system, highlighting recovery and relaxation. Phrases like 'relaxing practice', 'healing in yoga', and 'take it slow' strongly indicate a restorative focus. The aim to support those with vertigo, anxiety, TBI, or glaucoma further supports this classification. The high view count and likes suggest a wide appreciation for its calming qualities. \"Soothing & Restorative\" receives a score of 0.9 due to these explicit cues.\n\nA secondary, lesser spirit could be 'Flow & Rhythm', rated at 0.4. While the session might express a rhythmical element through pranayama (breathing exercises) and consistent movement, the main emphasis remains on calming and healing practices rather than continuous flow or coordination, justifying a lower score. The channel's mission and community comments about taking time for oneself support a gentle, mindful approach, reinforcing the primary spirit choice."
