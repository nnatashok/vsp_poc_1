  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified primarily under 'Meditation' with a full score of 1. This is explicitly indicated by both the title \"A Ten Minute Guided Meditation to Clear Your Mind\" and the repeated mentions of meditation-based tags such as \"guided meditation,\" \"clear your mind meditation,\" and similar phrases. The channel itself, 'Great Meditation,' is dedicated to producing meditation content, evident from both the channel description and video description, which emphasize leading listeners into a peaceful meditative state. \n\nA secondary category is 'Breathing exercises,' assigned a score of 0.5. While the primary focus is meditation, the description mentions \"placing your attention on your breath,\" which is a core component of breathing exercises, potentially integrating this aspect into the meditation practice. However, since the emphasis remains strongly on meditation, the score is moderate. The high view count and supportive comments reflect the video\u2019s success in delivering its meditation-focused content."
