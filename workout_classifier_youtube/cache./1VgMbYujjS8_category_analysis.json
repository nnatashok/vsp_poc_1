  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under 'Meditation' with a score of 1.0. This is evident from the consistent use of the word 'meditation' in the title, description, tags, and channel information. The description highlights guided meditation and mindfulness practices specifically designed for new beginnings and habit change, which are strong indicators of meditation content. The channel itself is focused on meditation and mindful practices, reinforcing this classification.\n\nAdditionally, 'Breathing exercises' are somewhat relevant with a score of 0.6. The tags include 'breathing,' and the mention of 'mindfulness meditation' and 'relaxation' in the description suggests the inclusion of breathing techniques as part of the meditation process. However, the primary focus remains on meditation, which is why it is the dominant category."
