  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is classified as having a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a score of 0.8 due to its focus on a 'simple and gentle' yoga practice for beginners as indicated in the title and description. The use of terms like 'gentle,' 'simple,' and 'full body practice' emphasize a calming and restorative experience suitable for beginners, aligning with the spirit's characteristics. The high confidence level is backed by the channel's focus on accessibility and offering yoga without props, which supports relaxation and reducing stress. \n\nAdditionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is assigned a score of 0.6, as the practice involves a 'beginner yoga flow,' highlighting a sequence of movements, which is rhythm-focused. The tags such as 'beginner yoga flow' and 'easy yoga flow,' along with user comments describing a 'gentle slow flow,' reinforce this aspect. Though the flow is not intense, the element of continuously moving poses supports this secondary spirit. Other spirits were excluded due to lack of focus on intensity, athleticism, structure, or outdoor environment."
