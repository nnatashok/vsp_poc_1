  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.9 due to the emphasis on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) as noted in the title, tags, and description. Phrases such as 'full body HIIT workout' and '4-Minute AMRAP Finisher' along with comments about high heart rates and tough repeat cycles support this categorization. The presence of timed intervals of work and rest, mention of '40 seconds of work, followed by 20 seconds of rest,' and intense exercises like 'Dumbbell Burpee Deadlift' and 'Lateral Shuffles' indicate a fast-paced, high-effort session designed to push limits, which aligns with the High-Energy & Intense spirit.\n\nSecondly, the workout embodies the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a score of 0.7. The detailed structure of the workout, including a 9-exercise routine repeated twice, indicates a well-organized and methodical approach. Furthermore, the inclusion of equipment details, specific intervals, and a progression from warm-up to workout and cool down all emphasize discipline and structure in the workout routine. The explicit instructions and workout calendar program reinforce this classification. \n\nOther spirits like 'Sport & Agility' were considered but scored lower due to a lack of sports-specific movements or agility drills. 'Flow & Rhythm' was excluded as the emphasis is more on intensity than fluidity of movement."
