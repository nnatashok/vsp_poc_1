  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is assessed as Beginner to Intermediate. The workout primarily features simple, straightforward exercises as indicated by the mention of chair workouts and the focus on senior and beginner audiences. This suggests movements requiring minimal coordination. However, the presence of standing exercises at an intermediate level offers a slight increase in complexity, justifying the inclusion of the Intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as Light to Moderate. The workout is 27 minutes long, which leans towards being more demanding than very short workouts. It involves HIIT principles with interval variations (20, 30, and 40 seconds), suggesting a moderate challenge. Yet, the use of chair exercises primarily suitable for seniors indicates lower energy expenditure, supporting the Light classification. User comments emphasize that it's achievable despite deconditioned states, aligning with both Light and Moderate effort levels.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily Beginner but also includes Intermediate. Key indicators include the workout's adjustability for both seated and standing positions and its categorization as suitable for seniors and beginners. The workout's duration of 27 minutes and interval structure pushes the envelope slightly beyond pure beginner, thus incorporating Intermediate for those who might want to attempt the more physically demanding standing variations."
