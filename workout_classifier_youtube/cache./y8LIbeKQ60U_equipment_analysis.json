  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a guided sleep meditation focusing on chakra alignment, as indicated by the title and tags. Meditation sessions typically do not involve physical exercise equipment but may be performed on a comfortable mat to facilitate relaxation. However, there is no explicit mention or implication of a mat or any other equipment in the title, description, comments, or tags. The content is audio-based and meant for listening to while resting or before sleep, which further suggests that no physical equipment is necessary to engage with this meditation. Therefore, the workout is classified as requiring no equipment, focusing purely on guided meditation for relaxation and sleep."
