  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is explicitly described as a 'Guided Meditation to Reduce Anxiety,' which strongly indicates that the primary activity is meditation. The description emphasizes focusing on mental presence, calmness, and the reduction of anxiety, which are key aspects of meditation practices. The channel, 'MindfulPeace,' specializes in meditation content aimed at promoting mindfulness and inner peace. The comments also support this classification, as viewers describe reduced stress and anxiety after participating in the meditation. Given the strong alignment with meditation, this category is assigned a score of 0.95 for being the central feature of the video. \n\nNo other categories were suitable as the video does not involve physical exercises, breathing techniques, or any other mind-body activities beyond meditation. The evidence consistently pointed to a focus on mental relaxation and mindfulness practices."
