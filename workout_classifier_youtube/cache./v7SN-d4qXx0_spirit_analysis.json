  "spiritsExplanation": "The dominant spirit of this workout video is 'Soothing & Restorative,' with high confidence. This is due to several explicit signals throughout the metadata. The title 'Bedtime Yoga' and the description emphasize this yoga practice as a 'gentle' tool for alleviating 'stress, anxiety, or tension.' The tags such as 'relaxing yoga,' 'yoga for relaxation,' 'healing yoga,' and 'yoga for sleep' further reinforce the soothing nature of this session. The video's purpose is clearly articulated as a remedy for imbalance and to aid restful sleep, which aligns perfectly with restorative qualities. Comments from users add real-life validation, describing improvements in sleep and reduced tension, reinforcing the session's calming and restorative purpose. The structured aspects of yoga are present but secondary, as the primary focus remains on relaxation and healing benefits, which excludes other spirits."
