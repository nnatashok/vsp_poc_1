  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video focuses on guided breathwork, which is predominantly a beginner-friendly technique due to its simplicity and minimal physical coordination requirements. The description explicitly mentions it as suitable for beginners, and the tags include 'beginners yoga.' However, certain elements like integrating breath with relaxation or stress management can introduce a minor intermediate element, particularly for users unfamiliar with mindful breathing practices.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is a breathwork routine, inherently low in physical exertion. Terms like 'calm,' 'anxiety-free,' and focus on mental clarity suggest a low energy demand. The session's 17-minute duration also supports a light effort classification, as breathwork does not impose significant cardiovascular or muscular stress.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily beginner, consistent with the technique and effort difficulty. The metadata supports this with tags such as 'beginners yoga' and phrases like 'guided to reduce stress,' indicating accessibility for beginners. Intermediate level is marginally applicable for users who may need to develop mindfulness in their routine or who seek initial integration of breathwork practices into their lifestyle. The effort remains light, making it accessible to those with limited fitness experience."
