  "spiritsExplanation": "The video '15 Min. Full Body Stretch | Daily Routine for Flexibility, Mobility & Relaxation | DAY 7' strongly embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to its emphasis on relaxation, recovery, and mental well-being, as highlighted in the description and title. Phrases like 'Daily Routine for Flexibility, Mobility & Relaxation,' 'Erholung & Recovery,' and 'Entspannung' suggest a focus on gentle, restorative exercise. The absence of voice-over further encourages a personal, mindful approach, aligning with restorative practices. A high score of 0.9 reflects the video\u2019s explicit focus on gentle stretching and mental relaxation components, corroborated by the emphasis on observing thoughts and encouraging mindfulness. 'Flow & Rhythm' scores 0.6 as the video involves continuous stretching movements and uses a music playlist to maintain a consistent rhythm throughout. This aligns with music-driven pacing and some level of smooth movement, typical of 'Flow & Rhythm.'. The structured approach of timing each stretch with a \"beep\" enhances focus and rhythm, supporting the secondary classification. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the low-intensity, non-athletic nature of the workout."
