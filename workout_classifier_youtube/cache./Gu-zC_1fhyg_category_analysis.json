  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily focused on stretching exercises to improve flexibility, as clearly indicated by the title '15 min Full Body Stretch | Daily Routine for Flexibility & Relaxation' and reinforced by tags like 'full body stretch', 'stretches for flexibility', and 'stretching routine'. Additionally, the description emphasizes a 'relaxing' stretching routine that targets the full body, back, and legs, underlining stretching as the main activity. Thus, 'Stretching' is a primary category with a score of 0.9 due to explicit emphasis.\n\n'Yoga' is included as a secondary category with a score of 0.4 because the tags mention 'yoga', and yoga equipment like yoga mats are referenced in the description. However, since the focus is more on general flexibility and stretching rather than traditional yoga practices, it is less central. \n\nLastly, 'Mat' is considered with a score of 0.3 due to the likely use of an exercise mat for performing these floor-based stretching routines, but it is not a strong focus of the content.\n\nOther categories were excluded as they do not align with the video's explicit focus on stretching and increasing flexibility."
