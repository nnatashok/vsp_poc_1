  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves pilates, which generally requires some understanding of proper form and engagement of the core, but as an 8-minute at-home session, it likely doesn't require overly complex techniques. The inclusion of 'deep core activation' suggests an intermediate understanding of engaging and stabilizing the core muscles is beneficial. However, the focus is on abs, and pilates is known for being accessible, thus Beginner-level users might find it slightly challenging but doable.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 8-minute duration suggests a relatively light session, but the description mentions 'intense' and 'deep core activation,' indicating moderate effort. User comments and the challenge aspect reinforce the idea that it\u2019s somewhat challenging but not excessively demanding, aligning with Moderate effort difficulty.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Combining the technique and effort difficulty, the workout fits Intermediate users best, as they can handle core activation better. Beginners will find the challenge possible but slightly tough, as reflected by user experiences and encouragement to perform modified variations. Advanced users might find it less intense but still beneficial as part of a more extensive routine. The 14-day challenge and the option to pair with longer workouts support inclusion of multiple fitness levels, particularly for those who can adjust engagement and intensity."
