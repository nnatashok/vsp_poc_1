  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is predominantly classified under 'Calisthenics', explicitly indicated by the video\u2019s title \"10 Best Exercises To Start Calisthenics | + Beginner Workout Routine\" and repeated mentions throughout the description and tags. Phrases such as \"beginner calisthenics\", \"get stronger in the basics of calisthenics\", and \"building a strong calisthenics foundation\" highlight a strong focus on this exercise form, justifying the maximum score of 1.0. The channel name and focus further support this classification, suggesting the channel specializes in calisthenics content.\n\nA secondary category, 'Body weight', is applicable because calisthenics inherently uses body weight for exercises such as pike push-ups and pull-ups, as noted in the comments. This aligns with the principles of body weight training, though it is not the central theme, thus receiving a moderate score of 0.7. The overall confidence in classifying these categories is very high, given the ample and explicit metadata evidence and user comments reflecting the video's calisthenics theme."
