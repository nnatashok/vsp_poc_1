  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is accurately categorized as 'Yoga' based on multiple indicators in the metadata. The title '20 Minute Everyday Yoga Flow | Daily Routine To Feel Your Best' explicitly mentions 'Yoga'. The description repeatedly emphasizes the yoga flow, describing it as a 'full body routine' with various yoga elements like hip openers, backbends, standing balances, and twists, further confirming its yoga nature. Additionally, the channel information emphasizes the creator's focus on yoga, describing her as a certified yoga teacher specializing in vinyasa flow, which aligns with the video's content. The presence of terms like 'vinyasa flow' and 'yoga flow' in both the description and channel information, along with the absence of any other fitness modality indicators, leads to a high confidence classification in the Yoga category. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong focus on yoga throughout the metadata, confirming its central role in the workout."
