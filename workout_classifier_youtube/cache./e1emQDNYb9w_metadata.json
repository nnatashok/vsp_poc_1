I constantly checked the progress, and I got this feeling I will not be able to complete my workout, drives me crazy. Everything has changed when I rendered my first movie. I focused on the exercise rather than on the progress. By wearing VR goggles I was cut from the surrounding world, and my consciousness was moved into the virtual reality. I was able to exercise for much longer, up to 60 min. Finally, I decided to share my experience with YouTube.\n\n#FitnessInVR #ExerciseBike #CardioExercise",
