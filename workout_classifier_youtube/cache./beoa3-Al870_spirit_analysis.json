  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Flow & Rhythm' due to its focus on Pilates, a discipline known for smooth, continuous movement patterns which aligns with the description of working the 'entire body' and focusing on core strength. The use of music and the instructor's background as a dancer further supports this categorization, underscoring a mind-body connection and rhythm. The 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is given a 0.75 score due to the title and description's emphasis on a coordinated, flowing workout style. \n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is evident as well, highlighted by the fact that this is an 'Intermediate' Pilates session with methodological use of weights to enhance the workout, suggesting precision and progression in exercises. The inclusion of weights implies a structured enhancement of a typical Pilates routine, justifying a score of 0.65.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Soothing & Restorative' were considered but excluded since the workout is intermediate and doesn't emphasize high intensity or relaxation therapy; rather, it combines structure and flow."
