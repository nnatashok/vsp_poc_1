  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is primarily focused on yoga as indicated by both the title 'Chair Yoga Stretch for Beginners, Seniors & Everyone' and multiple tags such as 'Chair yoga', 'Yoga for seniors', and 'Seated yoga'. The description also emphasizes it as a 'yoga workout' and mentions typical yoga benefits like stress reduction and muscle relief. These factors contribute to a very high confidence level of 0.9 for the Yoga category, as it is the central focus of the video. \n\nThe Stretching category is also relevant, as suggested by the frequent mention of stretching in both the title and comments, such as 'Chair yoga stretch', 'Chair stretch', and 'I absolutely loved this stretch'. The description reinforces this by stating the workout will 'relieve sore and achy muscles and joints'. This gives a strong presence score of 0.8. \n\nThe channel\u2019s focus on senior and beginner-friendly content aligns with low-impact exercises typically encompassing stretching and yoga, excluding high-intensity or equipment-based categories."
