  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is predominantly categorized as 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.9, as it is an At-Home Pilates workout. Pilates, by nature, emphasizes smooth, continuous movements and often incorporates rhythmic breathing and coordination that align with 'Flow & Rhythm'. The title and description further highlight this by emphasizing the full-body nature, implying a comprehensive and balanced engagement, typical of a flow-based practice.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant, with a score of 0.6. The workout is described as energizing and contributes to a post-workout glow, which indicates elements of restoration and rejuvenation. User comments describing personal recovery journeys and feeling better through the practice further support this aspect. The gentle and empathetic instructional style hinted at in the comments also aligns with a partially restorative spirit.\n\nOther spirits were excluded due to the absence of high-intensity, structured drilling, sports-specific training, or outdoor settings. The lack of explicit indicators for 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Structured & Disciplined' in the metadata justifies their exclusion."
