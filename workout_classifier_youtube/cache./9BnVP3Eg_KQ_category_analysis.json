  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is explicitly a High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) workout, as indicated by both the title 'HIIT BEYOND | LES MILLS GRIT x Reebok 30-minute HIIT workout' and the description, which mentions \"LES MILLS GRIT Cardio is a 30-minute HIIT workout that improves cardiovascular fitness.\" The prominence of terms like 'hiit workout', 'high intensity interval training', and 'cardio' in the tags further reinforces this classification. Moreover, the description emphasizes the workout's cardiovascular benefits, which justifies an additional category of Cardio with a higher confidence. User comments reflect the workout's high intensity, further supporting the HIIT classification. Given the clear emphasis on high-intensity interval training throughout the metadata, the confidence in this classification is very high."
