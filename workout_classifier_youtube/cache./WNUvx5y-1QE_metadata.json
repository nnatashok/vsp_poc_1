    "When I do make a comment I rarely get a response but to Juice and Toya I am so happy I came across your page. Your workouts have helped me Soo much.   I have come to realize that at 49 doing alot if cardio wasn&#39;t working for me. It&#39;s funny how just by doing the dumbbell workouts are helping me to tone and lose inches. So want to reach my goal by January.",
    "Thank you for a great workout!  Journeying through chemo for breast cancer but your workouts are keeping me strong! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
    "Week 2, Day 3: Great cardio workout! I have to say when I see these the laziness tries to get to me, but after finishing it my body feels so good and refreshed.",
    "These workouts are really fun!  The music keeps me distracted from my tiredness because it\u2019s really good to listen to!  Thank you!<br>-Beth",
    "Week 2, Day 3 [02/11/22]; Workout completed + 10 Minute High Intensity Abs/Core Workout<br><br>I was so happy when we reached that 99% without burpees and that burpee challenge popped up.<br>Anyway, I loved noticing how I didn&#39;t feel the need to stop for more time and do it without so many modifications; I&#39;m getting better because of you guys and also my mental health. Thank you so much :).<br><br>NOTE: If you feel proud now, imagine how you&#39;ll feel when the challenge is over."
