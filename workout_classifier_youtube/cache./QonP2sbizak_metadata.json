Lucid dreaming is the ability to know you're dreaming while your dreaming. When practicing lucid dreaming it's important to keep a dream journal. Write in your journal each day upon waking up.

  "channelDescription": "This channel was created to help people with hypnosis and guided meditation audios. I will be providing hypnosis solutions for anxiety, relaxation, building confidence, attracting abundance, spiritual growth and much much more.\n\nThe guided meditation (or hypnosis) vocals will primarily be done by myself (Joe T.). In addition, many of the audios will feature music from myself as well.\n\nRemember, all forms of hypnosis are self-hypnosis which means you're the one in control. The hypnosis audios on this channel are for educational purposes only. Never listen to any of these guided meditations while driving or operating machinery.\n\nThank you.",

    "I didn&#39;t lucid dream but i could actually feel myself falling asleep. I legit used to think relaxation didn&#39;t exist. my body is always tense even when falling asleep. Tonight i finally learned what pure relaxation feels like and it was bliss, like sleeping on a cloud.",
    "Can&#39;t believe i had to get off of my forklift to listen to this",
    "i was 15 minutes in really deep into that relaxation and it was my first time really being into a meditation and an ad played some intense ass music and that shit made me panic frfr",
    "This is absolutely bonza. :D  After doing this meditation for a couple weeks I finally had the first lucid dream. It started off as an anxiety dream. Then I realized it was a dream and I said to myself &quot;I don&#39;t have to be bothered about any of this. I can do whatever I want!&quot; and I threw away the stuff I was carrying and walked away from the anxiety situation and spent the rest of the time having fun outdoors."
