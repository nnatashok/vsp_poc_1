  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video \"STRENGTH TRAINING for BEGINNERS | Build strength, get toned & speed up metabolism!\" predominantly aligns with the \"Structured & Disciplined\" spirit, suggested by the detailed focus on teaching proper form and technique. The description mentions explaining each exercise, which points to a methodical approach (score: 0.9). This structured nature is reinforced by the channel\u2019s emphasis on manageable workouts tailored for beginners and seniors, indicating a disciplined methodology.\n\nAdditionally, the video partially embodies the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit (score: 0.65). The workout is designed to be low-impact and gentle, catering especially to seniors and beginners, and it allows for exercises to be performed in a sitting position, which aligns with a focus on safety and gentle engagement rather than intensity.\n\nOther spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Sport & Agility\" were excluded due to the lack of high-intensity elements. The channel caters to a demographic looking for approachable and steady workouts rather than fast-paced, high-intensity ones."
