The detailed description and comments further emphasize tailored strength training for running efficiency and speed.\n\nThe secondary category 'Body weight' (Score 0.7) is suggested by exercises such as 'Plyometrics' and moves like 'Pogo jumps' and 'Box jumps' mentioned in the video breakdown and user comments. These are typically bodyweight exercises that improve explosive power, relevant for runners.\n\n'Weight workout' (Score 0.6) is also relevant due to the explicit mention of 'Strength Training' in the title, indicating the use of resistance or weights to enhance running performance.
