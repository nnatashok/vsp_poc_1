  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative', which is evident from the focus on therapeutic benefits, stress reduction, and inflammation relief, explicitly mentioned in the description as a 'therapeutic sequence' for 'preventative care.' Additionally, the content targeting 'carpal tunnel' and 'weak wrists' aligns with a focus on gentle healing and recovery. The user comments also reflect a restorative benefit, with multiple users acknowledging the session's role in pain relief and aiding in recovery from specific hand and wrist ailments. Therefore, a high confidence score of 0.9 is justified.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is a secondary spirit due to the targeted focus on wrists, hands, and fingers, requiring specific protocols for these areas. The structured nature of yoga as a practice and Adriene's methodical guidance also contribute to this categorization. However, it is not the predominant spirit, thus it receives a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nThe absence of high-intensity elements or an outdoor setting excludes other spirits. The overall focus is on soothing practice over high energy or adventure."
