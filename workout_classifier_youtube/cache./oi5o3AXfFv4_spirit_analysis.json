  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit prominently, indicated by phrases like 'Killer HIIT workout,' 'intense HIIT,' and 'work hard, enjoy the sweat' in the title, description, and comments. The high number of likes and views further support this, suggesting a workout that challenges limits with its non-stop pacing and high demand. A score of 0.9 reflects its strong intensity focus.\n\nThe 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is supported by the methodical format of the workout: a defined 45-minute session with a specific interval structure (50 seconds work and 10 seconds rest), targeting all major muscle groups with no repetition. This structured approach, designed to systematically build strength and endurance, justifies a score of 0.75.\n\nA mild element of 'Flow & Rhythm' may be present due to the continuous movement and music-driven aspect mentioned, but it is not the primary focus, hence a lower score of 0.2. The absence of references to music-based coordination excludes higher confidence for Flow & Rhythm."
