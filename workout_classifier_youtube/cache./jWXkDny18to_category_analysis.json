  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as 'Breathing exercises' with a score of 0.9 based on the explicit mentions in the title and tags, such as 'breath holds,' 'guided breathing,' and 'pranayama breathing.' These indicate that the video focuses on controlled breathing techniques. The second category 'Meditation' is assigned a score of 0.8 due to mentions in the tags and description of 'meditation,' 'deep relaxation,' and 'fall asleep meditation,' suggesting the integration of mental focus and relaxation indicative of meditation practices. The channel's focus on guided breathing exercises further supports these classifications. Other potential categories such as 'Yoga' are not as strongly indicated despite mentions like 'yoga breathing exercises,' as the primary emphasis is on breathwork and meditation."
