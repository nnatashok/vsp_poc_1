  "spiritsExplanation": "The video combines elements of Pilates and Yoga, suggesting a fluid and smooth transition between exercises, typical of the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit. This is supported by phrases such as 'fusion workout', 'yoga pilates', and 'move with Nicole', indicating an emphasis on continuous movement and a mind-body connection. The music mention also implies a rhythmic component. The mention of 'full body stretch & strengthen' alongside user comments about feeling 'energized and super calm' and a request for a 'guided savanna' (a form of meditation) indicate a strong presence of 'Soothing & Restorative' qualities, focusing on relaxation and stress reduction. This dual focus results in a high confidence level of 0.85 and strong scores for both spirits. The structured nature of Pilates and the description imply some 'Structured & Disciplined' elements, but this is secondary and not as prominent as the others."
