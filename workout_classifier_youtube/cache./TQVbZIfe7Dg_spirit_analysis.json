  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit identified for this video is 'Soothing & Restorative', with a very high confidence level (score of 1). This classification is based on the title 'Inner Silence Guided Meditation' and the description which emphasizes healing, serenity, and the transition from a busy mind to a still one. Tags like 'relaxation meditation', 'calm', 'peace', and 'healing meditation' strongly support this spirit, highlighting a focus on stress reduction and tranquility. \n\nThe secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm', is also moderately relevant (score of 0.5) due to the guided nature of the meditation, which often involves a rhythmic, continuous flow of instructions and a potential integration of music, as indicated by the tag 'deep relaxing music'. The meditative process itself can embody flow through mindful, continuous focus and mental alignment.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are clearly irrelevant here, as there are no indications of physical intensity or sports-based elements. The 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirit is excluded due to the absence of any mention of nature or outdoor environments."
