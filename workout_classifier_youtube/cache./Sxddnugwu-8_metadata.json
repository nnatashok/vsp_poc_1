    "I wanted to say that this morning I was looking at my phone feeling so alone and wishing that someone would call or text, got a notification email and thought it was just some sale advertisement, but it was yours. It may sound stupid but with you and your wonderful spirit I do not feel so lonely, and I feel very special after this practice. This really brought me out of a dark place tonight. I hope you know how much of a blessing these free yoga videos are and how you&#39;ve really changed my life for the better through your channel. I love you Adriene!",
    "To everyone struggling with this issue. You&#39;re strong and you will get through it. One moment at a time. You&#39;re awesome!",
    "When she said \u201ctrust yourself\u201d I started to cry. Thank you Adriene. For anyone who see this comment, you are amazing.",
    "Not sure who needs to hear this - if things are rough for you right now, hang in there. This storm will pass. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other. Baby steps, my dear. As long as you don\u2019t quit, you will reach the summit. Remember, baby steps are all it takes. Take a brief moment to rest, refuel, and come back stronger. You can do this. And when you reach the top, you\u2019ll be glad you didn\u2019t stop. Slowly, but surely, you\u2019ll get there. Don\u2019t give up. You can do this. \u2764\ufe0f",
    "Just 5 min before I decided to do this video, I was crying so much that my body was starting to hurt. I am not yoga person so i just searched some depression yoga and clicked. I was afraid of some difficult poses and what I&#39;ve got was literally a cure for my pain. I think I&#39;m gonna do your videos daily so I can start to feel like myself again and push away all the dark thoughts. Thank you. (Sorry for my english, it&#39;s not my first language)"
