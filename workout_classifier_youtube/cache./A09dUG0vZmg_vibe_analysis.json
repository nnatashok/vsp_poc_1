  "vibesExplanation": "The workout primarily aligns with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe due to its focus on technique and form, which is evident from the description discussing intermediate level Pilates and the emphasis on a comprehensive, full-body workout. The comments also highlight the meticulous nature of the session, noting the focus on true Pilates, which suggests a strong emphasis on mastering technique (score: 0.8).\n\nThe 'Foundation Builder' vibe is relevant given the workout's focus on low impact, core development, and full-body conditioning, which are foundational aspects of Pilates. The description and channel description both emphasize building strength and improving fitness levels at home (score: 0.6).\n\nThere is also a hint of 'The Progression Quest' in the video, particularly highlighted by the promotion of structured challenges and progression tools within the RA Pilates app. This suggests a methodical approach to long-term improvement, though it is less explicit in the video itself (score: 0.4).\n\nOther vibes were excluded because the workout doesn't primarily focus on high intensity or explosive energy typically found in vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter.' Additionally, it lacks the relaxation focus of a 'Zen Flow' style."
