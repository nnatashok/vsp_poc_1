  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified as a 'Weight workout' with high confidence. The title ('30 minute strength workout with dumbbells') explicitly indicates the use of weights, specifically dumbbells, which strongly aligns with the 'Weight workout' category. The description further specifies the use of dumbbells, heavy lifting, and provides a detailed exercise list focused on arms and shoulders, reinforcing the category choice. The structured workout (2 sets of 12 exercises targeting biceps, triceps, and shoulders, with specific work and rest periods) emphasizes strength training with weights. Other categories like 'Body weight' or 'Calisthenics' are excluded due to the explicit focus on using dumbbells for resistance. Overall, the metadata strongly supports 'Weight workout' as the most fitting category."
