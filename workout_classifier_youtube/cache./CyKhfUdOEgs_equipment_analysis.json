  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Mindfulness Meditation Body Scan' is focused on a mindfulness meditation practice called a body scan, as indicated by the title, tags, and description. This type of meditation typically involves lying down or sitting comfortably, which can be done on any surface. There is no mention of any specific exercise equipment in the title, description, tags, or comments. It's a meditation session rather than a physical workout, meaning no traditional workout equipment is needed. Therefore, the workout appears to be entirely bodyweight only, requiring no additional equipment."
