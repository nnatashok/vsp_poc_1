  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout \"10MIN everyday full body hourglass pilates workout // beginner friendly //w/verbal cues | LIDIAVMERA\" embodies the \"Flow & Rhythm\" spirit due to the nature of Pilates exercises, which emphasize smooth and controlled movements combined with rhythmic breathing. This is supported by comments highlighting the focus on mindful movement and the absence of loud music, allowing for a connection between body and mind. The description invites both beginners and more advanced participants to engage with variations, suggesting adaptability within structured movement sequences. The \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit is also present, indicated by user feedback such as comments describing the workout as calming, reducing anxiety, and supporting proper form, which aligns with restorative elements. The verbal cues and emphasis on breathing underscore the workout's restorative qualities. Other potential spirits, like \"High-Energy & Intense,\" are excluded due to the generally calming and beginner-friendly approach, while the lack of outdoor context rules out \"Outdoor & Adventure.\" The confidence level is high at 0.85 due to clear signals consistent with both assigned spirits."
