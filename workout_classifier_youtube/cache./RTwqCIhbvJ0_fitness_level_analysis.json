  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises described in the metadata, such as knee raises, lateral arm circles, and side leg raises, are straightforward and do not require jumping or complex coordination. This makes them suitable primarily for beginner fitness levels. However, the variety of exercises and the presence of movements like skater jumps introduce a mild degree of coordination, slightly raising the complexity to include a minor intermediate level aspect.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Given its 16-minute duration and low-impact, no-jumping nature, the workout is fundamentally light in effort difficulty. However, the consistent movement flow and inclusion of repeated movements like skater jumps slightly increase the energy expenditure, warranting a mild classification of moderate difficulty.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The simple, low-impact nature of this workout indicates it's well-suited for beginners, corroborated by comments praising its simplicity and accessibility. However, frequent mention of weight loss success and consistency in practice implies it presents a sufficient challenge to also fit an intermediate level. These factors, coupled with the effort and technique difficulty scores, justify assigning both beginner and intermediate fitness levels, especially since users can pace themselves or increase repetitions for greater challenge."
