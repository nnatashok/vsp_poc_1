  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Guided Meditation with Mooji \u2014 Just Be!' appears to be focused on meditation and self-awareness rather than physical exercise. The metadata, including the title, description, and tags, emphasize meditation, spirituality, and self-realization. There is no mention of any physical exercise or equipment such as a mat or yoga blocks, which might be associated with seated meditation or yoga. The content revolves around non-duality, self-inquiry, and consciousness, suggesting that this is a mental or spiritual practice rather than a physical one. Therefore, it can be concluded with high confidence that no physical equipment is needed, and the activity is bodyweight only."
