  "vibesExplanation": "The video 'A 10-Minute Journey to Inner Peace | Guided Meditation' is strongly characterized by elements that align with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe. The phrase 'inner peace' in the title and consistent references to 'serenity', 'peace', and 'self-discovery' in the description suggest a focus on nervous system reset and gentle guidance, which are core aspects of 'The Deep Recharge'. The high engagement with emotional comments such as 'crying during this meditation' and 'Tears of healing' further supports this classification, reflecting an emotional release and reset experience. The 'Zen Flow' vibe is also appropriate as the video emphasizes grounding and intentional, breath-centered meditation, as highlighted by the calming descriptive language used ('journey', 'walk this path of inner peace', 'universe conspires to support') and the focus on profound insights and inner harmony. This alignment justifies a high confidence score due to explicit indicators throughout the metadata, signaling a deep and tranquil experiential quality."
