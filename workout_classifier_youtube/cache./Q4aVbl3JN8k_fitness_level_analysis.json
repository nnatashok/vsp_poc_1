  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves using an exercise bike and treadmill, which are considered beginner-friendly equipment due to their simplicity of use. Exercise bikes and treadmills typically require basic movement patterns such as pedaling and walking or jogging, which do not demand advanced coordination or complex techniques. This aligns with a Beginner level of technique difficulty. The possibility of increasing treadmill speed or altering bike resistance slightly elevates it to Intermediate for users who may try different settings or incorporate more complex variations.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video duration of 11:21 minutes suggests a Light effort difficulty, as this is relatively short for cardio workouts, typically requiring low energy expenditure for users in an unfit demographic. However, depending on treadmill speed and bike resistance, the effort might modestly increase to a Moderate level for those opting to challenge themselves, especially if heart rate elevation is pursued, implying that it can offer some exercise stimulus but remains mostly accessible.",

The focus on small, actionable steps and the motivational approach caters to unfit users starting their fitness journey. The inclusion of Intermediate level accounts for users who might use higher intensities on the equipment or incorporate more variation in their workout, though the primary target is the beginner audience."
