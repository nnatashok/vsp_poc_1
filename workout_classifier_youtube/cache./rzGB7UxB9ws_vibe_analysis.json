  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified for this workout is \"The Zen Flow\" with a score of 0.8, due to the emphasis on gentle, breath-centered movement aimed at easing tension and tightness, as described in the title and description. The phrases \"gentle beginner friendly\" and \"ease some of the tension\" suggest a calm, intentional approach typical of Zen Flow. Additionally, \"gentle yoga\" and \"slow yoga lower back\" tags support this vibe.\n\nThe secondary vibe identified is \"The Reboot Workout\" with a score of 0.7. This is because the workout focuses on relieving tightness and tension, acting as a \"low stress, total-body refresh,\" particularly appealing as evening practice for those who sit a lot during the day, as mentioned in the description. The positive feedback in comments about pain relief and re-energization further support this classification.\n\nOther potential vibes like \"The Meditative Grind\" were considered but excluded due to the workout's short duration and focus on relaxation, which are not aligned with the repetitive, endurance-focused nature of Meditative Grind."
