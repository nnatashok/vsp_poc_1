  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.75 due to the emphasis on a dynamic and coordinated movement pattern typical of Pilates, as noted in the description 'dynamic and fast-paced' and the Pilates focus of the channel. This suggests a smooth, music-driven session, ideal for intermediate users familiar with these exercises.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' is also relevant, scoring a 0.65, as indicated by comments describing the workout as 'tiny but MIGHTY' and mentioning a 'burning but totally rewarding sweat', which points to a higher intensity level than typical Pilates sessions. The increased energy expenditure aligns with a fast-paced class.\n\nThe structured nature of Pilates could suggest 'Structured & Disciplined', but the video focuses more on dynamic movement than strict technical precision. Therefore, it was not selected as a primary spirit. 'Soothing & Restorative', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are not applicable as the video is not focused on relaxation, sport-specific training, or outdoor elements."
