  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The title and tags explicitly state this is a 'yoga flow for beginners,' which suggests simple, accessible movements suitable for first-time practitioners. The description reinforces this by indicating that the flow is slower than traditional vinyasa, making it less technically demanding. The channel typically provides content suitable for a wide range of fitness levels, implying adaptations for less experienced users. Comments from users who are new to yoga confirm the accessible nature of the routine, aligning with a Beginner classification, but the use of 'flow' sequences implies a slight intermediate challenge due to the coordination required.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 20 minutes, which is on the cusp of being more demanding but still generally light. It's described as slower than traditional vinyasa, which typically means lower intensity. Tags like 'yoga for beginners' and positive comments from first-time users suggest this has low energy expenditure. While yoga can increase in effort based on intensity and holding poses, this sequence's slow pace strongly indicates a Light level of effort but allows for a minimal Moderate classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the Beginner technique difficulty and Light effort difficulty, this yoga session is well-suited for beginners, as underscored by the video's categorization and user feedback. The Beginner classification is dominant due to the accessibility of the practice for first-timers. However, since yoga requires some coordination and balance, and uses techniques like flow sequences, there's a slight overlap with Intermediate for those who want to push further or have a basic familiarity with exercise, underscored by the video's moderate alignment to Intermediate users."
