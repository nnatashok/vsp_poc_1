  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is focused on a guided meditation titled 'Deep Relaxation in 7 Minutes.' Based on the metadata, including the title, description, and channel information, this video is a meditation session designed to induce relaxation through guided imagery and a soothing voice. There is no mention of any physical activity or exercises that would require equipment. The comments further support the focus on meditation and deep relaxation, rather than physical movement. Therefore, no equipment such as mats or other fitness tools is needed, and the workout is purely bodyweight-only, focused on mental relaxation."
