Meanwhile, the mention of making aerobics fun by watching videos or listening to music while working out suggests an element of 'Flow & Rhythm,' as these activities can enhance the workout experience by incorporating music-driven pacing and coordination (score 0.7). The tags such as '#funcardio' and 'cyclingindoor' further support this by emphasizing enjoyable pacing in a rhythmic environment.
