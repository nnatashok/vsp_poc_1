  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is tagged and described as an 'intermediate' yoga class, indicating that it includes poses and transitions requiring more than basic coordination and balance. The phrases 'deep stretch' and 'pigeon pose' suggest techniques that involve more advanced flexibility and awareness of proper form, which is more suited to those beyond a beginner level. However, no props are needed and the description mentions feeling good, suggesting some level of accessibility beyond advanced yoga practice.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "With a duration of 19 minutes, this yoga flow is unlikely to be extremely demanding in terms of effort. Descriptions such as 'flow' and 'feel good' suggest a gentle yet consistent movement style typical of moderate yoga classes. While 'slow flow' indicates lower intensity, 'dynamic stretching' and 'yoga for flexibility' can imply some degree of effort, raising it slightly above what would be considered 'light'.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Although this yoga class is aimed at an 'intermediate' level, the video length and community feedback indicate accessibility for beginners who are willing to challenge themselves slightly. Comments suggest it's beneficial even for those with limited time, implying lower barriers to entry. However, the presence of more complex poses like the pigeon and dynamic sequences justifies the inclusion of intermediate and advanced levels. This wider scope fits the channel's tendency to cater to varied skill levels."
