  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Body weight' with a high score of 0.9. This is due to the video being a 'home workout without equipment,' 'no equipment workout,' and 'bodyweight workout,' as highlighted in both the tags and the description. The video focuses on using body weight to perform exercises that aid in weight gain for individuals who are skinny, confirming the use of bodyweight exercises. The channel description further reinforces the focus on bodyweight workouts. The intensity mentioned ('INTENSE Weight Gain Workout') suggests a vigorous routine but still primarily revolves around bodyweight movements. Other categories such as 'Weight workout' are explicitly excluded as the description and tags clearly state no weights or additional equipment are used in this workout."
