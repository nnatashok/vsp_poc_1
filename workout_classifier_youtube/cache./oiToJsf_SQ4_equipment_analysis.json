  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video explicitly mentions \"Mat\" in both the title and tags, such as \"mat pilates\" and in the description, where Nicole provides a link to purchase a mat from Liforme. This establishes high confidence that a mat is needed for the Pilates exercises. Pilates workouts typically involve exercises performed on the floor, further supporting the requirement of a mat for comfort and effective execution of the routines. No other equipment is suggested or implied in the metadata, indicating that the workout is focused on bodyweight exercises with the primary support of a mat."
