The primary focus of the video is on inducing deep relaxation and meditation, with extensive use of calming frequencies like 432Hz and 111Hz, explicitly mentioned in the title as well as throughout the description. This strongly suggests 'The Zen Flow' with its grounding, breath-centered qualities, scoring 0.9 due to the video\u2019s emphasis on achieving inner peace and balance.\n\n'\"The Deep Recharge\" is also a strong vibe as the content focuses on emotional release and nervous system reset, evidenced by descriptions of achieving a \"divine level of meditation.\" This matches the vibe's characteristics and is supported by the calming intention mentioned, justifying a score of 0.8.\n\nLastly, 'The Sleep Prep' is a fitting classification given the purpose of the music also being conducive to sleep, explicitly stated in the title and description which describe music designed for sleep and inducing a peaceful state. The overlap in relaxation and sleep preparation themes justify a score of 0.7 for 'The Sleep Prep.'\n\nOther high-energy or intense vibes were excluded due to the lack of any hints towards physical exertion or dynamic movement, with the focus instead on meditation and tranquility."
