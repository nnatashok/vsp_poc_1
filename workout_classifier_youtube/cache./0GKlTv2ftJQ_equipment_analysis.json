  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"15 Min Manual Treadmill Interval Workout for Beginners\" clearly indicates that a manual treadmill is required, as it is the central equipment around which the interval workout is designed. The description explicitly mentions a 'manual treadmill at home' and the workout details outline different interval and resistance settings on a treadmill. Additionally, the 'FITNESS EQUIPMENT USED' section specifies the 'Force Fitmill Manual Treadmill SF-T7723,' providing a direct link to the product. Tags include 'manual treadmill interval workout' and 'treadmill interval workout.' Collectively, these points justify a very high confidence score of 1.0 for the Treadmill as required equipment."
