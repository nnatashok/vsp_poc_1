  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Enter a Deep Sleep while Connecting to your Higher Self (Guided Meditation)' is quintessentially 'Soothing & Restorative.' This is predominantly indicated by the title that emphasizes 'Deep Sleep' and 'Guided Meditation,' suggesting a clear focus on relaxation and stress reduction. The description reinforces this spirit by describing the session as a 'profound journey' for stress release, introspection, and inner peace, promoting 'rejuvenation' and the 'restorative power of sleep.' This language is strongly aligned with the 'Soothing & Restorative' category. Additionally, tags like 'deep sleep,' 'guided meditation sleep,' and repeated mentions of 'meditation' support this classification. Comments further affirm the impact on relaxation and recovery, highlighting experiences of waking up feeling 'amazing, positive, and reset.' The absence of terms related to physical intensity, structure, or coordination rules out other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Flow & Rhythm,' and 'Structured & Disciplined.' Therefore, the primary spirit classification is made with very high confidence and a strong match score."
