    "At this point Anna is pretty much the only fitness trainer that I just click her videos and start working right away, I just know I&#39;d love it and it will be painful in the best way. Thank you  so much for everything you do, you have no idea how much you&#39;re changing my physical and mental health, and so many others \ud83d\udc95",
    "I&#39;ve done it with 3 kgs dumpbell /arm but I feel this a great personal achievement, as I have started this job with 95 kgs (40 years old) and I am 64 kgs now (46 years old). Thanks a lot for your job because your workouts help me to feel myself as a queen! &lt;3",
    "i love no repeat workouts. they never get boring. it keeps me wondering what will next move will be...",
    "I took a 3-4 day break after doing 24 minutes of this video. Working out 3 times in a row, constantly being on my feet at work, and little breaks got me tired so i stopped at that mark. Today, my goal was to pass that mark and see how I&#39;ve improved. I ended up finishing the whole video with sufficient breaks and i feel great! Random but i just love working out and pushing myself. It helps so much, especially when you&#39;re prone to feeling anxious and dealing with hard circumstances. Im grateful to be  moving and living in the moment \ud83d\ude4f",
    "YAY! I&#39;m so excited for this!!! No repeats dumbbell focused on strength - my FAVORITE type of workout!!!"
