  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is 'Meditation' with a high score of 0.9, as the video is explicitly a 'Guided Meditation for Anxiety' as stated in the title and description. The overall channel focus is on meditation, as seen in the description and the numerous meditation tags such as 'guided meditation for anxiety,' 'mindfulness meditation,' 'positive affirmations,' and 'vipassana meditation.' The second category, 'Breathing exercises,' is included with a score of 0.6, supported by the mention of 'focused breath practice' in the description and the tag 'breathing,' suggesting a significant element of controlled breathing techniques within the meditation session. Other potential categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Mindful movement' were not chosen, as there is no indication of physical postures or movement exercises involved in this particular video. The confidence level is high due to the clear metadata pointing towards a meditation-centric activity."
