  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Flow & Rhythm' with a high score of 0.9. This is evidenced by the repeated emphasis on 'vinyasa flow', 'yoga flow', and 'movement yoga' in the tags, which suggest a continuous and rhythmical style of exercise. The description highlights it as a 'short 5 minute movement yoga class,' indicating the focus is on fluid movements that characterize the Flow & Rhythm spirit.\n\nAdditionally, 'Soothing & Restorative' is a secondary spirit with a score of 0.7. The purpose is to 'energize and get you ready for a great day', implying a gentle awakening effect rather than an intense workout. User comments also refer to the practice's 'softness' and 'spaciousness', further supporting a soothing element.\n\nThe workout is not classified under other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' due to its intended mild energy boost and focus on flow and relaxation instead of intensity or athletic performance."
