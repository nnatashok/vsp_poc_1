  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Shower of Grace | A Guided Meditation with Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar' is categorized as a guided meditation session. Throughout the metadata, including the title, tags, and description, there is no mention of any physical exercise or fitness equipment. The meditation involves practices like Sudarshan Kriya and Pranayama, which are breathing techniques, along with yoga and guided meditation. These activities typically do not require equipment beyond a comfortable space or perhaps a mat, but the video content and related comments do not specify the need for any specific equipment.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded with high confidence that this meditation session relies on techniques that are primarily non-physical and introspective, likely not requiring any physical workout equipment. As such, the classification is that the workout appears to be bodyweight only, with no equipment necessary."
