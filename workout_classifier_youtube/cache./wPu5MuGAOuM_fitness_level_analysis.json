  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video focuses on stretching routines with basic movements possibly complemented by an intermediate level of coordination and body awareness, given the context of improving flexibility and the channel's yoga focus. The metadata suggests some guidance on technique, such as detailed instructions against the wall, which implies slightly increased complexity. However, the mention of 'cozy stretch day' indicates accessibility to beginners. Comments about 'challenging' stretches imply intermediate difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a stretch routine integrated with mobility elements, indicating primarily a light effort difficulty suitable for early-stage fitness levels. The duration of 26 minutes suggests a potential for moderate effort, but considering it is a stretch routine, the primary challenge seems to be holding poses rather than high energy expenditure. The relaxed and instructional nature described in comments leans more towards low to moderate intensity.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout predominantly fits beginner and intermediate levels due to its focus on stretching with some technique involved. While it is a stretch routine, the description's emphasis on improving mobility and comments mentioning the challenge suggest it could cater to those new to fitness but also those with a little more experience looking to improve flexibility. The 26-minute duration skews it away from pure beginner, thus supporting the inclusion of both beginner and intermediate levels."
