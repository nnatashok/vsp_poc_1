  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily focused on exercises to manage intercostal muscle pain, which strongly suggests a focus on stretching and possibly breathing exercises. The title explicitly mentions 'intercostal muscle pain,' and the use of terms 'routine for rib pain' and 'intercostal strain' in the tags further supports this classification. \n\nThe channel's focus on physiotherapy and pain management implies exercises designed to gently stretch and relieve tension in affected muscle areas, aligning well with the 'Stretching' category. User comments highlight the improvement in flexibility and mobility, supporting the high score of 0.8 for 'Stretching.'\n\nThe mention of 'breathing and isolating the rib cage' in the comments indicates a focus on breathing exercises, which is relevant for managing intercostal discomfort and aligns with 'Breathing exercises' as a supportive category with a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nThere is a potential overlap with general therapeutic routines, but the evidence primarily supports stretching and breathing, so a score for 'Other' is set at 0.4 to account for any additional therapeutic elements not explicitly captured by stretching or breathing."
