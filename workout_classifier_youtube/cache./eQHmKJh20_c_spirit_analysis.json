  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative.' The title suggests a focus on stretching within a short timeframe, indicating a gentle and recovery-focused session. The comments extract further supports this, with users appreciating the routine's ability to alleviate stress and provide emotional and physical relief, suggesting a high match score of 0.9 for this spirit. The comment about doing the routine in a casual setting enhances the restorative aspect by making it accessible and relaxing.\n\nAdditionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is somewhat present. The use of phrases such as 'Follow along' in the title suggests an element of smooth, continuous movement throughout the session, earning it a moderate score of 0.6. Although the primary spirit is restorative, the series of structured stretches introduced in a sequence shows an implicit flow element. However, the short duration and stretching focus prevent it from fully embodying 'Flow & Rhythm'.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the absence of intense exercises or sports-specific skills."
