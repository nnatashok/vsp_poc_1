  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title explicitly states \"NO REPEAT\" and tags such as \"cardio hiit workout no equipment,\" \"full body hiit workout no equipment,\" and \"cardio workout at home\" strongly suggest that no equipment is required. The lack of equipment mention in the description and the comments praising the workout's structure without the need for equipment confirm that this workout is designed to be bodyweight only. Given that the workout focuses on high intensity strength, cardio, and plyometric movements, it is typical in a HIIT workout context to rely solely on bodyweight exercises, especially since modifications are available for any advanced moves. Therefore, the confidence is very high (0.9-1.0) that no equipment is needed for this workout."
