  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is a guided meditation, which typically involves sitting or lying in a comfortable position and listening to audio instructions. This requires very minimal physical technique, as the focus is on mental engagement and relaxation rather than physical movement or coordination. Therefore, the technique difficulty for this meditation session is classified as 'Beginner'. No complex movements or physical exercises are involved.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The meditation session is classified as Light in effort difficulty because it does not involve physical exertion or any active energy expenditure. The only potential 'effort' is the mental focus required for following the guided instructions. Since the primary action is meditative and sedentary, it is suitable for all fitness levels, particularly beginners or those looking for minimal physical demand.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the 'Beginner' technique difficulty and 'Light' effort difficulty, the required fitness level is appropriately classified as 'Beginner'. This session is suitable for anyone, especially those new to meditation or physical exercise. The absence of physical activity means that no pre-existing fitness level is required, aligning perfectly with a beginner-friendly categorization."
