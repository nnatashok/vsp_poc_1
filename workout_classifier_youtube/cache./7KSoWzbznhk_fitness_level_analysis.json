  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The title and description of the video clearly identify this as a \"beginner flexibility routine,\" emphasizing that it is simple and straightforward. The focus is on a basic full body stretch and cool down, which involves minimal coordination and complexity, typical of beginner-level techniques.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the explicit mention as a 'beginner flexibility routine,' the primary fitness level is Beginner. However, including Intermediate is reasonable due to the potential benefit it provides for slightly more conditioned individuals looking to improve flexibility as seen from user comments suggesting progress over time. The technique and effort difficulties support a classification suitable for Beginners, and the slight inclusion of Intermediate reflects the typical need to consider more fitness levels where possible, even if minimally required."
