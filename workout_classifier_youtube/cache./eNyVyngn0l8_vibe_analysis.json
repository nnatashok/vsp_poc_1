  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is best categorized with 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its fast-paced, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) format, as highlighted by the term 'pyramid set of one-minute intervals'. This structure indicates short, intense bursts of effort, aligning with the 'explosive and electrifying' essence of 'The Firestarter'. The use of the term 'HIIT' in tags and description supports this classification, earning it a confidence score of 0.8.\n\nConcurrently, 'The Endorphin Wave' is applicable as the session promises an elevated energy and a feel-good movement, evident from positive user feedback like 'my new favorite' and 'saving my legs... feeling alive', justifying a score of 0.7. This is further reinforced by the continuous, steady workout nature typical of cycling routines, leading to an endorphin-heavy experience.\n\n'Another related vibe is 'The Meditative Grind', inferred from the indoor cycling format\u2014characterized by repetitive and rhythmically intense efforts, also mirrored in the comments citing relief from discomfort and a sense of thorough engagement. This supports a moderate score of 0.6.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Nightclub Workout' were considered but not selected due to lack of emphasis on music-driven euphoria or ambiance typically found in such workouts."
