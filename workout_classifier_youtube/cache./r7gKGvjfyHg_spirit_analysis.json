  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily under 'High-Energy & Intense' because it involves a challenging 10-minute ab complex designed to 'embrace the burn,' as noted in the description. The repetition of exercises and encouragement to 'Embrace the burn!!' suggests a high-energy, intense focus on pushing limits (score: 0.7). The comments further support feelings of challenge and exertion, commonly associated with high-intensity workouts. \n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is also highly relevant due to the clear arrangement and progression of exercises (e.g., X20 table top crunch, X10 hip raise, etc.), providing a systematic approach typical of structured training (score: 0.75). With precise exercise protocols and repetition counts, the workout indeed embodies discipline and methodical progression.\n\nThe less emphasis on rest, flow, or recovery aspects fits these spirits well, excluding 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Flow & Rhythm'."
