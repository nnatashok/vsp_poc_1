  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.75,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is primarily beginner due to the simplicity of breathing exercises that require minimal coordination and are accessible with basic guidance. However, intermediate aspects are noted because of potential complexities in breath regulation and the need to be mindful of physical responses, as mentioned in the safety disclaimer. Terms like 'Wim Hof breathing' and 'DMT breathing' suggest some familiarity with breath techniques, slightly elevating the complexity for complete beginners.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as light, as breathing exercises are inherently low in physical exertion, with no significant physical output or extended duration noted. Terms such as 'guided breathwork' and emphasis on relaxation support this classification. Potential tingling or light-headedness, while notable, do not significantly increase physical effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level includes beginner and intermediate due to the simple nature of the exercises and their limited duration, making them accessible to a broad audience. The safety notes imply a need for some awareness of one's own physical limits, which aligns with an intermediate classification but is generally suitable for beginners. The presence of potential light-headedness necessitates basic body awareness, but is not substantial enough to exclude beginners."
