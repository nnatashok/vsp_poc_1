  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as 'Meditation' due to its strong emphasis on guided meditation, as indicated by the title '10-Minute Guided Meditation: Self-Love,' the channel name 'SELF,' and the description detailing this as a session led by a meditation teacher focusing on self-love. The tags consistently reference meditation, reinforcing this classification. The comments further support this as they reflect the emotional impact and personal introspection typical of meditation experiences. A secondary category of 'Breathing exercises' is assigned with a lower score, reflecting the possible inclusion of breathing techniques that are often part of guided meditations, though not explicitly mentioned in the available metadata. Other categories such as 'Stretching' or 'Yoga' are excluded due to lack of evidence indicating any physical movement or postures."
