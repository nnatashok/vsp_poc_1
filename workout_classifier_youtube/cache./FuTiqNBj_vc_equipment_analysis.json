  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The analysis of the workout video metadata indicates that no equipment is needed for this workout. The title explicitly states \"no equipment\" which directly implies that the workout can be completed without the need for any additional tools or props. The video is described as a \"10MIN full body hourglass pilates workout\" which is also \"beginner friendly\", further suggesting that it is designed to be accessible without any equipment. The comments and description do not contradict this, focusing instead on the personal growth and changes users have experienced from the workout rather than mentioning any equipment usage. Taking into account these factors, it is clear that the workout is intended to be performed using only bodyweight, confirming a bodyweight-only workout."
