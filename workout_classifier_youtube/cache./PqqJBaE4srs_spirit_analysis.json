  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit with a score of 0.7. This is supported by the use of terms like 'sweaty,' 'intense cardio,' and 'fat burning' found in the title and tags, as well as the consistent pace indicated in user comments, despite the workout being 'apartment friendly' and 'no jumping.' The absence of jumping doesn't detract significantly from the intensity, as it can still be a tough, cardio-focused session especially given the description and user experiences expressed in comments such as users feeling sufficiently challenged.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is given a score of 0.2 given the reference to 'consistency' in the top comments, suggesting a continuous flow in the workout movements, and the mention of a 'simple, consistent pace' implies some rhythmic aspect.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' are not applicable due to the workout's focus on cardio intensity and being home-based."
