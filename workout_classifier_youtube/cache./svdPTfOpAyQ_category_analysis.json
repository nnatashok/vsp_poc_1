  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video '10 MIN SIX PACK ABS for TOTAL BEGINNERS (No Equipment)' is classified primarily under 'Mat' and 'Body weight' categories. The term 'No Equipment' in the title and description indicates exercises performed without additional tools, which often translates to mat-based workouts focusing on the ground movements. The video's emphasis on a 'beginner ab workout', and phrases like 'do this workout anywhere' and 'equipment free' reinforce the mat-based classification, resulting in a high confidence score of 0.9 for the 'Mat' category. The 'Body weight' classification is supported by the workout focusing on strengthening, as it involves bodyweight resistance to target the abdominal region. This correlates with tags like 'beginner ab workout' and 'six pack abs workout', yielding a moderate score of 0.7. The context of beginner-friendly exercises further eliminates categories that involve equipment or are not suitable for a straightforward core-focused routine."
