  "vibesExplanation": "The video is a guided meditation specifically aimed at dealing with anxiety, emphasizing a 'surrender session' for letting go, which aligns with the vibe of 'The Deep Recharge.' This vibe involves ultra-gentle movement and a focus on nervous system reset, which is consistent with the video's intention to induce relaxation, manage anxiety, and promote emotional regulation. Tags such as 'calming,' 'peaceful,' 'stress relief,' and 'sleep meditation' further reinforce this alignment. Comments highlight the emotional impact and changes experienced, such as improved sleep and reduced anxiety, indicative of a resetting and recharging focus. Given the strong emphasis on mental well-being and relaxation, 'The Deep Recharge' is a strong match with very high confidence. The content does not fit the more dynamic or physically engaging vibes, which is why this single vibe is chosen."
