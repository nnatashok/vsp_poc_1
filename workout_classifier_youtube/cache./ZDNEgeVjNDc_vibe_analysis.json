  "vibesExplanation": "This video is a classic example of 'The Deep Recharge' workout vibe, as evidenced by the focus on relaxation and stress release mentioned in the title and description. The video's purpose is to guide viewers into a deep and restful sleep, aligning perfectly with the 'Nervous system reset, ultra-gentle movement' characteristics. The metadata indicates an emphasis on relaxation, with phrases like 'ultimate relaxation technique' and 'help you drift off,' plus the removal of ads at the end to prevent disturbances, supporting a high confidence level.\n\nAdditionally, this type of content often aligns with 'The Sleep Prep' vibe, given its direct focus on preparing viewers for rest through a guided meditation aimed at inducing sleep, scoring a 0.9. The comments further reinforce the effectiveness and soothing nature of the video, highlighting its success in helping users sleep more effectively and restoring calmness.\n\nOverall, alternative vibes such as 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Mindful Walk' were excluded due to the video's explicit focus on sleep induction rather than active or breath-focused movement."
