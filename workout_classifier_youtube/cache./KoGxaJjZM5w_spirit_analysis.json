  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is strongly evident in this workout, as indicated by the detailed list of exercises provided in the description, the specific work-to-rest ratio (40 seconds work, 20 seconds rest), and the emphasis on 'good form and control'. These elements highlight a methodical and organized approach aimed at building strength and stability. The score of 0.8 reflects the strong alignment with this spirit due to the clear, systematic nature of the workout.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant, though to a slightly lesser extent, and is given a score of 0.6. The workout is specifically designed for women going through menopause, a stage that can require gentle, supportive activities. The workout aims to 'boost mood' and is intended to be supportive, aligning with restorative qualities. \n\nOther spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense', are excluded due to the absence of explicit emphasis on high intensity or maximum effort, while 'Flow & Rhythm' is less applicable as the workout is structured rather than continuous in movement."
