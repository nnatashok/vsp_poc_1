  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The analysis of the video metadata conclusively indicates that the workout requires no equipment. The title \"Beginners Stretching Routine\" and description both emphasize that this is a stretching-focused routine suitable for all levels, requiring only a towel and cushion. These are typically household items used for support rather than fitness equipment. Furthermore, the description explicitly states \"No equipment is required,\" reinforcing that the routine is designed to use bodyweight and minimal, non-exercise-specific props. As such, no traditional workout equipment from the provided list is needed, leading to the conclusion that the workout is bodyweight only."
