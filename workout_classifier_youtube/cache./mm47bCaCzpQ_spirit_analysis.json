  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is classified as High-Energy & Intense with a score of 0.75. The title \"20 MINUTE UPPER BODY WORKOUT(NO EQUIPMENT)\" and tags such as 'hiit', 'sweat', and 'exercise' indicate a focus on high-intensity bodyweight exercises that are vigorous and demanding. Comments mention brief rest periods, indicative of intense intervals, and efforts to execute numerous push-up variations, aligning with a high-energy, sweat-inducing workout.\n\nThe video is also identified as Structured & Disciplined with a score of 0.65. The inclusion of a variety of targeted push-up exercises implies a well-organized workout session designed to methodically build upper body strength. The listing of specific exercises in user comments indicates a structured sequence that is methodically planned.\n\nSoothing & Restorative and Outdoor & Adventure are excluded due to the indoor setting, equipment-free design concentrating on intensity rather than relaxation or nature. Flow & Rhythm is not selected, as the content focuses more on structured sequences than continuous flow and music-driven pacing."
