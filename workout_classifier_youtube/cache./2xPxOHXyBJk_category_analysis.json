  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified primarily as a 'Weight workout' with a score of 1.0, as it explicitly involves the use of dumbbells throughout. This is supported by the title '15 min Full Body Workout with Dumbbells,' and reiterated in the description which details exercises involving dumbbells like 'Curl to Press' and 'Bent Over Row.' The presence of terms like 'strength training,' 'dumbbell workout,' and 'workout with weights' in the tags further cements this classification. Additionally, a secondary classification as 'Body weight' with a score of 0.5 is justified due to the inclusion of exercises like 'Tricep Pushups' and 'Plank Dumbbell Pass,' where body weight plays a significant role. The user comments also indicate the intense nature and strength focus of the workout, supporting these categories. The confidence level is very high given the explicit and consistent mentions of weights and full body strength focus in the metadata."
