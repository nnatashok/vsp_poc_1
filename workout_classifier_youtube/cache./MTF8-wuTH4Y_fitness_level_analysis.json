  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves various movements such as 'Goblet Squat + Pulse,' 'One Arm Thruster,' and 'Side Plank + Weight' which require moderate coordination and balance, indicative of Intermediate-level technique difficulty. Additionally, exercises like 'Superman Push Ups' and 'Elevated Split Squat' necessitate control and awareness, suggesting some Advanced elements. The use of dumbbells also adds complexity, placing the overall classification between Intermediate and Advanced.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of over 40 minutes and structure (50-60 seconds work with 10 seconds rest) signals a high energy expenditure and cardiovascular demand, thus it is rated Challenging. The intense pace, involving sustained work on large muscle groups, aligns with Extreme effort for deconditioned users. Terms like 'INTENSE,' 'burn calories,' and 'killer HIIT' from the tags and description support a high-effort classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Combining Intermediate to Advanced technique difficulty with Challenging to Extreme effort levels, the workout primarily targets Intermediate users, given its structure, and Advanced users due to its intensity and duration exceeding 40 minutes. Comments from users indicate that a range of simpler intensity modifications (e.g., using 3kg dumbbells) and pauses are feasible, suggesting flexibility in fitness level engagement. This versatile difficulty range allows inclusion of both Intermediate and Advanced levels."
