  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is explicitly titled 'NO EQUIPMENT', indicating that the routine does not require any equipment. This is reinforced by the tags and description which emphasize that the workout can be done 'ANYWHERE at ANYTIME' with 'no excuses,' further suggesting a bodyweight-only workout. Additionally, the workout is structured as a High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) routine, which typically relies on bodyweight exercises to achieve a comprehensive workout without the need for equipment. User comments do not mention any equipment being used, confirming the video's intent for a no-equipment workout. Therefore, the confidence level for needing no equipment is very high, between 0.8-1.0, due to the explicit indications present in the title and related metadata."
