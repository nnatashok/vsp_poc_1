  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises listed, such as dumbbell thrusters, bicep curls, and elbow plank, indicate a mix of basic to moderately complex movements. These exercises typically require some coordination and practice to maintain proper form, suggesting a technique difficulty of beginner to intermediate. The emphasis on 'good form and control' in the description suggests an elevated importance of technique beyond pure beginner exercises.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of 40 seconds of work followed by 20 seconds of rest over a duration of nearly 22 minutes. This structure, coupled with exercises involving weights, suggests a moderate to challenging effort level. The inclusion of exercises like push-ups, lunges, and plank assumes a level of intensity manageable by users with some fitness foundation.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique difficulty and effort involved, this workout is accessible to a broad range of fitness levels, from beginners (who may use lighter weights and take rests) to more experienced intermediate and advanced users, depending on how intensely they approach the workout. The recommendation for 'good form and control' slightly elevates the baseline fitness level required to safely engage in the workout, and since users can self-adjust weight intensity, multiple fitness levels are relevant."
