  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"5 Minute Guided Meditation for Gratitude | Mindful Movement\" is centered around a guided meditation practice. The metadata suggests that the video is designed to help viewers cultivate gratitude through mindfulness. There is no mention of any physical exercise that would require specific equipment. Meditation practices typically do not require any equipment, or at the most might suggest a comfortable space. There are no indications in the title, description, tags, or comments that imply the need for equipment like mats, chairs, or any other physical props often used in physical workout videos. Therefore, it appears this is a bodyweight-only meditation activity."
