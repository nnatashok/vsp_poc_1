  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled 'Guided Meditation for Children | Your Secret Treehouse | Relaxation for Kids' from the channel 'New Horizon - Meditation & Sleep Stories' clearly fits the vibe of 'The Deep Recharge' due to its focus on guiding children to a state of relaxation and tranquility. The description emphasizes creating a 'peaceful place', addressing 'stress, worry & anxiety' and inducing 'pure relaxation', which strongly aligns with the restorative and calming qualities of 'The Deep Recharge'. The use of 'guided meditation' as a central theme also supports this classification, earning a high confidence score of 0.85. \n\nThe vibe 'The Sleep Prep' is a strong secondary fit, given the video's focus on calming children's emotions and facilitating relaxation, which are integral to preparing for sleep. The phrase 're-establish feelings of tranquility' suggests a pre-sleep calming routine, thus justifying a score of 0.7. The video's metadata lacks any significant indicators of other vibes like 'The Meditative Grind' or 'The Zen Flow' as it's primarily oriented towards calming children for restful relaxation rather than active or structured meditative practices."
