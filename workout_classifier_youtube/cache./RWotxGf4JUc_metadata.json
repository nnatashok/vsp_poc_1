    "I have done maybe a hundred morning yoga video&#39;s this is one of the top 5 for me. thank you.",
    "That was the most difficult yoga I have ever done. But I\u2019m so happy to find your page cause I\u2019m trying this until I have full control",
    "Wow this was a different start of the day altogether. Only issue I want to ask, while in lunge, and pulling hand palms up, should my shoulders be very engaged or completely relaxed? Thanks coach. And go get that house across the lake!",
    "That pigeon stretch at the end was dynamite! Loved it!! Thanks Sean!"
