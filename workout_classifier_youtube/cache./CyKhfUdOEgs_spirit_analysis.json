  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified under the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit with extremely high confidence (1.0) due to explicit indicators in both the content and user feedback. The title, \"Mindfulness Meditation Body Scan,\" and tags such as \"mindfulness meditation\" and \"body scan\" clearly suggest a focus on relaxation and introspection, which are core elements of the Soothing & Restorative spirit. The description emphasizes a guided meditation session, aligning with practices designed for relaxation and healing. Comments further reinforce this classification, with mentions of \"gentle and expert guidance,\" \"helps me be calm,\" \"soft and gentle voice,\" and references to reduced stress levels. No indicators of intensity, complex structure, or physical activity are present to warrant consideration of other spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense,\" \"Sport & Agility,\" or \"Outdoor & Adventure.\" Therefore, the workout's spirit is best characterized as Soothing & Restorative."
