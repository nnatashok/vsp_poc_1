  "vibesExplanation": "The workout predominantly fits \"The Comfort Moves\" vibe, characterized by its gentle, inclusive, and supportive quality. The video targets postpartum mothers using babywearing techniques, encouraging safe and low-stress movement. The description and comments stress convenience, emotional support, and adaptability to a new mother's needs. Keywords like \"postpartum,\" \"babywearing,\" and \"mom and baby workout\" emphasize a focus on comfort and bonding with the baby, while ensuring mothers can exercise safely and effectively (score: 0.9 due to strong alignment).\n\nThe workout also mildly relates to \"The Reboot Workout\" through its potential to refresh and gently stretch the body post-birth. However, this vibe is secondary, with less emphasis on deep stretching or mobility work, indicated by moderate elements of recovery and refreshment (score: 0.5).\n\nOther potential vibes like \"The Meditative Grind\" or \"The Zen Flow\" are less applicable due to the dynamic movement involved and focus on functionality rather than grounding or breath-centered practices."
