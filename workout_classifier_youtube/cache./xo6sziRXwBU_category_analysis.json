  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned to the workout is 'Pilates' with a score of 0.9. This is strongly supported by the video title which includes 'full body pilates workout' and the channel's description indicating that the creator is a certified Pilates instructor. The use of terms like 'de-bloating & flexibility' in the title suggests a focus on Pilates' well-known benefits of improving flexibility and mobility.\n\nA secondary category is 'Stretching', with a score of 0.6. Although the primary focus is on Pilates, the description emphasizes 'increased mobility, flexibility,' suggesting that some stretching elements are likely present in the routine.\n\nThe comments reinforce the Pilates classification, with users frequently mentioning that they perform these Pilates workouts regularly and appreciate the calming effect, which aligns with Pilates characteristics. The overall confidence in classification is high due to explicit references in both the title and the channel's purpose."
