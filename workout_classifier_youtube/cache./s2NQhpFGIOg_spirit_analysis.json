  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' due to its emphasis on relaxation, stress reduction, and gentle entry into yoga for beginners, as indicated by terms like 'beginner's yoga routine,' 'soothing vibrations,' and reference to calming practices like 'Shavasana' and 'pranayama.' The description focuses on using yoga to channel energy positively, emphasizing stress reduction through practices meant to boost immunity and aid in mental peace. These aspects contribute to a high confidence in the 'Soothing & Restorative' classification (0.8).\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also present, scoring 0.6, due to the structured yet continuous sequence of yoga postures like 'Surya Namaskar' and the rhythmic breathing exercises such as 'Anulom Vilom' and 'Kapalbhati,' typical of yoga routines that harness the flow of movement and breath.\n\nThe exclusion of other spirits is based on the lack of high-energy intensity, precise athleticism, or adventure-based elements typical of categories like 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Sport & Agility,' or 'Outdoor & Adventure.' The video consistently focuses on gentle physical and mental healing."
