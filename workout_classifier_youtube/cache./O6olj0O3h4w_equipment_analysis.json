  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout described in the metadata for the '15 Minute Gentle BEGINNERS HIIT Workout' appears to require no equipment. The description lists exercises such as 'March on the spot', 'Side stars', 'Butt kick punches', 'Sumo squats', and similar bodyweight movements. There is no mention of equipment like dumbbells, resistance bands, or mats, which would be common for such exercises if they were needed. Additionally, the tags include 'kettlebell', but this seems to be part of broader tagging strategies rather than an indication of required equipment for this particular workout. Hence, it is classified as a bodyweight-only workout."
