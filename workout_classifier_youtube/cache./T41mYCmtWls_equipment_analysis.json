  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"10 min Morning Yoga Stretch for Beginners - Energy Boost Yoga\" explicitly states in the description that \"No props needed.\" This indicates that the workout can be performed without any physical equipment and is likely to focus on bodyweight and flexibility exercises typical of yoga. Even though the description mentions that a block could be used to make some poses more accessible, it clarifies that this is optional and not required for the workout. The absence of specific equipment mentions in both the title and the detailed description further supports the conclusion that no equipment is essential for this routine. Thus, the confidence is very high (0.8-1.0) that no equipment is necessary, confirming that the workout is bodyweight only."
