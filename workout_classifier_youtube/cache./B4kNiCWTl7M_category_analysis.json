  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under the 'Yoga' category with a very high confidence score of 0.9. This is supported by explicit mentions in the title, description, and tags, such as 'gentle yoga practice,' 'vinyasa yoga,' and 'yoga flow.' The channel, 'Breathe and Flow,' specializes in various yoga practices, further reinforcing this classification. Additionally, the video is geared towards a 'full body gentle yoga practice for beginners,' which aligns with typical yoga routines focusing on stretching and flexibility. \n\nThe 'Stretching' category is considered with a moderate score of 0.5 because the description emphasizes recovery, and comments highlight improvements in flexibility and relief from muscle tension, which are common goals of stretching. However, given the strong yoga focus, stretching is a secondary characteristic. Other categories like 'Pilates' or 'Meditation' are excluded because the metadata strongly centers around yoga, with no specific mention of breathing exercises or meditation techniques."
