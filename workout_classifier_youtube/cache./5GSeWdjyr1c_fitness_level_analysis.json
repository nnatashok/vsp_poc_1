  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The guided meditation by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche involves simple instructions to bring awareness to the body, sensory experience, and awareness itself. This presents a Technique Difficulty predominantly at the Beginner level, as meditation does not involve physical movements or complex coordination, and can be performed by following the guided instructions with ease. There is a minor consideration for Intermediate due to the depth of focus required, which new practitioners might find slightly challenging.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the light effort and beginner technique required by the guided meditation, the Required Fitness Level is predominantly Beginner. This session does not demand prior physical fitness or extensive experience and is accessible to those new to meditation. Intermediate consideration is marginally considered for users exploring deeper levels of awareness. The meditation's accessibility and non-demanding nature endorse it as suitable for wide audience engagement at the Beginner level, while a minimal Intermediate consideration reflects the focus needed for deeper introspection."
