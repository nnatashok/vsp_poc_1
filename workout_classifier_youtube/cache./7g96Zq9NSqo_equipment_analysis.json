  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a guided meditation focused on healing and recovery. The metadata, including the title, description, tags, and comments, emphasizes meditation, mindfulness, and the mental benefits of the practice. No references to physical exercises or equipment are present. Furthermore, the discussion and intent of the video suggest a calm, introspective activity centered on mental well-being, which typically does not require any physical equipment. Therefore, this meditation appears to be a bodyweight-only session, requiring no physical exercise equipment."
