  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Breathing exercises' with a high score of 0.9. This is evidenced by multiple explicit references to breathwork across all metadata fields:\n- The video title, 'Advanced Guided Breathing For Maximum Focus,' directly indicates a focus on breathing techniques.\n- The description highlights offerings related to breathwork courses and guided sessions, emphasizing the role of breathing in the video's content.\n- The channel description and owner's background further establish a strong focus on breathwork.\n- Comments frequently mention improvements in focus and comparisons to the Wim Hof method, a known breathing technique.\n\n'Meditation' is considered as a secondary category with a score of 0.3 due to the comments emphasizing improvements in calmness and mental clarity, attributes often associated with meditative practices. However, since the video primarily features breath-focused content, 'Breathing exercises' is more fitting. Other categories like 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were dismissed due to lack of relevant cues."
