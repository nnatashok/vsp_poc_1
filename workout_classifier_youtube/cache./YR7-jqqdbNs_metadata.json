    "Best stretching video I have ever followed after a workout. No music, birds tweet, and constant form corrections. You can even sense mindfulness. Grateful to have discovered this channel. Thank you for your efforts.",
    "I&#39;m amazed at the progress in my fitness journey ever since finding this channel and consistently practicing with both of you. As always, thank you all so much!",
    "Thanks",
    "After years of body image issues and eating addiction, I took a long break from the gym. Today I had my first real workout since, trying to get back into routine. But this time, more healed, more present and as a unit instead of fighting against myself. This routine was exactly what I needed after my workout. Not only stretching but nice words too. Felt like a hug. Thank you! Will keep integrating your videos"
