    "I used to play gymnastics for 3 years when I was a kid but now I&#39;m 22 years old and I mostly do cardio , HIIT and a bit of weight lifting <br>For some reason I can never be able to do a full push up despite being in an overall healthy weight <br>I don&#39;t have enough arm muscle <br>However after doing this workout for 3 weeks now I can finally see some sort of progress in my push ups <br>So thank you really",
    "I feel so weak after the second go on this bastard of a workout. I did gymnastics in my teens. Over 40 now. In a weird way this workout, and especially the instructor, have me motivated in my weakness. Love it! Thank you so much!",
    "Finally a longer workout routine I&#39;ve been doing the 15 minutes version for so long it got too easy for me but, luckily you made a longer and harder one\ud83d\ude0a"
