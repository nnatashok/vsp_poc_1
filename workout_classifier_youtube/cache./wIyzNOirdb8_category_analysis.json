  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Weight workout,' given the explicit emphasis on using dumbbells for strength exercises. The title ('10-Minute Seated Dumbbell Strength Workout for Seniors') and description both highlight the use of light resistance through dumbbells, clearly indicating a focus on weight training. This category is assigned a high score of 0.9 due to the clear and central role that weights play in the exercises. \n\n'Body weight' is included as a secondary category with a lower score of 0.2, as some exercises\u2014such as marching on the spot or leg raises\u2014may not explicitly require dumbbells and can involve bodyweight movements. However, this is not the central focus and is thus given a minimal score.\n\nOther categories like 'Mat' or 'Calisthenics' were not considered as the workout is seated using dumbbells, and there's no significant focus on aerobic or flexible movements fitting those categories. The 'Stretching' category is also not applicable, as there is only a minor focus on stretches at the end of the workout for cooldown purposes."
