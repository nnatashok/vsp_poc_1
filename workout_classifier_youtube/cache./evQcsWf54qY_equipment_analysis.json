  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title and description explicitly mention a 'full-body mat workout,' indicating that a mat is central to executing the exercises comfortably, especially since it is a low-impact, bodyweight-focused routine. Tags like 'full body mat workout' and the emphasis on being 'gentle' and 'low impact' suggest that floor exercises are a significant part of the workout, further supporting the use of a mat. The confidence score is set at 0.9 due to the direct and frequent mentions of a mat in the metadata."
