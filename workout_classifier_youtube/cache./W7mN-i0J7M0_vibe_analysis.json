  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe assigned is \"The Progression Quest\" with a strong score of 0.9. This is due to the focus on weight gain and tracking progress over time, as highlighted in the video description and comments where viewers mention improvements and logging their weight changes. This reflects a methodical, incremental approach to fitness goals, particularly as gaining weight for many can be a long-term improvement process. Additionally, the title emphasizes 'INTENSE Weight Gain Workout,' suggesting a focused, consistent effort in achieving the fitness goal, aligning with the pursuit of progression.\n\nThe second vibe, \"The Groove Session,\" is assigned a lower score of 0.6. Comments indicate a light-hearted and fun approach to working out, as viewers appreciate the trainer 'joking around,' which makes the workout enjoyable and expressive. This aligns with the vibe of being expressive and in the moment. The use of music from NoCopyrightSounds adds a layer of musical engagement.\n\nOther vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" were considered due to the word 'intense,' but the overall workout and community description steer toward progression and enjoyment rather than pure intensity."
