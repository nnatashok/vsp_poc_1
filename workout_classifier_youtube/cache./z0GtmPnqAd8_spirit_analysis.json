  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is predominantly characterized by the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to its focus on stress reduction, grounding, and healing. The title, 'Guided Meditation | Strength & Grounding In Stressful Times,' along with tags like 'meditation for anxiety,' 'healing meditation,' and 'stress meditation,' strongly indicate the restorative aspects. The description further reinforces this by emphasizing relaxation, positivity, and peace, aiming to relieve anxiety and stress, which align with the 'Soothing & Restorative' category, thus achieving a perfect score of 1 in this spirit.\n\nAdditionally, there is a mild match with the 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit (score: 0.5) as the meditation guides the viewer through a continuous, mindful journey. This aspect of smoothness and connection is implicit in guided meditations where flow is established through rhythmic breathing and visualization, but it's secondary to the primary aim of healing and relaxation. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the lack of physical exertion or athletic focus in the video. Overall, confidence in this classification is very high (0.95) based on explicit indicators."
