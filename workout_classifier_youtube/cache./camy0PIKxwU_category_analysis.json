  "categoriesExplanation": "The video was primarily classified as 'Yoga' because it is explicitly labeled as a 'gentle yoga routine' in both the title and description. This suggests the session adheres to typical yoga practices, focusing on postures and flows that align with the channel's description of specializing in yoga, particularly vinyasa flow. The channel owner, Charlie, is described as an experienced yoga instructor, further solidifying this classification. The high score of 0.9 reflects strong confidence based on multiple explicit mentions.\n\nThe secondary classification of 'Stretching' is due to the emphasis on 'full body stretches' and 'gentle series of postures' as noted in the description and user comments. While stretching is a significant component, the core focus remains on yoga practices, evident from terms used like 'yoga flow' and 'postures.' The score of 0.6 denotes that stretching is a notable, though not primary, aspect of the routine.\n\nThis analysis is consistent with user comments highlighting relaxation and restorative goals typical of gentle yoga, with specific mentions of 'savasana' and 'spine' stretching, which bridges yoga and overall flexibility enhancement."
