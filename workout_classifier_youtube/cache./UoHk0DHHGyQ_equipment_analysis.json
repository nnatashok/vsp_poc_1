  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a yoga practice titled 'Morning Energy Yoga | 20 Minutes | All levels,' indicating a focus on yoga exercises. The description and tags suggest a yoga routine, including phrases like 'yoga flow,' 'yoga for energy,' and 'yoga practice,' all of which typically require a mat for floor exercises and stability during postures. Although no specific mention of a mat is found in the description, it is common knowledge that mats are essential for performing yoga safely and comfortably, especially when engaging in poses as indicated ('might practice many asanas'). Therefore, there is a high confidence (0.9) that a mat is needed for this workout."
