  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for the video titled \"The Powerful Release of Letting Go! Guided Meditation\" suggests that it is a guided meditation session. The title, tags, and description focus on concepts such as letting go, meditation, and spiritual practice. There is no indication of physical exercise or mention of any workout equipment. The comments reflect personal growth, healing, and mindset changes without reference to any physical activities that require equipment. Therefore, it appears the session is bodyweight only, focusing on mental and emotional aspects rather than physical exercise. As such, no physical equipment is necessary for this video."
