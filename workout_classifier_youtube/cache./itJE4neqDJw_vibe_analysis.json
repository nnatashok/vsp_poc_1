  "vibesExplanation": "The video's focus on a 'daily stretch for tight muscles, mobility & flexibility' strongly aligns with the characteristics of 'The Reboot Workout,' which emphasizes deep stretch and low stress. This vibe is supported by the title, description, and tags that highlight daily flexibility and mobility routines. Since the workout is described as 'quick' and suitable to add into a morning or nighttime routine, it suggests a revitalizing, refresh aspect, hence scoring a 0.8.\n\nAdditionally, the video's calming and grounding nature, suitable for starting the day or winding down before bed, correlates well with 'The Zen Flow.' The mention of 'breath-centered' in the vibe description is reflected in the video comments about narration aiding focus and the calming effect described by users, warranting a score of 0.7.\n\nAlternative vibes like 'The Comfort Moves' were considered but not chosen due to the focus on flexibility improvements rather than exclusively low-intensity or seated movement, which are better represented by 'The Reboot Workout'."
