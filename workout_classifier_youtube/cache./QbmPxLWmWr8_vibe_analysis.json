  "vibesExplanation": "The video's focus on a 'super sweaty' cardio workout with no jumping suggests a vibe of 'The Endorphin Wave' due to its emphasis on steady, aerobic exercise leading to heightened energy and feel-good movement. The title and description highlight the workout as intense ('intense cardio at home'), which aligns with the gradual build-up and elevated energy typical of this vibe. The fact that it's apartment-friendly without jumps indicates a sustained movement pattern without high-impact bursts, which supports this classification with a score of 0.7.\n\nThe comments praising the workout for making participants feel energetic and breathless suggest a repetitive, enduring effort, indicative of 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The comment about flexibility and relieving aches alludes to movement repetition and focus, justifying a moderate score of 0.5. While the workout is cardio, the lack of jumping and equipment usage implies a repetition-based structure common in endurance-focused sessions.\n\nOther vibes such as 'The Groove Session' or 'The Warrior Workout' were considered but excluded due to the specific mention of no jumping and the cardio focus, rather than high-impact or dance-like expressions."
