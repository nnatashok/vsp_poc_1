  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified under the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit with a very high confidence score of 0.9. The workout is a HIIT routine, which is typically high-intensity, as explicitly indicated by the title ('25 MIN FULL BODY HIIT ROUTINE'), designed to burn up to 500 calories, suggesting vigorous exercise involvement. Comments such as 'really very effective' and mention of considerable fat burn further support this classification. The second spirit identified is 'Structured & Disciplined' with a confidence score of 0.7. The structure is evident from the specific workout format outlined: '30 Sec ON, 20 Sec OFF, 2 Minute Break between Rounds', repeated multiple times, indicating a disciplined, repetitive structure critical to this workout style. Other spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the nature of HIIT being non-therapeutic and highly regimented rather than free-flowing or soothing. Overall, the metadata strongly supports a high-energy and structured approach."
