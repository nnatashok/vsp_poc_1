  "categoriesExplanation": "The video titled \"Pilates for Beginners - 15 Minute Beginner Pilates Workout\" is explicitly described as a Pilates workout designed for beginners. Both the title and the description emphasize a \"beginner Pilates workout,\" highlighting the exercise type as Pilates. The tags further reinforce this focus, with terms like \"beginner core workout,\" \"gentle pilates,\" and \"basic pilates\". The comments consistently mention the benefits and suitability of the workout for beginners, indicating that the intensity level is appropriate for new practitioners, which is typical of Pilates exercises aimed at entry-level participants. All evidence strongly supports this classification, resulting in a high confidence level of 0.9 for the Pilates category. No other categories were considered, as the video clearly focuses exclusively on Pilates exercises without any additional forms of workout included."
