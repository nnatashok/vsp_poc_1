  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as \"Structured & Disciplined\" due to its methodical approach with a fixed timer (40 seconds work, 20 seconds rest) for each exercise, emphasized by phrases like \"no repeat\" and \"compound movements.\" The description lists several specific exercises targeting different muscle groups (e.g., chest press, renegade row, squats), indicating a technical and structured routine. This lends to a high confidence of 0.75. The \"High-Energy & Intense\" spirit is also present as indicated by the workout's fast-paced 20-minute format with compound exercises that engage multiple muscle groups simultaneously, aiming for hypertrophy and muscle building, which suggests a high intensity level. This is supported by comments emphasizing results from frequent repeat sessions and the need for consistency, achieving a score of 0.7. Other spirits were not selected as the workout lacks elements characteristic of Flow & Rhythm, Soothing & Restorative, Sport & Agility, and Outdoor & Adventure."
