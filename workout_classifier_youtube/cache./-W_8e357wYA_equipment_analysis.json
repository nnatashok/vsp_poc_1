  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata consistently emphasizes that this workout is designed specifically for a treadmill.

Similarly, the description frequent references to running on a treadmill and controlling speeds and incline settings, confirm its central role. Tags such as \"Treadmill Workout\" and \"30 Minute Treadmill Workout\" further underline the necessity of a treadmill. Therefore, the confidence is very high (0.95) that a treadmill is the required equipment for this workout."
