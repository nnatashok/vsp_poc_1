  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned to this video is 'Stretching' with a score of 0.8. This is due to multiple indicators in the metadata suggesting a strong focus on flexibility and mobility exercises, particularly tailored for golfers. The video is described as a 'golf focused mobility routine' aiming to improve flexibility in key areas like the hip through internal and external rotation, and the spine. The tags heavily emphasize terms such as 'golf flexibility', 'golf stretches', and 'stretching for golf', all pointing towards stretching as a core component of the workout. \n\nThe secondary category is 'Other', with a score of 0.3, reflecting the specific adaptation of stretching exercises for golfers, which might not fit typical stretching routines due to its sport-specific nature. The inclusion of terms and comments related to golf-specific fitness suggests that while stretching is predominant, there is a specialization towards improving conditions beneficial for golfing, justifying the inclusion of 'Other' as a minor categorization."
