  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled \"20 MIN FULL BODY PILATES WORKOUT FOR BEGINNERS - (REALISTIC AT HOME PILATES),\" and the description explicitly states \"I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS NO EQUIPMENT WORKOUT DESIGNED FOR EVERYBODY.\" This clearly indicates that the workout is intended to be performed without any additional equipment. None of the tags or comments suggest the use of specific equipment, and the emphasis is on accessibility and ease for beginners. Therefore, this workout is designed to be a bodyweight-only Pilates session, void of any added equipment requirements."
