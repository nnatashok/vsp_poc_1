  "vibesExplanation": "The selected workout vibes are primarily influenced by the focus on flexibility, gentle movement, and relaxation. 'The Reboot Workout' is a strong match (score 0.9) due to the emphasis on a full-body stretch routine aimed at refreshing the body, as indicated by the words 'flexibility' and 'great stretch' in the title and description. The duration and follow-along nature support a relaxing, low-stress session typical of this vibe.\n\nThe second vibe, 'The Zen Flow' (score 0.8), aligns well because the routine is breath-centered and unhurried, targeting relaxation and mindfulness, as suggested by user comments about balance and letting go, and the routine's calming intent echoed in descriptions and channel themes.\n\nLastly, 'The Comfort Moves' (score 0.6) was considered due to the beginner-friendly approach targeting individuals who are inflexible, providing a safe and accessible workout experience.\n\nIntense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush' were excluded due to the focus on calm, gentle stretching rather than intense or heart-pounding activity."
