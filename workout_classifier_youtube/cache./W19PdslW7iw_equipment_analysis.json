  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"15 Minute Guided Meditation To Find Peace In Uncertain Times\" is primarily focused on meditation, as indicated by the title and consistent references in the description and tags. The metadata suggests that the session is a guided meditation practice designed to manage stress and anxiety, typical of bodyweight-only activities. The description encourages viewers to find a quiet space, wear headphones, and close their eyes, without any mention of physical exercises or additional equipment. The lack of keywords or tags suggesting the incorporation of physical props or equipment common in other types of workouts indicates that no particular fitness equipment is necessary. Therefore, this meditation guide does not require any physical equipment typically used in workouts, as it is purely a mental exercise. Consequently, the analysis concludes that the workout is bodyweight only, and no equipment is required."
