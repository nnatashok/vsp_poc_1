  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The equipment required for this workout is explicitly stated in both the video title and description. The title '20 MINUTE FULL BODY WORKOUT (DUMBBELLS ONLY)' clearly indicates that dumbbells are the sole piece of equipment needed. This is reinforced in the description, which mentions 'A dumbbell only full body workout.' The tags also heavily focus on dumbbells with mentions such as 'dumbbell workout,' 'dumbbell full body workout,' and 'workout with weights.' Additionally, the top comments discuss specific exercises like 'DB CURL SQUATS,' 'DB CLEAN & PRESS,' and 'SINGLE DB SNATCH,' all of which require dumbbells. Based on this comprehensive evidence, the confidence level for needing dumbbells is very high (1.0). No other equipment is suggested or implied in the metadata."
