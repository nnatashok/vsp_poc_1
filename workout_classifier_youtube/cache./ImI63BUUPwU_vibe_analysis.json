  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is characterized primarily by consistent, repetitive, and steady movements that align with 'The Meditative Grind' vibe. The emphasis on maintaining a low, but continuous effort without rest breaks suggests an experience of getting lost in the repetition, typical of LISS (Low-Intensity Steady State) workouts. This is further supported by language in the description like \"steady state cardio\" and \"continuous, maintainable level of effort.\" This matches the vibe reliably with a score of 0.75.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe fits due to the mention of mood boosting and the elevated heart rate, as highlighted in comments such as \"Great for rest days... keeps the heart rate up,\" and \"Do not let the 'low impact' fool you! You are STILL gonna sweat.\" These suggest a feel-good, steady energy flow during the workout, supportive of a 0.7 score.\n\nLastly, the workout also lightly aligns with 'The Groove Session' vibe, due to its fluidity and expressiveness, albeit without the dance-centric elements. The absence of high-intensity intervals and the inclusion of smooth, low-impact transitions among the exercises support a moderate classification under this vibe, scoring 0.6."
