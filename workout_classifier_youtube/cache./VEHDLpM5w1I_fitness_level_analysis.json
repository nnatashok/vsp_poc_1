  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves a variety of exercises, some of which require coordination and body awareness: goblet squats, sumo squats with press, RDLs, and side plank with knee pull. These suggest an Intermediate level due to the need for balance and coordination. Advanced techniques are also present such as V-sit Arnold press and dumbbell swings. The presence of compound and combination movements indicates a significant technique requirement.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 30-minute duration with 24 non-repeating exercises, each for 45 seconds with 20 seconds rest, demands a sustained effort with minimal recovery. This structure, combined with moderately heavy weight lifting, places the effort difficulty at a Challenging level, especially for those with low fitness. Mentions of increased intensity and the descriptor 'challenging' align with this level. Moderate effort difficulty is also considered due to adjustable weights and potential modifications.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering both technique and effort levels, the workout is best suited for those at an Intermediate to Advanced fitness level. The need to handle moderate to heavy weights safely and the compound movements require a base level of fitness and body awareness. The structure and duration exclude Beginner level suitability. Comments suggest that even users with some physical limitations can partake, but modifications would likely be essential, confirming the Intermediate level inclusion."
