  "categoriesExplanation": "The main category assigned is 'Treadmill' with a very high confidence score of 0.9. The metadata explicitly mentions 'treadmill workout', 'follow along treadmill run', and 'treadmill follow along workout' in both the title and tags. Moreover, the video is categorized under a '60 MIN ENDURANCE CHALLENGE | Treadmill Follow Along!' session which emphasizes its treadmill-based nature.\n\nFurthermore, the 'Running' category is also relevant and given a score of 0.7. The tags and description mention running, with keywords like 'indoor running cardio workout', 'running treadmill workout for beginners', and 'calorie burn running workout'. The channel, IBX Running, focuses on running, supporting this classification.\n\nCategories such as 'HIIT' could have been considered, but given the primary focus on treadmill running and the keywords aligning strongly with running and treadmill categories, they were excluded. Additionally, the description mentions 'run and recovery intervals', which suggests variation in activity but does not clearly align with classic HIIT sessions which focus more on short, intense bursts of activity."
