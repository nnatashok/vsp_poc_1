  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "This video is a guided meditation session, requiring little to no physical movement or coordination, thus classifying the technique difficulty as Beginner with a very high score. Meditation generally involves simple instructions such as sitting still, listening, and focusing inward, which are not complex to execute and require minimal physical coordination. The descriptors in the metadata, including terms like 'peaceful state', and viewer comments focusing on emotional and mental release, further support this classification. The technique difficulty of meditating with guidance from a video is elementary, especially given the lack of any physical component in the metadata.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.95,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This session involves a guided meditation lasting 28 minutes, with no physical exertion required. Meditation is inherently low in physical effort, focusing instead on mental relaxation and mindfulness. The metadata discusses emotional release rather than physical activity, and terms in both the description and tags emphasize 'letting go' and 'peace' rather than any form of physical strain. Therefore, the effort difficulty is rated as Light, as the session is about mental engagement and relaxation rather than physical exertion.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.9,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique difficulty of Beginner and effort difficulty of Light, the Required Fitness Level is primarily Beginner, suitable for anyone including those in poor physical condition. However, meditation can be psychologically challenging in terms of maintaining focus and managing emotional engagement, making it relevant for Intermediate level as well. Some comments hint at users finding significant emotional benefits and challenges, suggesting a moderate alignment with the Intermediate level for those ready to engage deeply with emotional and mental processes during meditations. Thus, incorporating a mild score for Intermediate reflects the cognitive commitment involved without physical strain."
