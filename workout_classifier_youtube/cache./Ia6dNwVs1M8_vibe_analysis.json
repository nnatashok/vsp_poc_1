  "vibesExplanation": "The primary workout vibe, 'The Comfort Moves' (0.9), is strongly supported by the metadata. The video's focus on first trimester pregnancy exercises is explicitly safe and gentle, aligning well with a 'safe, cozy, feel-good movement' vibe necessary for prenatal fitness, as indicated by phrases like 'safe modifications' and 'designed to relieve nausea.' The high view count and positive comments from diverse locations emphasize its calming and supportive nature, which matches this vibe perfectly.\n\nThe secondary vibe, 'The Reboot Workout' (0.7), ties in with the nature of these exercises providing 'more energy' and a total-body refresh, crucial in early pregnancy when dealing with fatigue and morning sickness, as stated in the description.\n\nFinally, 'The Foundation Builder' (0.5) reflects the workout's contribution to strengthening the body for pregnancy, as seen in comments highlighting the aim to 'keep my body strong and my mind calm.' The methodical approach to safely adapting exercise to different pregnancy stages also suggests foundational strengthening, albeit to a lesser extent."
