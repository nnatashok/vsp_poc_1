  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "I know a lot of people ask for longer videos, but I really appreciate these quicker sessions in the weekly regimen! They\u2019re easier to fit into a busy schedule. And I find that consistently doing your 20-30 min videos, with a 40-minute one on weekends, even more effective than the long workouts I used to do sporadically on my own.",
    "This video came out at the exact moment I had my monthly sudden motivation to become a Victoria\u2019s Secret model.",
    "the &quot;now let&#39;s reverse&quot; kills me every time",
    "This is my second day ! I feel way better mentally already! I\u2019m gonna try to do it for 2 weeks AT LEAST so i wanted to document my progress on here. PLS LIKE AND REMIND ME!",
    "Who knew 20 minutes could be so painful. Thank you for introducing to at home Pilates! I love it so much"
