    "I work as a substance abuse counselor\u00a0at an inpatient facility and do your meditations with the women once a week. They are so grateful for this and look forward to it all week. You&#39;re helping in many ways you may not even realize:) Thank you!",
    "My heart goes out to everyone in need of this meditation. A positive thought I always try to remember during hard times, is that everything always turns out okay in the end. It might take time, and the solution isn&#39;t always what you expect. But please know that times always get better. And in the end, you will look back to this time and be happier and wiser. Peace and love to you all",
    "I always say that I can&#39;t wait for the day when I break free of this anxiety that tortures and mocks me everyday of my life. You said &quot;There is a sudden rush of freedom&quot;, and I sobbed. I will recommend this video to as many that I know who suffer from anxiety. Thank you for opening my heart and for all you help. \ud83d\udc9c",
    "I must have listened to this at bedtime sooo many times over the last 5 years. I can honestly say that I think it has saved my life. It&#39;s beautiful. Thank you! Xxxx"
