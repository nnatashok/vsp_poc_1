  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative' due to its focus on accommodating pregnant women and easing the delivery process, as highlighted by phrases in the title like \"Easy Delivery\" and the emphasis on hip openers, and pelvic floor work mentioned in the description. This aligns with the spirit's emphasis on gentle, healing sessions. The score of 0.8 reflects very high confidence given the explicit indicators of relaxation and support for pregnancy. Additionally, 'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant as there is a mention of 'routine with a little of everything' which suggests smooth, continuous movement. This spirit is supported by the mention of cardiovascular elements and coordination-based exercises like asymmetrical poses, though the emphasis seems slightly less pronounced than the restorative focus, justifying a 0.6 score. 'High-Energy & Intense' and other high-intensity variants were excluded as the workout is tailored for pregnancy, focusing more on gentle and adaptable movements than intense exertion."
