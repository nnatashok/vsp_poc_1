  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a yoga practice titled 'Morning Yoga Flow | 20-Minute Morning Yoga Practice', which strongly suggests the need for a mat, as mats are typically used in yoga for comfort and stability during poses. This is further supported by the tags such as 'morning yoga', 'home yoga', and 'free yoga videos', indicating a typical yoga setting where mats are essential. The description emphasizes a 'juicy breath-centric morning flow', which often involves mat-based poses like child's pose, as noted in one of the top comments. Therefore, based on the common association of yoga with mats, there is a very high confidence score of 0.95 that a mat is required for this workout."
