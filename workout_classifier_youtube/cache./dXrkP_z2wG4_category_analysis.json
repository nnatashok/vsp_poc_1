  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary focus of this video is on \"Guided Meditation,\" explicitly mentioned in the title, description, and tags such as 'guided meditation,' 'meditate,' and 'meditation.' This indicates a very high confidence (0.9) in classifying the workout under the 'Meditation' category. The video's purpose is to guide the listener into a relaxed state of awareness for spiritual interaction, strongly aligning with meditation practices that enhance mindfulness and focus. \n\nAdditionally, while the video does not explicitly detail breathing exercises, meditation practices often include controlled breathing as a component to aid relaxation and focus, which suggests a minor presence of 'Breathing exercises' (score 0.4). The description advises getting into a relaxed state, indirectly suggesting breathing may be part of the process. Other potential categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were excluded as there is no indication of physical postures or flexibility focus related to those categories."
