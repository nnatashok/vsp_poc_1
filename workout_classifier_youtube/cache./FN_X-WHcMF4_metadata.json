    "Hope you guys enjoyed doing this lower body stretch with me! \u2764\ufe0f Would you like to see more stretching videos? Leave your requests below! Xx - Maddie",
    "I\u2019m a dude who works out and never stretches... this is a workout itself for me!! Can\u2019t believe how hard these stretches were!",
    "I am not even being dramatic when I say this routine is life changing. I do weight lifting and feel like my legs are never not sore; they constantly hurt. I am constantly stretching, but this routine is so much more effective than anything I could come up with on my own.",
    "This is the best stretching routine on the whole internet, I swear",
    "Omg this was amazing!! You should do one for upper body too, specifically shoulders!! Thank you so much, this helped a ton :)"
