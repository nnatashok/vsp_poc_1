    "I&#39;m using an Elliptical Cross Trainer! This hit me real good. I did it with Level 10 Resistance level, Really tried so hard. Completed it! My Thighs were burning so badly. After done the cooldown was so refreshing and cooling honestly, It felt i could go on forever... Thanks for the great workout! Will be doing this everyday!",
