  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises in the workout are described as suitable for beginners and seniors, implying straightforward movements more aligned with a Beginner technique difficulty. The description mentions basic dumbbell exercises performed while lying on the mat and in a seated position, which generally require minimal coordination or balance, suitable for those new to strength training. The instructional format offers modifications, such as performing exercises seated instead of on hands and knees, further supporting accessibility for beginners. Considering both the simplicity of exercises and accommodations for low mobility, the classification is strongly aligned with Beginner and mildly with Intermediate due to the use of dumbbells.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a 'strength-building workout for seniors and beginners,' suggesting a Light effort difficulty, especially given the SeniorShape Fitness channel's focus. The 23-minute duration and use of light weights infer low-to-moderate energy expenditure, particularly as the exercises are performed on the mat or seated. User comments and channel focus reinforce that this routine aims at maintaining strength rather than intense energy burns. The set structure with rest periods implied by comments and the type of exercises suggests that it's accessible and not too demanding, though a small Moderate score is possible due to the consistent workout duration beyond 20 minutes.",

The channel description notes a focus on routines for beginners and older adults, providing further support for this classification. The workout's length and the involvement of dumbbells allow for a degree of adjustable effort, contributing to a secondary alignment with Intermediate users who may use heavier weights or extended duration for increased intensity."
