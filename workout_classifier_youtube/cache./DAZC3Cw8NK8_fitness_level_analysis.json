  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout primarily consists of basic movements such as Body Rotations, Torso Twists, and Squat Arm Lifts, which are straightforward and require minimal coordination, aligning with a Beginner level. Some exercises like Lunges and High Knee Jacks suggest a small degree of coordination, justifying a slight push towards Intermediate.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as 'fun and easy,' with exercises that have low-intensity impacts and incorporate rest periods, indicative of a Light effort difficulty. However, due to its 21-minute duration and full-body engagement, it can also be seen as slightly more exertive, thus partially fitting a Moderate classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the Beginner-friendly exercises and the Light effort level, the video is strongly suited for Beginners looking to start exercising. The extended duration and inclusion of some slightly more challenging movements, like Lunges, mildly support an Intermediate level for those with a bit more fitness experience."
