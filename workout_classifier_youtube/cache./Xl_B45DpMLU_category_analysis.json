  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under 'Meditation' with a high score of 0.9, based on explicit indicators in the title, description, and tags. The title 'Daily Calm | 10 Minute Mindfulness Meditation | Self Soothing' clearly specifies that the content is a 'mindfulness meditation' session. The description further confirms this as it mentions being a 'Daily Calm mindfulness meditation' guided by Tamara Levitt, intended as a 'self soothing practice'. The tags include 'meditation', 'mindfulness', 'relax', and 'calm', all reinforcing the focus on meditation.\n\nThe secondary category 'Breathing exercises' is included with a lower score of 0.3. This is speculative as meditation can sometimes naturally integrate breathing techniques, but there is no explicit evidence from the metadata specifically highlighting breathing exercises apart from potential practices during the meditation session. The presence of calming, self-soothing practices suggests the involvement of breathing techniques, albeit this remains secondary to meditation.\n\nThe calm and mindfulness meditation themes are consistently reflected across the video's metadata, leading to a very high confidence level of 0.95 for these categorization choices."
