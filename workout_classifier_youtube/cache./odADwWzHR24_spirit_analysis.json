  "spiritsExplanation": "The predominant spirit of the video 'Relieve Stress & Anxiety with Simple Breathing Techniques' is 'Soothing & Restorative'. This classification is strongly supported by the video title, which highlights stress and anxiety relief, a core aspect of soothing and restorative activities. The description emphasizes the use of breathing techniques like Square and Pursed breathing, which are known for their calming effects, further indicating a focus on relaxation and mental wellness.\n\nThe tags such as 'relaxing breathing', 'stress relief', and 'calm breathing' all suggest a restorative intent, which is to alleviate stress and promote a sense of calm. The high engagement and positive comments like \"this video is genuinely saving me\" reinforce the video\u2019s effectiveness in providing relaxation and stress reduction, which aligns perfectly with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit.\n\nThe confidence level for this analysis is very high (0.95) due to the clear alignment of the video's content and its intended effects with soothing, relaxation, and anxiety relief. Other spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility', are clearly inappropriate given the context and purpose of the video."
