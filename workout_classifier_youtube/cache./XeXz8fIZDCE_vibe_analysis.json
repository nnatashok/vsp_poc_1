The title and content hint at grounding, intentional practice through yoga, emphasizing listening to your body and at-your-own-pace approach, typical of unhurried and breath-centered practices.\n\n'Comfort Moves' is also relevant due to the safe and gentle nature of the exercises aimed at alleviating back pain. The repeated mention of 'gentle' yoga practice aligns with the safe and cozy elements of this vibe, justifying a 0.7 score.\n\nOther active or high-intensity vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' are excluded due to the emphasis on healing, gentle movement, and restorative care rather than intensity or high energy."
