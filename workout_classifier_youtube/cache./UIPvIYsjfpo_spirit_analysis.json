  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.9 due to its description of 'high-intensity moves to boost your heart rate and torch calories,' as well as the multiple mentions of high intensity and sweat-focused exercises both in the description and tags (e.g., HIIT, SWEAT SESH). The fast-paced nature and the structured intervals (40 seconds on, 20 seconds off) reinforce this. The second spirit, 'Structured & Disciplined,' receives a score of 0.7. This is supported by the methodical division of the workout into distinct sections (Warm-Up, Upper Body, Lower Body, Abs, High Intensity) and the planned progression of targeting different muscle groups within the 30-minute timeframe, indicating a well-organized routine. The confidence is high due to clear and explicit indicators in the title and description."
