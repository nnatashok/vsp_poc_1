  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is focused on a full body stretching routine, emphasizing flexibility, mobility, and relaxation. The lack of verbal guidance suggests users need some familiarity with the stretches, but the focus remains on basic movements that are designed for relief and mindfulness. The emphasis on relaxation and mobility is typically beginner-friendly, but the metadata suggests some intermediate users might find value in it as a transition to yoga self-practice.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is explicitly a stretching routine with no intense physical exercises, hence the effort required is minimal. The duration is fairly short at 16 minutes, and the focus on flexibility and relaxation implies low energy expenditure. Tags such as 'low impact', 'relax', and 'beginnerfriendly' further support this assessment.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the low technique and effort difficulty, beginners are the primary audience for this stretching routine. However, users looking to establish a self-practice in yoga, as hinted in the description, might also find this beneficial. Thus, it could appeal to intermediates seeking mobility improvement or a relaxed session. The multiple levels are justified by the video\u2019s simplicity and the channel\u2019s emphasis on accessibility for all fitness levels."
