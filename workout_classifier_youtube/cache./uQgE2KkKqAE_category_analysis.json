  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Breathing exercises' with a score of 1 due to the explicit focus on 'Box Breathing' and 'Pranayama' mentioned in the title, description, and tags. Specific phrases like 'box breathing technique,' 'guided breathing,' and 'calming breathing exercises' strongly indicate that the video centers on controlled breathing techniques, which aligns directly with the 'Breathing exercises' category.\n\n'Meditation' is assigned as a secondary category with a score of 0.6 because of the meditative elements involved in the breathing practice. Phrases like 'guided breathing meditation' and comments indicating improvements in managing anxiety and achieving a meditative state support this classification. The channel content suggests a focus on mindfulness and mental states, which typically overlaps with meditation practices.\n\nOther categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were considered due to references to 'Pranayama' but were deemed less relevant as there is little evidence of physical postures or flexibility training involved. Therefore, these were excluded from the classification."
