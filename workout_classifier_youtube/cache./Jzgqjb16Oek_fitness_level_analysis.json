  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty involves basic bodyweight exercises like burpees, squat jumps, and mountain climbers which are generally beginner-friendly but can require some coordination and basic fitness understanding. The emphasis on achieving a correct heart rate rather than technical form suggests these exercises are suitable for beginners and intermediates primarily. However, more advanced options are mentioned, keeping in mind different fitness levels, like adjusting the work-to-rest ratio, which could imply a slightly advanced technique for those progressing.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is designed to elevate heart rate significantly to 85% of max, which presents a moderate to challenging effort level for many users. The use of HIIT, as described, indicates a higher energy expenditure than typical low-intensity workouts. Given its short duration (approx. 11 minutes) but high intensity, this workout falls into the moderate to challenging category, especially for those who are deconditioned.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level skews towards Beginner and Intermediate due to the ability to modify work-to-rest ratios and exercise intensity. Although the workout demands a high heart rate, modification options and simple exercises suggest it can still be accessible for Beginners who adjust intensity levels. Intermediate users will find a good challenge due to the structured intensity advice. Some advanced users might find the 2:1 work-to-rest challenging and effective for maintaining cardiovascular and fat loss goals. This aligns with the explanation in the video about adapting work/rest ratios based on fitness levels."
