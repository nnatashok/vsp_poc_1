  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is a 20-minute total body stretch routine, designed for muscle recovery, flexibility, and relaxation, evident from the title and description. The focus on static stretches and yoga postures, mentioned in the description and tags, suggest a calming and restorative experience, aligning with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe, which is characterized by deep stretch and low stress. This strong association is supported by comments highlighting the routine as a calming and in-the-moment session, hence a high score of 0.9.\n\nElements like the inclusion of yoga postures and flowing movements suggest elements of 'The Zen Flow,' with its grounding and intentional nature, resulting in a moderate score of 0.7. The combination of these activities, the focus on relaxation and flexibility, and the context of muscle recovery strongly align with these vibes. Other potential vibes such as 'The Comfort Moves' were considered, but the emphasis on muscle recovery and flexibility is more characteristic of 'The Reboot Workout' than the simpler, cozy feel of 'The Comfort Moves.'"
