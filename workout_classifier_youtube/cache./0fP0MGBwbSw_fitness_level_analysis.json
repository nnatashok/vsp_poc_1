  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises focus on mobility and flexibility, specifically designed for golfers, such as hip and spinal rotation movements. Such mobility routines typically consist of simple to moderately complex exercises aligning with Beginner to Intermediate levels. The movement cues likely focus on proper form given the specificity to golf performance, but the exercises are expected to be accessible with minimal equipment or advanced coordination.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 27-minute routine focusing on mobility, likely involving sustained stretching and gentle movement. Given its goal of increasing flexibility and mobility, the physical exertion is likely low, thus 'Light'. A few moderately demanding stretches could raise physical demand slightly, reaching 'Moderate' for those less conditioned, but overall energy expenditure remains low.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the technique and effort difficulties are predominantly beginner-oriented with some intermediate characteristics, the required fitness level includes both Beginner and Intermediate levels. The routine is straightforward and primarily focused on gaining flexibility, making it suitable for very low to moderately experienced individuals. The length of the workout suggests that it might be slightly challenging for complete beginners, but there are no complex or intense movements to exclude beginners from attempting."
