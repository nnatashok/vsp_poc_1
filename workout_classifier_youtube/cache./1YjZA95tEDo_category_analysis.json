  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected for this video is 'Breathing exercises' with a high score of 1.0. This decision is based on explicit cues from the title and description, such as '4-7-8 Calm Breathing Exercise,' '20 Minutes Maximum Relaxation,' and repeated mentions of the 4-7-8 breathing technique across the metadata. This technique is a well-known breathing exercise aimed at relaxation and anxiety relief. Tags like 'breathing meditation,' 'pranayama exercise,' and 'anxiety relief breathing' further reinforce this classification.\n\nThe secondary category chosen is 'Meditation' with a score of 0.7. The video's channel, 'Hands-On Meditation,' suggests a focus on meditation and mindfulness practices. The description also mentions that the 4-7-8 technique is part of many meditation and yoga practices, and the channel's primary content revolves around guided meditations, which aligns with the meditation classification.\n\nNo other categories were selected as there's no indication of physical activity or equipment use; the emphasis is purely on relaxation through breathing."
