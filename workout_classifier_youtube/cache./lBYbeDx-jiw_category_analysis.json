  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under 'Yoga' due to multiple references in its title and description indicating a yoga flow routine. The title '5 Minute Morning Yoga - Daily Stretching Routine' and the use of terms like 'yoga sequence', 'vinyasa yoga', and 'yoga for flexibility' in the description and tags strongly support this categorization. The recurring mention of yoga and related positions such as 'ragdoll', 'downward facing dog', and 'wide legged forward fold' further bolsters the yoga classification, granting it a high score of 0.9 for its central role.\n\nAdditionally, 'Stretching' is assigned with a moderate score of 0.6 because the video emphasizes flexibility and includes sequences aimed at stretching the body ('daily stretching routine', 'morning stretch', and 'yoga for flexibility'). Although stretching is a key component, it is secondary to the yoga format.\n\nThe comments and tags complement the description by highlighting the video's function as a quick and effective routine, reinforcing its classification under these categories."
