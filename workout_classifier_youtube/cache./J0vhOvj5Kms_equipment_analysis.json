  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout explicitly mentions the use of dumbbells in both the title ('20 minute Full Body Standing Strength Workout with Dumbbells') and the description ('We use dumbbells with these standing exercises'), which indicates a high requirement for them. The description provides alternatives such as water bottles or cans, but these are suggested for those who might not have access to traditional weights. The exercises listed (such as rows, tricep kickbacks, bicep curls, and wood chops) are typically performed with dumbbells, further supporting this classification. Given the clear emphasis on dumbbells in the metadata and the suggested adaptations, the confidence level for the need for dumbbells is very high at 0.8."
