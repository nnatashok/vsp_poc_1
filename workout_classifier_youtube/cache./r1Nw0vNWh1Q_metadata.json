    "To all my spin peeps, if you\u2019re interested, here are some of the concepts that went through my brain as I composed the music for The Journey.  As I experienced The Journey tracks that we did in class, I started to think about what is was about the different types of music made it the best experience.  I felt that if the music could sort of hypnotize me, to keep me involved, without being too distracting, of course leaving room for the instructor monolog, and help the time move along, this was a big plus.  I wanted to create a track that would draw you in, and actually take you on a journey through what is of course, pretty intense exercise. My personal musical influences for this track were probably mostly some of my old favorites for this type of music, Tangerine Dream and Pink Floyd, although the 60 sprints were influenced by more contemporary sounds.  Most of the actual composing for this took place while I was solo camping in Shawnee National Forest in Southern IL. near Carbondale.  I was inspired by a variety of sensory input.  Watching the wind travel through the trees, smelling the forest around me, feeling the warm sun wash over me, and watching the birds and other wildlife go about their own journeys.  At night, it was stars and planets that helped me to visualize and create music that helped me along my own creative journey, and as I wrote this, I thought about our whole spin community, and how much fun it would be to help everyone in the group though a tough 10 min. See you all at the Sat. live rides, can&#39;t wait!",
    "Needed the JOURNEY today to remind me how far I\u2019ve come and that we are never alone! We\u2019ve got this BUTTKICKERS!! Thanks Kaleigh!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc9c<a href=\"UChY_9WJx0saa0St48lSdytQ/ZJ_iYfnrBdOSgAfjlonQAQ\"></a><a href=\"UChY_9WJx0saa0St48lSdytQ/y1m3Z6bMEoy__9EP5IeViAU\"></a><a href=\"UChY_9WJx0saa0St48lSdytQ/y1m3Z87FEoy__9EP5IeViAU\"></a>",
    "I have NEVER pushed harder. Peter\u2019s music was so motivating and perfectly timed. I AM INCREDIBLE!! AND SO IS BLACK DIAMOND SESSIONS.!!",
    "Doing this (again) January 1 2024 and found myself crying when the drumbeat kicked in at the six-minute mark during the sprint. Last year was such a tough year, doing The Journey with Kaleigh took on a whole new meaning. Despite the tears, I felt strong today, stronger than I was this time last year. Life can be a wild ride and I&#39;m grateful to be here for it. Heartfelt thank to the whole KC gang for all the encouragement along the way \u2764",
    "I love to close my eyes during the build in the beginning. I can take a moment to connect with myself and the bike. The journey is more than just a ride. You have to strap in, embrace it, and enjoy the ride. Whatever comes your way, you know you&#39;ll be better on the other side."
