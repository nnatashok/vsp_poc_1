  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves indoor cycling, which is relatively straightforward in terms of technique, requiring primarily pedal motion without complex movement patterns. Terms like 'spin' and 'cycling' are indicative of basic to moderate technique requirements. However, coordination with cycling intervals does elevate the technique slightly to intermediate. User comments from beginners achieving the workout ('newbie cyclist here') suggest accessibility at a beginner level, though it retains some intermediate coordination elements.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The structure of the workout includes intervals of varied intensity, labeled as 'Max!' efforts (10/10 RPE), and short rest periods between. Comments indicate significant sweat and effort, evidenced by a beginner cyclist mentioning feeling drenched. The duration is 15 minutes, which is not extensive, yet provides a hard effort ('seriously tough workout'). These factors point to both moderate and challenging exercise levels due to high-intensity cycles compacted into a brief session. ",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout is approachable for beginners, as indicated by user comments and the non-technical nature of cycling. However, the intense intervals and the need to sustain high effort suggest that beginners with some exercise readiness could handle it, while those without prior experience might struggle. The 15-minute duration and mention of an 8/10 to 10/10 effort in intervals suggest that more conditioned beginners might cope well, aligning closer to intermediate fitness levels due to potential fatigue challenges. Therefore, both beginner and intermediate levels are assigned to accommodate the variation in user capability."
