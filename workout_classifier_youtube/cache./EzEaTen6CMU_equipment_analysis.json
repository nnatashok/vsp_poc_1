  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "Based on the metadata provided, the workout video focuses on a cycling warm-up routine. The title \"Warm Up Cycling Workout\" explicitly mentions cycling, suggesting the need for a bike. The description further supports this by instructing viewers to \"get on your bike and let's get these pedals spinning!\" It also provides modifications for those using different types of stationary bikes, reinforcing the central role of the exercise bike. Therefore, there is a very high confidence (1.0) in identifying an exercise bike as necessary equipment for this workout."
