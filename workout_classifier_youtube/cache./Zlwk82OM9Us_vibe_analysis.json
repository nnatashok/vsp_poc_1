  "vibesExplanation": "The video is clearly intended for end-of-day relaxation and sleep preparation, as evidenced by the title 'Stretching Exercises for Bedtime - Relaxing Routine before Sleep'. The description emphasizes promoting restful sleep and the relaxed nature of the routine ('end a long day', 'feel relaxed and rejuvenated'). The comments support the idea of stress relief and relaxation, with expressions of how the video helps users feel relaxed and ready for bedtime. The tags include 'better sleep', 'relaxing stretches', and 'stretches to do before bed', all reinforcing the evening, sleep-preparation context. The vibe 'The Sleep Prep' is an extremely strong match, given the focus on winding down before bed (score 1.0). The 'The Comfort Moves' vibe fits with the low-impact, easy approach for seniors and beginners, as noted in the channel description and tags like 'senior fitness' (score 0.7). 'The Deep Recharge' vibe is also appropriate due to the emphasis on relaxation and minimal physical exertion, aligning with descriptors like 'relaxing stretches' (score 0.6). Overall, the confidence is very high (0.9) due to explicit metadata indicators directing toward sleep preparation and relaxation."
