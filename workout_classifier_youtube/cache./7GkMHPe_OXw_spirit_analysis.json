  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is a '20 Min FULL BODY Workout For BEGINNERS (No Equipment)', aligned with the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit due to its methodical approach, clear guidance, and use of 30-second intervals for each exercise, as noted in the description. This precise structure in timing and exercise progression indicates a disciplined format, earning it a high score of 0.7. The emphasis on beginners' suitability and advanced options suggests a structured yet adaptive approach.\n\nAdditionally, there is a minor element of 'Flow & Rhythm' as the workout is designed for beginners with follow-along cues, promoting a degree of rhythmic movement, though this is not the core focus, hence a moderate score of 0.3. The channel's focus on providing physical therapy guidance further supports the structured approach. \n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded as the video is beginner-focused without high intensity or relaxation elements. 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Sport & Agility' are irrelevant due to the home setting and lack of sports-specific movements."
