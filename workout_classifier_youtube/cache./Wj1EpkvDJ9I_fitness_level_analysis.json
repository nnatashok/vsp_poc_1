  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is primarily targeted at beginners and intermediates and involves calisthenics exercises, which often include simple bodyweight movements. While parallettes can add complexity, the video's focus on being suitable for beginners suggests modifications or simpler movements are presented. The use of optional equipment (parallettes) indicates some coordination and technique are necessary, especially for intermediate users. Tags and comments reinforce that it's accessible to newer users, resulting in Beginner and Intermediate scores.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 25-minute length implies a moderate effort level, especially since it is designed to be a follow-along workout. There's mention of sweating and users finding it effective, suggesting a reasonably demanding effort, particularly if using parallettes which can increase intensity. The description also emphasizes it being strength-building, indicating a workout that requires moderate to challenging effort for less fit users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulty, the workout is suitable for Beginners and Intermediates, as stated in the description. There's an emphasis on inclusivity and adaptability to both fitness levels. The optional parallettes can offer enhancements for Intermediate users while remaining accessible to beginners through modifications. Advanced users may find the technique simple but can still leverage the workout's potential intensity, hence a lower Advanced score."
