  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled '20 Minute Fat Burning Workout | High Intensity Interval Training' clearly suggests a High-Energy & Intense spirit. The inclusion of terms like 'Fat Burning', 'High Intensity Interval Training', and 'burn fat and get fit fast' in both the title and description reinforce the intense energy and vigorous nature of this session. The instructions to have 'plenty of water and a towel for your hard earned sweat!' further emphasize the high-energy demand. User comments highlight the workout's difficulty, with phrases such as 'makes the 30 second recoveries seem like 3 seconds' indicating the intense effort required, thus a score of 0.9 for this spirit is appropriate.\n\nThe Structured & Disciplined spirit is evident through the methodical nature of HIIT workouts that involve specific intervals and a focus on progression. The additional resources suggested in the description, like The Sufferfest app for tracking targets, and frequent user mentions of routine, such as '3 times a week', suggest a systematic approach. Hence, this spirit scores a 0.75. Other spirits, like Flow & Rhythm or Soothing & Restorative, are not applicable due to the workout's intensity and structure-focused nature."
