  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is designed as a low-impact, bodyweight exercise routine suitable for individuals with knee or lower body problems. The title specifically mentions 'No Jumping,' indicating that the exercises are low impact. Moreover, both the description and channel information emphasize that no equipment is required, focusing on bodyweight exercises that can be easily done at home. Tags like 'home workout no jumping,' 'workout for knee problem,' and 'simple weight loss workout' further support the idea that this is a bodyweight workout without the need for any additional equipment. The metadata does not mention any equipment and consistently suggests that the exercises are accessible and equipment-free. The lack of any user comments mentioning equipment also aligns with the conclusion that this is a bodyweight-only workout."
