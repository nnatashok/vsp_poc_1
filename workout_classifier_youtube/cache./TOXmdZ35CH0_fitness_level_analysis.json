  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout video is designed specifically for beginners as indicated by the title and tags that repeatedly emphasize 'beginner' and 'no equipment'. Calisthenics for beginners generally involves simple bodyweight exercises that do not require complex movements or high levels of coordination. The channel itself is focused on calisthenics, which implies a range of exercises, but the video's specific labeling as 'beginner' suggests straightforward exercises like squats or push-ups.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video is 22 minutes long, which suggests a continuous low-to-medium energy expenditure, suitable for improving cardiovascular endurance at a beginner level. The description and comments highlight it as challenging but achievable, suggesting moderate effort. User feedback indicating a 'little warm' and being 'drenched in sweat' supports a moderate classification for users in poor physical shape.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique difficulty is beginner and the effort level is moderate, the workout is highly accessible for beginners. However, the duration slightly over 20 minutes might be a bit challenging for some beginners, justifying an intermediate level inclusion for those new to consistent exercise. Comments suggesting the workout was satisfying but involved some effort ('drenched in sweat') support the inclusion of the intermediate level."
