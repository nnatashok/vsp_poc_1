    "I\u2019m a 59 y/o woman who was quite depressed about how stiff my body was, just doing everyday tasks. Today is my third day of doing Tom\u2019s stretches and from the very first day, I felt SO much more fluid &amp; energetic (and better about myself too). I\u2019m so glad I found Tom\u2019s videos as I\u2019m benefiting both physically &amp; mentally. I might not be able to complete all the stretches quite as deeply as Tom yet, but watch out world - I\u2019m getting there!!!! \ud83e\udd29",
    "65 years old , riding 30 miles per day on a bicycle and never have stretched (dumb!) I started doing this 15 minute routine and within 4 days, my chronic back pain disappeared.  Tom&#39;s videos are slow paced, great for people my age!",
    "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_xrDAtykMI&amp;t=140\">2:20</a> &quot;and don&#39;t forget to breathe &quot;<br>At first I thought \u00bfWho would forget to breathe? And then I realized that I wasn&#39;t breathing at all",
    "5 years later and I STILL come to this video specifically to follow the routine. I highly recommend for anyone looking to get a good stretch in and relieve some tension. It\u2019s great on the back, legs and arms! I love to do it as soon as I wake up (great way to start the day) or before bed. Thank you Tom!",
    "Finally a decent stretch routine that doesn&#39;t assume you&#39;re a thin, flexible, yoga experienced person."
