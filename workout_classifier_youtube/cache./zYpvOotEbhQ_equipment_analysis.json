  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video metadata indicates that this is a guided meditation session, emphasized by phrases in the title, description, and tags such as 'Guided Meditation,' 'Powerful meditation,' and 'feel your presence.' There is no mention of any physical activities or exercises that would require physical equipment. The content is likely focused on mental exercises, which typically do not require any specialized equipment. As such, this video is classified as requiring no physical workout equipment, and it appears to be a bodyweight-only session, which in the case of meditation, means simply requiring a comfortable space to sit or lie down."
