  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video clearly indicates that it is an indoor cycling workout, specifically mentioned in both the title \"30 Minute HIIT Cardio Indoor Cycling Workout | Lose Weight Fast\" and the description with phrases like \"indoor HIIT cycling session.\" The tags include terms such as \"indoor cycling,\" \"gym bike,\" and \"spin class,\" which further confirm the need for an exercise bike. Additionally, a top comment explicitly mentions using a \"normal exercise bike.\" Therefore, the required equipment for this workout is an exercise bike, with very high confidence."
