  "vibesExplanation": "The video '15-Minute Yoga Nidra for Peace and Relaxation | \u092f\u094b\u0917 \u0928\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e \u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928 | Guided Meditation' from Satvic Movement is most accurately classified as 'The Deep Recharge' with a score of 0.95. This classification is supported by the title, description, and comments which emphasize relaxation, peace, and a calm state of mind, all characteristic of Yoga Nidra. The session is described as one that provides mental peace and bodily rest, aligning closely with the 'Deep Recharge' vibe, which involves a nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement. The frequent mention of terms such as 'peace,' 'relaxation,' and 'calmness' in both the description and user comments further enforce this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Sleep Prep' is relevant with a score of 0.7, as the practice prepares individuals for rest and stress relief, akin to preparing for sleep. One comment notes the energizing effect comparable to a good night's sleep, highlighting its potential role in reducing symptoms of anxiety and aiding in sleep preparation. These elements, along with the Yoga Nidra practice's inherent nature of preparing the mind and body for deep rest, justify this secondary vibe assignment. The very high confidence level is due to the strong alignment of metadata with these vibes."
