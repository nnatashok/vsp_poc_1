  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video titled '45 Minute HIIT Tabata Workout with Weights' from the HASfit channel is classified with a primary spirit of 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.95. This high score is due to several explicit indicators: the terms 'HIIT', 'Tabata', and 'with Weights' suggest a session focused on high-intensity training designed to elevate heart rate and maximize effort. The user comments also support this, with descriptions of the workout as 'brutal' and 'sweat was pouring.' The high view and like count further affirm its intense and engaging nature.\n\nThe secondary spirit is 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.7, due to the well-organized approach indicated by the type of workout (Tabata is known for its structured timing intervals), as well as the workout being part of a consistent program promoted by the channel. The mention of a workout preview also suggests a disciplined structure.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded due to the focus on intensity and weight training, rather than smooth movement or relaxation."
