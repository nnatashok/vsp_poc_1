  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video focuses on a gentle stretching routine intended to relax and improve flexibility. This type of workout generally involves simple, straightforward movements that require minimal coordination, classifying the technique difficulty as 'Beginner'. The inclusion of terms like 'gentle routine' and 'relaxation' supports this classification. Additionally, 'Intermediate' is included at a lower score because some flexibility poses might require a little more technique, aligning with some yoga practice skills, yet the presence of no complex cues or high difficulty poses sustains the predominantly beginner focus.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is characterized as a 'gentle' stretching routine designed for relaxation and stress relief, which typically involves minimal physical intensity. The focus is on relaxation and flexibility in a non-intense manner as indicated by the tags and description. The absence of dynamic strength exercises and high cardio intensity supports a 'Light' effort difficulty. User comments also suggest the routine is used for calming and decompressing, underscoring the absence of significant energy expenditure.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner', as the technique and effort difficulty assessments highlight simplicity and low energy requirement, suitable for individuals new to exercise or seeking relaxation. However, some flexibility poses can be slightly challenging, justifying a marginal 'Intermediate' score. The minimal physical and technical demands indicated by the terms 'gentle', 'relaxing', and user feedback point strongly toward broad accessibility, predominantly at the beginner level, with some room for slightly more experienced users to find value."
