  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout includes a range of calisthenics exercises such as pull-ups, dips, and push-ups, which require moderate body coordination and technique mastery. Things like negative pull-ups and L-sits suggest a need for more strength and control, which aligns with intermediate difficulty. Exercises like muscle-ups, although not explicitly listed, are common in calisthenics and would push the technique difficulty toward advanced.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The video duration is just over 14 minutes, pointing to a moderate level of effort. Given the exercises mentioned (pull-ups, L-sits, dips), the energy expenditure is likely moderate to challenging, with short rest periods inferred from a fast-paced workout style typical of calisthenics routines. Comments about sticking through imply significant, though not extreme, effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The workout involves a mix of exercises that require some basic form and strength (e.g., pull-ups, dips), nudging it beyond complete beginner level, but still accessible with modifications (such as knee push-ups or assisted pull-ups). Multiple levels were included given potential modifications users can make and the varying complexity within calisthenics. Metadata highlighting exercise progressions (e.g., negative pull-ups) further support inclusion of intermediate and advanced levels."
