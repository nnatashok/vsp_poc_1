  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title, description, and tags of the video focus entirely on breathwork and breathing exercises, specifically mentioning techniques like the Wim Hof method and DMT breathing. There is no indication of any physical workout equipment being required or used in this session. The description furthers this by highlighting the safety advice for breathwork, with no mention of equipment. Comments and channel information reinforce the focus on breathwork without any reference to equipment use. Therefore, this workout appears to be bodyweight only, requiring no physical equipment."
