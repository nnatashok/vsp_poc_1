  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout involves high-intensity interval training with weights, which typically requires intermediate-level technique. Using weights introduces a level of complexity that requires proper form to avoid injury, increasing the difficulty. However, since this is an at-home routine, it's not likely to involve highly technical movements characteristic of advanced technique levels. The video likely includes a mix of straightforward movements performed at high intensity, which are manageable for intermediate users.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 38 minutes long and described as high-intensity interval training, indicating a high level of energy expenditure. Comments reference significant effort and fatigue ('dropped my weights', 'almost quit'), implying a demanding routine. Given the duration, intensity, and incorporation of weights, this workout fits well into the 'Challenging' category. The 'Extreme' score reflects the intense effort likely required, especially for less fit individuals.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.75,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the combination of intermediate to advanced technique difficulty and the challenging to extreme effort level, the workout is best suited for individuals at an intermediate fitness level, but it also presents significant demands appropriate for advanced users, especially due to its length and intensity. The metadata doesn't strongly support a beginner classification due to the complexity and high effort scores, which would be demanding for someone new to fitness."
