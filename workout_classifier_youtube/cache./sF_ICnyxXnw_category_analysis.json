  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is strongly classified under 'Calisthenics' with a score of 0.9 and 'Body weight' with a score of 0.7. This classification is based on several pieces of metadata. The title includes the term 'Calisthenics', indicating that the workout is centered around calisthenics exercises. Additionally, multiple tags such as 'intermediate calisthenics', 'no equipment calisthenics', and 'full body calisthenics' emphasize a focus on calisthenics as a workout form, making calisthenics the core element. The description reinforces this, listing 'best intermediate Calisthenics exercises' and describing it as a 'full body' workout, which is characteristic of calisthenics due to its use of body weight for resistance. Furthermore, user comments refer to the calisthenics exercises and their effectiveness, particularly in building strength and mobility. The category 'Body weight' is selected due to the 'no equipment' aspect, which aligns with using the body as resistance in strength exercises. Given the consistent focus on calisthenics throughout the title, description, tags, and user comments, this classification holds very high confidence."
