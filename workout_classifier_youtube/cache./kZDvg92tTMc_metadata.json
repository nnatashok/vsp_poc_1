Simply follow along and have fun!\n\nThis is meant for low intensity cardio so any jumps, land softly.

    "She almost killed me with this cardio workout!! I had to modify but I didn\u2019t quit!! I\u2019m trying to get back into focusing on my health. Today makes 7 months since I lost my daughter and working out again makes me feel it\u2019s okay to keep on living in my pain. God bless everyone. Keep pushing forward no matter what life throws your way.",
    "Tried this for the first time. I was looking to add more cardio into my workout routine. Baybeee this is not for the faint of heart. I took hella breaks. Anyone who finishes this all the way through is a beast. Thank u Caroline!",
    "My mind : its ok , u can do this don&#39;t stop <br>My heart : if u don&#39;t stop , i will",
    "Messaging from heaven....11/10 workout, don&#39;t forget to take breaks guys....",
    "Today I&#39;m 17 and I&#39;ve just done this workout. I love how this helps my digestion, helps me calm down, relieve my stress, anxiety and panic as I live in Ukraine. It&#39;s amazing how I&#39;m able to move easier now when we learn our last dance for graduation. Totally worth to do it. Thank you for this video, have a good day\ud83d\ude0a"
