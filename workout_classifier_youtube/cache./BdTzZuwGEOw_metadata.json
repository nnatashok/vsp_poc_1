    "Every time I do yoga for the first time in a long time, tears start welling up in my eyes. It makes me speculate about how little time I give to myself and that makes me sad. Thanks for sharing.",
    "When people say mean things to or about you, it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s almost always about them and their insecurities. Sometimes we want to take things a little personally, because it means that we\u2019re important. But truth be told, people are mostly thinking about themselves. And they don\u2019t care about us as much as we\u2019d like to think they do. For me, this was the best realization. People don\u2019t remember what you wore or said nearly as much as you think about it. Let\u2019s stop obsessing and taking ourselves so seriously.",
    "thank you so much, i am 16(male) and have been having sleeping problems and this has helped me get to sleep faster",
    "this was the video I chose for my very first practice. I felt so amazing afterwards I&#39;ve done yoga every morning since. This video is perfect for those who have never stepped on a mat. Thank you Candace! &lt;3",
    "My wife and I have been doing yoga for about 2 weeks now. Just following whatever 20 minute video we can after the kids go to bed. This is the first video we both actually like!<br>We&#39;ll definitely be back for more of this one :)"
