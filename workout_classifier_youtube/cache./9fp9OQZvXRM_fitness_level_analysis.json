  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video features a 40-minute vinyasa yoga flow with elements like hip openers, backbends, side planks, and standing balances. While described as suitable for all levels, these poses typically require a mix of foundational and moderate skills. Phrases like 'steady vinyasa flow' suggest coordination and balance are needed. Based on the inclusion of modifications and the calming nature emphasized in comments, the technique difficulty aligns most with Intermediate, though simpler poses justify a Beginner level. Advanced level relevance is due to standing balances and backbends, which require more skill.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session's 40+ minute duration indicates a significant time commitment, typically leading to higher energy expenditure. While it's positioned as 'true yoga' focusing on breathing and controlled movements, the continuous vinyasa flow involves sustained effort without explicit rest periods. User comments mention feeling challenged yet relaxed, suggesting a Moderate and Challenging effort level for less fit users. The session's mindfulness focus prevents it from reaching an Extreme level, despite its length.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level draws on the Intermediate technique difficulty and Moderate effort difficulty, justifying a strong Intermediate classification. The inclusion of modifications and user feedback indicating that beginners find it achievable fit a Beginner level, albeit less strongly due to the duration and some complex poses. Advanced users find value by refining skills on standing balances and backbends, as warm-up instructions are likely given by an experienced instructor. Thus, combining the techniques and effort, Intermediate and Advanced most logically fit, with some inclusivity for Beginners."
