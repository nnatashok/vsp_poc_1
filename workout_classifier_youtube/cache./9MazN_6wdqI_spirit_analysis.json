  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Yoga To Reduce Stress | 30 Min Slow Flow - Relaxing Stretches + Savasana' predominantly embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. This is evident from the focus on relaxation and stress reduction, as emphasized in both the title ('Reduce Stress', 'Relaxing Stretches') and the description, which highlights gentle, mindful movement meant to aid in recovery and relaxation. The mention of 'Savasana', a restorative pose, further corroborates this classification. This spirit is assigned a high score of 0.9 due to the strong emphasis on relaxation and recovery, as supported by user comments describing the calming effect of the practice.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is a secondary component, given the description of a 'gentle flow' that involves moving with the breath, suggesting a rhythmic and smooth sequence. The use of specific poses like 'child's pose to cobra' and 'downward dog' supports this classification, warranting a moderate score of 0.6. Other potential spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense', are excluded due to the video's slow pace and relaxation focus, as indicated by user comments and overall presentation."
