    "Happy Monday team!! I hope you all have a great start with this killer workout - we love Military Monday&#39;s don&#39;t we?! \ud83d\udd25Work hard, enjoy the sweat and hope you feel aaaamazing after :) Big love, Anna xx",
    "What a KILLER workout. I really enjoy how you push limits. These workouts are the best I have found so far, and I immensely enjoy them. No talking, just sweating. Please keep this up, it\u2019s highly motivating. Cheers!",
    "I&#39;ve done almost all of your 30 and 45 minute HIIT workouts.  This one is by far the hardest to complete with fidelity.  The first 22 minutes, culminating with the lunge jumps, provide a tremendous thigh burn.",
    "Hi anna. Ive been doing your workouts for years now. since middle school &lt;3 I used to struggle with binge eating and depression really bad back when i was younger. Then i recovered and started doing your workouts &lt;3 you helped me get in the best shape i ever was. I was always a chubby kid, but then i was starting to feel stronger, healthier and more confident :). lately though with testing and other personal issues, ive been feeling hopeless. Stressed. I started binge eating again to cope with the stress. I stopped working out. Life lost passion. The only spark of hope was my boyfriend. But we drifted apart, and I lost him too. Ive been binge eating bad these past few days. Just eating and eating no matter how full i was. This morning i woke up and looked in the mirror and saw the same, sad, depressed, insecure girl that I was all of those years ago. And it broke my heart to see myself so broken. So let go. I sat in bed thinking. Now im determined to get back on track and regain my strength and my self esteem. We must continue on and pick ourselves up no matter how hard we are hit. No matter what life throws at us we must persevere and carry on. And with your videos, I am able to do that. The workouts, the clarity, the accomplished feeling. Thank you so much. &lt;3",
    "&quot;This was so easy&quot; - said no one after Anna&#39;s workouts! Thank you for your amazing work!"
