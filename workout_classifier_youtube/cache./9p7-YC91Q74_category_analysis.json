  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Body weight' due to the explicit mention in the title 'NO EQUIPMENT BODYWEIGHT WORKOUT!' and in the description that emphasizes bodyweight exercises for abs. The focus on various core muscles and the objective of achieving a six-pack also supports this categorization, indicating exercises targeting the abdominal area without any weights. This category is assigned a high score of 0.9 due to its centrality in the workout.\n\n'Mat' is chosen as the secondary category since the workout involves exercises typically performed on the floor, such as 'Scissors Leg Raise' and 'Leg Raise to Hip Up,' as mentioned in the comments. These are typically done on a mat, which supports its inclusion. The score of 0.7 reflects its relevance as a necessary aspect of the workout but secondary to the primary focus of bodyweight resistance training.\n\nNo evidence supports categories like 'Weighted workout,' 'Yoga,' or 'Calisthenics,' as the video does not include equipment or the variety typical of calisthenics."
