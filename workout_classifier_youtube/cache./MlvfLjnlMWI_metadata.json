  "title": "Central Park Virtual Run: Great Treadmill Scenery for Running or Walking in the New York City Park",
  "description": "This is a virtual run around the lower loop of New York City's Central Park on a brisk and sunny morning in early spring. Central Park NYC is one of the most popular running and walking destinations in the world, so this is great treadmill scenery for your workout.  Take in the amazing Manhattan skyline, while passing world renowned places like the Metropolitan Museum and Tavern on the Green. Now you're a new yorker!\n\n#virtualrun #treadmillscenery #newyorkcityvirtualrun",
  "channelTitle": "Treadily",
  "channelDescription": "Walk, run or even bike to a variety of virtual running videos for treadmill users. Treadmill scenery includes beaches, parks and streets in and around amazing places like New York City, Miami, New Orleans and Washington DC.  It's almost like being there.  Well that's not really true, but it's definitely cheaper than actually going and if you tell your friends that you've crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, it's technically not a lie if you've watched the video of me doing it.  Indoor walking and running scenery is the perfect motivation for your at home workouts!",
