  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled '20 MIN EXPRESS PILATES WORKOUT' and heavily utilizes the tags and descriptions that suggest a Pilates session, such as \"mat pilates\", \"express pilates\", and \"at-home pilates\". Pilates typically requires a mat for various floor-based exercises to ensure comfort and proper support on the floor, which corresponds with the term \"mat pilates\". Although no other specific equipment is explicitly mentioned in the provided metadata, the strong emphasis on Pilates and common practices within such workouts support a very high confidence that a mat is needed. Therefore, a mat is identified as essential with a confidence score of 0.95."
