  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '15 Min Full Body Stretch for Flexibility & Mobility' suggests a workout primarily focused on stretching to enhance flexibility and mobility. The description emphasizes the routine as a post-workout stretch, beneficial for increasing flexibility and reducing muscle soreness and stress. There is no mention of specific equipment like dumbbells or resistance bands, and the workout is described as relaxing.\n\nThe type of exercise performed\u2014stretching\u2014implicitly requires a comfortable surface to perform floor exercises, which is where a mat would typically be used. This is especially relevant given common practice in fitness for such routines and the lack of an indication of other equipment in the metadata.\n\nThe confidence score for a mat is set at 0.8, reflecting high confidence based on common use in such routines and the description's emphasis on relaxation and stretching, which often implies a soft surface to perform exercises safely and comfortably. There is no indication in the metadata to suggest the use of any other specific equipment for this routine. Therefore, a mat appears to be the only necessary equipment for this workout."
