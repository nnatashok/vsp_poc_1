  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe assigned to this workout is \"The Foundation Builder\" (score: 0.9). The video is specifically designed to introduce beginners to calisthenics, emphasizing learning fundamentals, correcting common beginner mistakes, and working on core strength and balance. The repetitive emphasis on starting calisthenics properly aligns with building a strong foundation. The presence of terms such as 'beginner', 'tips', 'calisthenics exercises', and the discussion about correcting 'beginner mistakes' reinforces this.\n\n\"The Masterclass Workout\" is also a suitable vibe (score: 0.7) due to the tutorial nature of the content. The video aims to teach and educate viewers about the specifics of calisthenics exercises, suggesting a focus on technique and skill development. The mention of exercises like Diamond Push Up and Chin Up further underscores this educational focus.\n\nFinally, \"The Progression Quest\" (score: 0.6) is indicated by the video\u2019s goal to help users 'progress very fast' in calisthenics, which implies structured and methodical improvement. The channel\u2019s focus on motivating and coaching for skill acquisition supports this minor vibe. Other vibes like \"The Zen Flow\" or \"The Warrior Workout\" are excluded due to the lack of emphasis on relaxation or extreme intensity."
