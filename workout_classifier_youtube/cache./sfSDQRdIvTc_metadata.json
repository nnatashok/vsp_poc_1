  "description": "Practice Asanas, Pranayama and meditations \nLast few days to register for our 21-Day Yoga Program - https://yoga.satvicmovement.org/?utm_source=sy_yt&utm_medium=video_desc&utm_campaign=meditationoverthinking\n\nI used to believe that overthinking and stress were going to be my lifelong friends, ones that wouldn't leave me even though I didn't want them. \ud83d\ude13\n\nHowever, after being introduced to yogic practices and philosophy, I bid these two \"friends\" goodbye in just a matter of months. \ud83d\udc4b\n\nThis meditation is designed to shift your awareness away from the chaos of life and toward a state of calm, peace, and centeredness. \ud83d\ude0c\n\nPractice this every day, early in the morning and right before going to sleep, for the best experience. Do it on a light stomach, with earphones on, and in a quiet environment. \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nShare your experiences with this meditation in the comments below! \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc",
