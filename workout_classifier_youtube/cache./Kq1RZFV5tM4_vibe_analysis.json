  "vibesExplanation": "The video is best classified under 'The Reboot Workout' and 'The Zen Flow'. The description emphasizes reduction of muscle soreness, increasing flexibility, and stress reduction, typical of a 'Reboot Workout', which aims for a total-body refresh through low-stress movements. Tags like 'full body stretch', 'flexibility', 'relaxing stretch', and 'mobility' reinforce this categorization. High views and likes indicate audience resonance with these qualities. \n\nThe 'Zen Flow' vibe fits because the video is intended to be relaxing, calming, and unhurried, which is consistent with a practice centered around intentional movement and breath - elements often mentioned in comments and description. \n\nThe content is not intense or fast-paced, so vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Firestarter' do not apply. The high confidence score arises from explicit mention of relaxation, flexibility, and mobility, crucial aspects of 'Reboot' and 'Zen Flow'. However, there's some ambiguity due to the potential variability in individual experiences."
