  "vibesExplanation": "The workout emphasizes dynamic stretching and flexibility, which aligns closely with \"The Reboot Workout\" vibe, aimed at providing a deep stretch and low-stress total-body refresh. The phrase \"Full Body RECOVERY\" in the title and \"recovery days\" in the description strongly support this classification, justifying a high score of 0.9. The video emphasizes mobility and intentional movement without high intensity, which fits \"The Zen Flow\" vibe, albeit to a lesser degree, due to the video's focus on increasing mobility and flexibility while maintaining a calm, breath-centered flow; thus, it scores a 0.7. Additionally, \"The Foundation Builder\" is considered due to the focus on core strengthening and muscle definition, evident in the tags and workout details, which implies an element of rebuilding and perfecting basics. This factor contributes to a moderate score of 0.5. The presence of core exercises and the structured format without high strain precludes an alignment with high-intensity or competitive vibes."
