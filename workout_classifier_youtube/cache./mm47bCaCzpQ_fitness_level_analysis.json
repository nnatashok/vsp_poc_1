  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises mentioned in the comments (push-ups, pike push-ups, plank ups) are primarily bodyweight exercises that are common and relatively simple in terms of technique. Standard push-ups fall under beginner level, while variations like pike push-ups may require more control and strength, thus shifting the overall difficulty slightly towards intermediate. The metadata suggests the workout is accessible for beginners but also challenging enough for those with some experience, with the inclusion of various push-up styles requiring some coordination and balance.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 20-minute workout without equipment implies a moderate level of physical demand, suitable for bodyweight exercises focused on the upper body. The high view count and positive comments indicate significant exertion, but descriptions indicate it's feasible for those starting out. The tag 'sweat' and comments on break times suggest a fairly continuous workout with notable energy expenditure, pushing the effort toward moderately challenging for deconditioned users.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort required, the workout is most suitable for beginners and intermediates, with possibilities for progression. The presence of variations suggests it's adaptable to different fitness levels, while the 20-minute duration pushes it slightly beyond a pure beginner routine. The mention of participants trying it multiple times per week indicates it's accessible yet challenging enough for those with minimal experience, warranting inclusion of intermediate and even a slight score for advanced due to the potential to increase intensity by reducing rest or maximizing rep numbers."
