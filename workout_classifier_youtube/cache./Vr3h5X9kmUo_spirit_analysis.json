  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is classified predominantly as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to the emphasis on continuous and smooth movement as suggested by the title '15 MIN MORNING YOGA FLOW' and tags like 'vinyasa yoga' and 'yoga flow'. This indicates a pace and structure consistent with rhythmic, music-driven, and mind-body connecting experiences typical of yoga flows. The high view count and likes suggest it effectively delivers these qualities. The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant, scoring moderately high, due to descriptors like 'feeling balanced, energized' in the description and user comments highlighting mood improvement and daily preparation. The comments also note feelings of therapy and relaxation, with users experiencing mental benefits such as mood elevation and day-to-day wellness \u2014 indicators of a restorative quality. The absence of high-intensity language, sport-specific elements, or environmental context such as outdoor settings led to the exclusion of other spirits. Confidence in the analysis is high due to the clear thematic alignment to both identified spirits."
