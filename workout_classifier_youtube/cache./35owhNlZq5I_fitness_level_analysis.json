  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty predominantly involves using an elliptical machine, which requires minimal technical skill. The novice can quickly adapt due to the guided nature of the workout and the limited coordination or balance requirement. The workout is classified as 'intermediate' in advertising, suggesting a moderate skill level for some varied intervals and resistance changes. However, due to the nature of elliptical training, it leans more towards beginner-level technique with slight variations earning it an intermediate consideration.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.8,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Effort difficulty is primarily 'Challenging,' as indicated by the workout's HIIT format and intermittent high resistance sprint intervals, causing significant energy expenditure over the 33-minute session. The workout's structure with short rest periods and varying resistance adds to its challenging nature, further compounded by user feedback describing the workout as demanding. However, options such as choosing resistance levels suggest it can be toned down to a 'Moderate' difficulty for those who need it, covering a range from moderate to challenging effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Intermediate,' aligning with the advertised workout level and the feedback indicating significant effort required. Despite its guided nature and straightforward machine use, the workout involves sustained effort over 33 minutes, high-intensity intervals, and variable resistance\u2014attributes more suited to those with some fitness foundation. However, owing to the aggressive nature described by users and a prolonged duration which exposes users to sustained high intensity, it also aligns strongly with an 'Advanced' level requirement, particularly if users push resistance and pace."
