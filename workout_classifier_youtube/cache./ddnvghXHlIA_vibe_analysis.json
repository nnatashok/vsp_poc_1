  "vibesExplanation": "The video title and description emphasize a 'No Jumping Workout', which aligns well with the 'The Comfort Moves' vibe due to its focus on gentle, feel-good movement suitable for individuals with knee issues or living in space-constrained environments like apartments. Additionally, the description highlights the workout as 'low impact' and 'simple', which are strong indicators of a comfortable vibe suitable for a range of fitness levels.\n\nUser comments also support this classification, noting benefits such as being ideal for those in apartments and its suitability for heavier individuals, further suggesting a supportive and non-intimidating workout environment.\n\nThe 'Reboot Workout' vibe is also appropriate due to the low-impact nature and the intent of the workout to serve as a daily, restorative exercise program, offering a mild but effective routine that can be integrated into daily life to help improve fitness without high intensity. The 'before bed' remark in the comments suggests it functions as a wind-down routine for some users, strengthening the 'Reboot Workout' classification.\n\nThese vibes effectively capture the workout's emphasis on gentleness and accessibility while maintaining a focus on weight loss and fitness improvements."
