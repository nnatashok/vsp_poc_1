  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily categorized as 'Stretching' as it features 25 minutes of dynamic stretching exercises aimed at improving flexibility and mobility, as evident from the title ('25 MIN STRETCH & CORE - Full Body RECOVERY') and description ('dynamic stretching and strengthening exercises to increase your overall flexibility'). A score of 0.8 is assigned to this category due to the strong and direct emphasis on flexibility workouts in the metadata.\n\nThe 'Mat' category is also relevant with a score of 0.6, as the workout involves exercises typically done on the floor (as suggested by 'Full Body RECOVERY (Mobility, Flexibility Workout at home), no equipment'), which fits the description for general mat exercises.\n\n'Body weight' is given a score of 0.4 due to mention of 'core strength' and 'strengthening exercises' in the description, indicating some element of resistance work using body weight. The scoring reflects the moderate presence of this element, given the focus is more on stretching and flexibility than pure strength training.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 0.9, acknowledging the clear indicators in the metadata for the categories selected, despite the broader range of tags that span various workout types, which may add some minimal ambiguity."
