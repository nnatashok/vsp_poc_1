  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this video is 'Soothing & Restorative,' which is supported by the focus on gentle stretching and flexibility improvement, aimed at reducing tension and increasing mobility. The description emphasizes that this routine is perfect for beginners and aims to decrease tension, making it accessible and relaxing, which aligns with restorative qualities. The title and description reinforce the idea of improving flexibility rather than pushing physical limits. This spirit receives a score of 0.8 due to the clear emphasis throughout.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Structured & Disciplined,' receiving a score of 0.5. This is inferred from the sequential outline of the stretches and Dr. Jared Beckstrand's methodical approach. The routine follows a specific sequence, and there are references to physical therapy and discipline in continuing the practice, as seen in user comments. However, the evidence is less direct compared to the soothing aspect, so the score is moderate. The 'Flow & Rhythm' and other spirits were excluded as the pacing and content focus heavily on static stretching rather than dynamic flow or high-energy movement."
