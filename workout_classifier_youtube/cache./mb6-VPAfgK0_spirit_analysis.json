  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout video is clearly 'Soothing & Restorative', with very high confidence (score: 0.9). The title and description emphasize relaxation, anxiety relief, and calming of the sympathetic nervous system, which are core aspects of restorative exercises. Terms such as 'Calm Breathing', 'Relaxation', 'Anxiety Relief', and 'promotes relaxation' explicitly indicate a focus on soothing and restorative energy.\n\nThe secondary spirit identified is 'Flow & Rhythm' (score: 0.7). The video focuses on the 4-7-8 breathing technique, which involves rhythmic, patterned breathing. This technique aligns with the Flow & Rhythm spirit as it invites the viewer to engage in a continuous breathing pattern that promotes a mind-body connection. This is further supported by the description noting the gradual slowing and extension of breaths to an ideal calming pace, which incorporates rhythm.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' were excluded due to the absence of intensity or athletic elements in the video metadata, which consistently centers on relaxation and calm."
