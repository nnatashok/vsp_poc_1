    "I just finished this workout. I&#39;m 60 years old. If I can do it anyone can. I&#39;ve been working out for many years.",
    "Claudia is so positive and encouraging. Hasfit won&#39;t be the same without her. What a great team Coach Kozak and Claudia make. Thank you guys \ud83d\ude0a",
    "This is my favorite go-to workout! I started WW in February of 2018 and have been using HASFIT workouts consistently throughout my weight loss journey. I\u2019ve lost 68 lbs and in the best shape of my life. Thank you for the awesome workouts and motivation!",
    "I absolutely love these workouts. I\u2019ll be 54 next month and I\u2019m beginning to negatively feel my super high intensity workouts. They just don\u2019t cut it anymore. Instead of finishing and feeling strong, I\u2019m suffering from foot and joint issues.  But what I find with these workouts is that they are still very challenging and my body is in better shape than with just jogging or running myself crazy on an elliptical for an hour. Definitely see a significant change in my body composition. I\u2019ve been telling everyone about Hasfit. I also love the encouraging words spoken throughout the workouts. I\u2019m a fan for life!",
    "Thank you for getting each day started right in both mental and physical shape! Your workouts are so easy to follow but challenging and motivating. Thank you!"
