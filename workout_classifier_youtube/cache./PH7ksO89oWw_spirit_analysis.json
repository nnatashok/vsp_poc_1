  "spiritsExplanation": "The dominant spirit of the workout video is Soothing & Restorative, supported by the focus on guided breathing. Keywords like 'guided breathing,' 'awakening your nervous system', and the emphasis on breathwork have strong connotations of stress reduction, relaxation, and healing, indicative of a high 0.95 score. The channel's description underscores themes of wellness and holistic approaches, further reinforcing this spirit. \n\nFlow & Rhythm is a secondary spirit involved in guided, coordinated breathing patterns, aligning with descriptions of breathing courses and techniques. There is a moderate emphasis on movement and flow through breathing rhythms, but the focus is not as pronounced as the restorative elements; hence it is rated at a 0.6 score. \n\nHigh-Energy & Intense and Sport & Agility were excluded because the video doesn't suggest vigorous activity or athletic training. Similarly, Structured & Disciplined is less relevant since the primary focus is on guided, intuitive breathing over rigid protocols. Outdoor & Adventure is not applicable as the activity is indoor breathwork."
