  "vibesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as \"The Firestarter\" with a strong score of 0.9 due to its description and tags highlighting an \"insane 15-minute spin bike workout\" and mentions of HIIT, which are indicative of the vibe's characteristics: fast, explosive, and electrifying. The title explicitly uses the word \"insane,\" suggesting high intensity and short, devastating effort typical of this vibe.\n\nAdditionally, the workout embodies \"The Endorphin Wave\" with a score of 0.7. The comments reflect positive emotional experiences and long-term engagement, such as \"doing this 3x a week & I feel so good!\" and \"finding this exercise best for my bad knee,\" aligning with the endorphin-releasing and feel-good elements of this vibe.\n\nThe overall vibe confidence is high at 0.85, as the metadata strongly supports the inclusion of both high-intensity characteristics and a positive, uplifting impact expressed by viewers. Other vibes such as \"The Meditative Grind\" or \"The Zen Flow\" were excluded due to the intense and quick nature of the workout, which contrasts with slower, more prolonged activities typical of those vibes."
