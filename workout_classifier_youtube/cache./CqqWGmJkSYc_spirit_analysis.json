  "spiritsExplanation": "The dominant spirit for this workout video is \"Structured & Disciplined\" with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is evident from the description and tags, which emphasize a progressive training protocol for beginners to learn calisthenics through a methodical approach - targeting every muscle group, and providing progressions for skills like handstands and planches. The channel's focus on coaching and detailed workout routines further supports this classification.\n\n\"Flow & Rhythm\" is assigned with a moderate score of 0.5, as calisthenics inherently involves smooth, bodyweight transitions and coordination, albeit less emphasized in the title and description.\n\n\"Sport & Agility\" receives a score of 0.4 due to elements of skill development (e.g., muscle-ups, levers), involving performance and agility aspects. However, this isn't the primary focus, so it's rated lower.\n\nOther spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Soothing & Restorative\" are excluded due to lack of intensity or recovery-focused language. \"Outdoor & Adventure\" is also irrelevant given the indoor, bodyweight nature of the workout. Overall, the well-defined routine supports a structured and disciplined spirit primarily."
