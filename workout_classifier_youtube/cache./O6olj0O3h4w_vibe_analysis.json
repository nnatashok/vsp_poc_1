  "vibesExplanation": "The workout vibe was classified primarily as 'The Comfort Moves' with a strong score of 0.7, supported by the video targeting beginners and emphasizing a gentle approach to HIIT (\"Gentle BEGINNERS HIIT Workout\" in the title). User comments also underscore the beginner-friendly and achievable nature of the workout, indicating a safe and comfortable environment. 'The Foundation Builder' is also a relevant vibe with a score of 0.6 due to the focus on basic exercises and foundational movements (e.g., squats, lunges) that strengthen weak points and perfect the basics, which are crucial for beginners as per the description. Meanwhile, 'The Meditative Grind' receives a moderate score of 0.5 as the repetitive, structured nature of the workout with 30-second intervals for both work and rest may invoke a rhythmic and focused exercise session. Although HIIT is involved, the gentle and beginner-friendly approach diverges from more intense vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Adrenaline Rush', hence they are not included."
