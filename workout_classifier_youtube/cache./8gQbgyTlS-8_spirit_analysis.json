  "spiritsExplanation": "The video 'How to Start Calisthenics at Home for Beginners (No Equipment)' predominantly embodies the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. The focus on a 'simple routine,' emphasis on 'basic movements,' and the importance of 'form over speed' indicate a methodical approach designed to guide beginners effectively, scoring 0.8. The routine's instructions to begin with 'low reps and gradually increase as you get stronger' also reflect a progressive training structure. Additionally, the incorporation of 'rest days' into the routine adds a 'Soothing & Restorative' element, emphasizing recovery and gradual strength gains, which accounts for a moderate score of 0.5 for this spirit. There is limited emphasis on physical relaxation or meditation typical of more recovery-focused sessions, hence its lower score compared to 'Structured & Disciplined.' The lack of high-intensity, rhythm-based, or outdoor elements rules out other spirits."
