  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty for this workout is assessed as Beginner to Intermediate. The workout consists primarily of cycling on a stationary bike, which generally does not require complex coordination or balance, making it accessible for beginners. However, the mention of 'high intensity intervals' suggests a need for some coordination to follow the prescribed tempo and intervals, elevating it to an Intermediate level for less experienced users. There are no indications of highly technical movements that would classify the technique as Advanced.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.75,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is primarily classified as Challenging due to the high intensity intervals within the 25-minute session. The description and comments highlight the high energy demands of the workout, suitable for a 'challenging, high energy and high intensity session.' However, due to the relatively short workout duration of 25 minutes, which keeps it from being classified as 'Extreme,' a Moderate classification is also applicable, especially for slightly more fit beginners.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level spans Beginner to Advanced. While the technique is mostly beginner-friendly, the high intensity and focus on interval training indicates that some baseline fitness is beneficial. The inclusion of interval training suggests that complete beginners might find it challenging, but the short overall duration keeps it accessible to determined novices. However, the intense intervals will be more suitable for Intermediate users, and Advanced users would benefit from the workout as a moderate challenge. The video's history of helping users improve, as noted in the comments, supports this wide range of applicability."
