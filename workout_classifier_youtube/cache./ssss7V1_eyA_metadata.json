    "Everything has been hitting me all at once lately. Financial stress, work-life stress, emotional stress, etc. But I decided to try this meditation during my lunch instead of sitting and not doing anything (because I don&#39;t have money for lunch). It helped improve my mood drastically.<br><br>Edit to update: Things have gotten better. I quit my old job and started another one closer to home. My boyfriend also works there, so we are saving money on gas, plus this job pays more since it is overnight. Things are really starting to work out for us. Now we are looking for land to move out trailer on and build the house we want.<br><br>Edit 2 (08/08/2022): We did it! We got a house! We had to move and therefore move jobs, but we did it. Now we have a cat room and a guest room in addition to our own bedroom. We don&#39;t have a washer and or dryer yet, but that will come in time. Depression and anxiety still kick my butt though, especially lately.. probably just buyers remorse or something.",
