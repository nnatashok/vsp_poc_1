  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified as 'Yoga' with very high confidence, due to explicit references in the metadata. The title and description emphasize 'Flow - Day 20' within a yoga series, suggesting a structured yoga session. The repeated use of the word 'yoga' in tags such as 'home yoga', '30 Day yoga journey', and 'yoga practice' strongly indicates yoga-focused content. The channel, 'Yoga With Adriene', is dedicated primarily to yoga, reinforcing this classification. Comments referring to phrases like 'breathe' and 'Namaste' are typical of yoga sessions, supporting the high confidence score. The absence of terms associated with other categories, such as 'HIIT', 'pilates', or 'weight workout', excludes them from consideration."
