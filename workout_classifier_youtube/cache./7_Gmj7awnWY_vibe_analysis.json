  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Reboot Workout' with a strong score of 0.9. This is supported by the video's focus on relaxation, stretching, and muscle decompression after intense exercise, which is characteristic of a session designed for recovery and refreshment. Phrases like 'refreshing post-workout stretch,' 'increase your flexibility and decompress,' and 'relieve tight muscles' in the description align closely with the idea of a restorative and low-stress workout.\n\nAdditionally, the vibe 'The Comfort Moves' is relevant, scoring 0.7. This is inferred from the comments highlighting a soothing and gentle experience ('This stretch felt sooooo good') and the environment described in the comments ('pug lying in the background'), suggesting a comforting and cozy atmosphere.\n\nThe emphasis on injury prevention and stretching is also consistent with 'The Foundation Builder,' but this was not chosen as the primary vibe due to the focus on relaxation and stress relief over strength or corrective work."
