  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"8 Minute 'Good Morning' Pilates Stretch\" from Well+Good doesn't explicitly mention the need for any specific equipment. The tags such as \"at home pilates workout\" and \"morning stretch workout\" suggest that it is a low-impact routine fit for performing with minimal requirements, likely just body movements. The description emphasizes a 'stretch routine' that can be done 'in your pajamas,' further indicating that no equipment like a mat is necessary. The comments indicate users performing the stretches at home daily without mention of any equipment, reinforcing the assumption this is a bodyweight-only workout. Therefore, no equipment is classified as needed for this Pilates routine."
