  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Mat' with a score of 0.75. This decision is based on the title mentioning a 'standing' home cardio workout, indicating exercises performed without equipment, likely on a mat. The video's focus on a low-impact, beginner-friendly workout further suggests an emphasis on light movements typically done in a mat setting. \n\n'Body weight' is also selected with a score of 0.5. The description and channel focus on a holistic exercise approach with elements of body weight and cardio workouts. While there is no explicit reference to specific body weight exercises, the nature of a standing cardio workout often involves body weight movements.\n\nOther categories such as 'HIIT' or 'Weight workout' were not chosen due to the lack of intensity cues or equipment usage in the metadata. Comments reflecting user experiences also reinforce the idea of a beginner-friendly, accessible workout, supporting the classifications without indications of other workout types."
