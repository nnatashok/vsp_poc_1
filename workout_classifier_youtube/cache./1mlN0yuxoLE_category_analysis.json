  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is clearly focused on calisthenics, as indicated by the title 'Calisthenics for Complete Beginners' and supported by tags such as 'calisthenics', and 'bodyweight training'. The channel description further confirms this focus on 'Bodyweight Strength Training'. This provides strong explicit evidence for classifying the workout under 'Calisthenics' with a high confidence score of 0.9. Additionally, a secondary category of 'Body weight' is appropriate, as calisthenics often involves bodyweight exercises, which is reinforced by tags like 'bodyweight workout' and 'bodyweight training'. Although the video content covers exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, and other fundamental bodyweight exercises, the primary emphasis is on the calisthenics method. Given the comprehensive coverage of forming routines and exercise forms specifically tailored for beginners, this classification as a foundational workout type is highly appropriate."
