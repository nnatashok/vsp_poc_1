  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The guided meditation technique is primarily beginner-level as the session involves relaxation and visualization, which typically require minimal physical coordination or complex movement. The task is largely to follow verbal instructions and become mentally focused. The tags and description suggest it as a guided meditation focused on spirituality and connection rather than physical movement or complex yoga poses. Some users with slightly more meditation experience might find intermediate appeal due to mental focus and intuitive listening, marginally increasing the technique difficulty score to Intermediate.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The session is designed for relaxation and mental engagement, suitable for beginners who are new to meditation as it involves no physical exertion. Beginner fitness level receives a strong score, supporting users unfamiliar with meditation. Intermediate level is included due to the potential mental discipline required to maintain focus for the full session, which might slightly challenge those with little previous meditation experience. However, since the activity remains low-effort and lacks demanding technique, it remains largely accessible to newcomers."
