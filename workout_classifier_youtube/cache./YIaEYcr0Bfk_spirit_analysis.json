  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is categorized as 'Flow & Rhythm' due to its focus on a series of exercises like V sits, sun bathing knee tucks, and scissor kicks that suggest continuous, fluid movement. The repeated emphasis on exercises feeling 'so good on the body' and encouraging movement when short on time aligns with a flow-centric approach. This spirit was scored 0.7 for its noticeable fluid elements.\n\n'Structured & Disciplined' is applicable as the workout features a named sequence of specific exercises, indicating organized and planned sessions. The description of exercises such as \"V sit row\" and \"side plank side booty from kneeling\" showcases a methodical approach, earning it a score of 0.75.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is evident from comments about the workout's ability to relieve stress and anxiety and its suitability for maintaining exercise despite a foot injury, which aligns with recovery focus. The encouragement to \"focus on yourself in a restorative way\" supports this, warranting a score of 0.6. \n\n'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to lack of relevant athletic or outdoor elements in the workout.\"}"
