  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category 'Weight workout' (score: 1.0) was chosen due to the explicit emphasis on using heavy dumbbells for this workout, as stated multiple times in the description, such as 'LIFT HEAVY!!!' and 'MOST EFFECTIVE WITH HEAVY DUMBBELLS'. The detailed exercise list, including movements like Romanian Deadlift, Squat, and Chest Press, also signifies conventional strength training using weights. The channel's focus on strength training and building muscle supports this categorization. \n\nThe secondary category 'Body weight' (score: 0.2) has a minimal presence as the description mentions the use of body weight in terms of the relative weight lifted, suggesting modifications that could involve some body weight techniques without the bench. However, it's a minor aspect compared to the weight focus.\n\nOther categories such as 'Mat', 'HIIT', or 'Calisthenics' were excluded due to lack of focus on bodyweight exercises or high-intensity intervals, confirming that traditional strength training with weights is the primary activity."
