    "These are some of my favorite workouts from your channel! \u2764\ufe0f You should do a stretching/flexibility workout challenge in the future! I&#39;m sure that would benefit a lot of people as we don&#39;t always prioritize stretching as much as we should.\ud83d\udc9c",
    "I&#39;m a guy and started doing this, and just realized my flexibility is 0 lol so glad I&#39;ve found this channel, hopefully I can sort this through with time.",
    "Love that it\u2019s raining where I am and I\u2019m doing the day 11 video. Thanks for posting this. I\u2019m on the road to staying consistent with workouts and moving my body. Let\u2019s do this team!",
    "I needed this so bad today \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc Loving these stretches, going back to the basics is always a good idea no matter your flexibility level! Thanks Maddie  \ud83d\udc97",
    "this channel is the reason I&#39;m able to do the splits. I learned it two years ago and have just kept stretching since. I fell in love with not only moving my body, but also allowing myself to calm down and just breathe. Balance is everything. Thank you so much, Maddie you&#39;ve literally changed my life \u2764\ufe0f"
