  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under 'HIIT' with a high confidence score of 0.9 due to numerous strong indicators in the metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'HIIT' and describes the workout as 'intense,' aligning well with the high-intensity interval training characteristics. The description reinforces this, mentioning high energy, intense routines, and significant calorie burn (90 kcal in 10 minutes), typical of HIIT workouts. Furthermore, tags such as 'hiit,' 'high intensity,' and 'calorie burn' support this classification.\n\nA secondary classification under 'Mat' is considered with a moderate confidence score of 0.4. The description and comments suggest exercises such as high knees and plank jumps, which are bodyweight exercises often performed on a mat. This is supported by tags like 'no equipment' and 'k\u00f6rpergewicht' (bodyweight). However, the primary focus on cardiovascular intensity and interval structure makes 'HIIT' the predominant category."
