  "title": "15-Minute Guided Meditation to Reset Your Nervous System",
  "description": "Join me for a 15-minute guided meditation to reset your nervous system through some simple techniques that tone the vagus nerve. You can practice this guided meditation seated or lying down. You'll be placing your hands on different parts of your body and breathing easily. Over-the-ear headphones will make the first part of this meditation difficult to practice, so I recommend no headphones or using earbuds. No prior meditation or yoga experience required. Practice anytime you would like to quickly calm or balance your mind and body.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f DONATE: https://paypal.me/carenbaginski\n Consider donating so that I may continue to make more free meditations available to all. \n\n\ud83c\udf3f MORE GUIDED MEDITATIONS \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmWz_om3j9svx5Y6JKX87ACjasRonF0ci \n\n\ud83d\udcd8 MY BOOK: Restorative Yoga: Relax.

    "I have been meditating for years but with 5 chronic health conditions I am often stuck in fight or flight. My holistic gp asked me to focus more on my meditation and lowering my stress as much as possible. Today was the 2nd day in a row I&#39;ve done your meditation and it&#39;s by far had the biggest impact on my stress levels. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f"
