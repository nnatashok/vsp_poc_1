  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified under 'Breathing exercises' due to multiple explicit references to various breathing techniques. The title, 'Powerful Nose Breathing Exercises,' and the description detailing rounds of '60 Breaths Per Round' heavily emphasize breathwork. The tags such as 'breathing exercise,' 'breath of fire,' and 'pranayama,' along with comments about the exercise's impact on well-being, support a high confidence level that the video focuses on breathwork. The inclusion of guided rhythmic breathing and multiple types of breathwork methods in the description and tags further corroborate this category. The secondary category, 'Meditation,' is chosen based on the video featuring an end section on 'Meditation Time,' implying a component of mindfulness or mental relaxation. The reference to meditation in tags such as 'transcendental meditation' and user comments supporting relaxation confirm its moderate presence."
