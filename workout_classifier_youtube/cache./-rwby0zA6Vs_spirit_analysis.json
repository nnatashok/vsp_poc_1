  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.9. This is due to its gentle, rehabilitative nature, specifically designed for stroke patients focusing on recovery and strengthening mobility. The title, description, and tags like 'leg exercises for stroke patients' and 'stroke recovery' clearly emphasize a restorative focus, aimed at helping users regain strength and confidence at their own pace, guided by a physical therapist.\n\nAdditionally, the workout carries elements of being 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.7. The session is led by a professional instructor, follows a clear routine, and offers modifications for individualized needs, which suggests a methodical approach appropriate for people at different stages of recovery. The mention of focusing on specific muscle groups like 'glutes, hips, and ankles' further indicates a structured training protocol designed to progressively improve mobility. Comments from viewers who are recovering or working with stroke patients corroborate the workout's rehabilitative intent.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Flow & Rhythm,' 'Sport & Agility,' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' were excluded due to lack of emphasis on vigorous activity, athletic training, or outdoor elements."
