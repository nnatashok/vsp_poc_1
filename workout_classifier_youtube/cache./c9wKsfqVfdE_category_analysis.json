  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Meditation' with a high score of 0.9 due to clear indications throughout the metadata. The title 'Enter a Deep Sleep while Connecting to your Higher Self (Guided Meditation)' and repeated tags such as 'guided meditation', 'meditation', 'sleep meditation' strongly emphasize meditation as the core activity. Furthermore, the description describes a 'guided meditation' focusing on 'inner peace', 'rejuvenation', and 'connecting to your higher self', all characteristic of meditation practices designed for introspection and mindfulness. The channel 'Great Meditation' reinforces this as it specializes in creating original guided meditations, further supporting the classification.\n\n'Breathing exercises' is considered with a low score of 0.3 due to the common association of breathing techniques within meditation practices even though it is not explicitly mentioned in the metadata. This slight presence reflects the typical inclusion of controlled breathing in guided meditations for relaxation purposes. Other categories were excluded as there are no indicators of physical exercises, making 'Meditation' the best fit."
