    "My muscles were sore, but I really wanted to do some form of cardio after my strength workout. That\u2019s when I found this 15-minute, beginner-friendly, moderate-to-low-intensity workout on your channel. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to exercise, but your words motivated me to push through\u2014and before I knew it, the 15 minutes were over! I\u2019m so grateful for your content. I never thought I would try running, but because of your workouts, I\u2019ve started incorporating short runs too. The way you coach makes it feel like you\u2019re right there in front of me, guiding me. Keep up the amazing work!",
    "I absolutely love this video. I&#39;ve been doing it all week. I started getting really bored with long distance running on a treadmill and nothing could keep my attention or motivation. Doing interval running like this really helps me stay focused and I feel like I have a great workout in a lot less time!!!",
    "Coach Rachael, I think you&#39;re an amazing instructor. I haven&#39;t been active for at least the past 7 years and I wanted to change that. Of all the YouTube instructors I&#39;ve tried, you&#39;ve helped me stay focused the entire time. It&#39;s the second time I&#39;m doing your video this week and I&#39;m surprised how much easier it is. Looking forward to next time, thank you!",
    "I needed to build up to 1 hr a day for my health goal. Where we live now isn&#39;t the best place for outside running so we have a treadmill... I&#39;m sooooo glad I found these running videos! There&#39;s also so many to build on! Plus the positive encouragement that reminds you that you&#39;re headed in the right direction despite other voices :) THANK YOU!",
    "I love this workout as a beginner at running. I keep coming back to it"
