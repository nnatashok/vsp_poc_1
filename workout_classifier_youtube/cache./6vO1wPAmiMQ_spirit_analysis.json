  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata strongly suggests that the workout spirit is 'Soothing & Restorative.' The title 'Guided Meditation For Anxiety & Stress, Beginning Meditation, Guided Imagery Visualization' clearly emphasizes a focus on reducing anxiety and stress, which is aligned with restorative practices. The tags such as 'guided meditation for anxiety,' 'stress relief meditation,' and 'relaxation meditation' further reinforce this restorative and healing focus. \n\nThe description mentions 'wishing you better sleep, peaceful meditations,' and 'unlock peace, healing,' which directly correlate with relaxation and stress reduction. Additionally, the channel focuses on sleep meditation music, further supporting the idea that the content is oriented towards relaxation and restoration. \n\nComments like users using the meditation for therapeutic purposes and the mention of positive life impact through calming practices highlight the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded since the elements associated with them (e.g., intensity, competition) are not present."
