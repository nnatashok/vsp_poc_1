  "vibesExplanation": "**The Zen Flow (Score: 0.9)**: This vibe is highly suitable for the workout because '5 min Yoga for Good Posture' emphasizes grounding, intentional, and breath-centered exercises, which are elements associated with Zen Flow. The description focuses on spine extension, flexion, and core strength with specific poses like 'cat and cow' and 'cobra pose', typical of a calming, deliberate yoga practice. The mention of 'consistency' and being 'really focus' highlights a meditative quality.\n\n**The Foundation Builder (Score: 0.7)**: The workout's focus on correcting 'bad posture' and improving 'spinal alignment' supports classifying it under 'The Foundation Builder' vibe. It involves strengthening foundational elements like posture and spine health, which are critical to addressing weak points and maintaining body fundamentals.\n\n**The Reboot Workout (Score: 0.5)**: Although less strong, this vibe is introduced by the low-intensity and restorative nature of these exercises, aimed at refreshing and gently stretching the body rather than enabling high-intensity activity. The video's purpose of addressing 'back pain relief' aligns with a gentle, refreshing approach, suggesting a mild reboot vibe."
