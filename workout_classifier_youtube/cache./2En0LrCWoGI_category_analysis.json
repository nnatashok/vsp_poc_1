  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under the 'Pilates' category with a score of 1.0, reflecting very high confidence. The title and description explicitly reference a 'full body Pilates workout,' which strongly indicates the workout's nature. Tags such as 'pilates workout for beginners,' 'pilates full body workout,' and 'beginner pilates' further reinforce this classification. Additionally, the channel is hosted by a certified Pilates instructor, adding credibility to the categorization. \n\nThe secondary category is 'Mat,' with a score of 0.6, reflecting a moderate presence. The description notes that the workout requires 'no equipment, just you and your mat,' indicating that the exercises are performed on a mat without additional equipment. However, the main focus remains Pilates, thus a lower score for the 'Mat' category. Other categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Body weight' were not selected due to the absence of direct references or significant emphasis in the metadata."
