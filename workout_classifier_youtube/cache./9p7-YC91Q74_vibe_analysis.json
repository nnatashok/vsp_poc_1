  "vibesExplanation": "The workout primarily fits 'The Firestarter' vibe due to its short duration (10 minutes) and intense focus on training the abs, which aligns with the explosive and impactful nature of the session. The workout's popularity and the phrase 'perfect abs' suggest a quick, high-intensity routine designed to deliver results efficiently, justifying a score of 0.7. Additionally, the use of fast-paced, energetic background music implies an electrifying atmosphere typical of Firestarters.\\n\\nA secondary vibe of 'The Masterclass Workout' is applicable due to the detailed breakdown of abs components in the description and the targeted exercises listed in the comments (e.g., 'Scissors Leg Raise,' 'Leg Raise to Hip Up'). This indicates a technique-driven approach to ensure an effective workout, which is characteristic of a Masterclass vibe, thus receiving a score of 0.6.\\n\\nThere is no indication of a meditative or zen-like element, excluding such vibes, and no competitive or gamified aspect is presented to suggest 'The Competitor' or similar vibes. Confidence is high due to clear indicators in the metadata and comments."
