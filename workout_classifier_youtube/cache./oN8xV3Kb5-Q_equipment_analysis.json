  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video focuses on Box Breathing, a relaxation exercise aimed at reducing anxiety and stress through controlled breathing techniques. The title, description, and tags emphasize the breathing method as a form of meditation practiced by Navy SEALs, and do not mention any physical equipment needed to perform the exercise. Comments from viewers highlight its calming effects and simplicity, further suggesting that no external equipment is necessary. Typically, such breathing exercises can be performed while seated comfortably, without the requirement of specific props or equipment. Therefore, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, requiring no additional equipment."
