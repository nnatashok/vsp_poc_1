  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily a 'Pilates' workout, as explicitly indicated by the title ('30 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT || At-Home Beginner Pilates') and heavily emphasized in the tags (e.g., 'pilates workout full body', 'beginner pilates'). The channel description further supports this classification, highlighting the instructor's certification and focus on Pilates. The score of 0.9 reflects the strong presence and central role of Pilates in the video.\n\nThe 'Mat' category is also relevant, as the workout is performed on an exercise mat without any equipment, as indicated by the description which states \"no equipment,\" aligning with general floor exercises on a mat. Additionally, the link to a mat shop in the description suggests the use of a mat, justifying the score of 0.7.\n\nOther potential categories like 'Yoga' or 'Weight workout' are excluded due to a lack of explicit indicators in the metadata, focusing mainly on Pilates-specific exercises."
