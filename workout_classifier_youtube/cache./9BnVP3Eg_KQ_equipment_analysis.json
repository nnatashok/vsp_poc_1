  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video description explicitly states, \"No equipment needed,\" indicating that the workout is designed to be performed using bodyweight exercises only. Tags and comments do not mention any specific equipment either, focusing instead on the intensity of the workout and its suitability for home environments. The emphasis on 'high-intensity interval training' and 'LES MILLS GRIT Cardio' suggests the workout involves rapid, bodyweight aerobic exercises rather than weighted or equipment-based training. Thus, the confidence score for 'No equipment' being required is very high (1.0), supporting the classification that the workout is entirely bodyweight."
