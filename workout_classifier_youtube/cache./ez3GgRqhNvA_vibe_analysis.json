  "vibesExplanation": "The video 'A Ten Minute Guided Meditation to Clear Your Mind' from the 'Great Meditation' channel is easily classified under 'The Zen Flow' vibe, which corresponds to grounding, intentional, breath-centered, and unhurried practices. The title directly mentions 'guided meditation,' and the description explains an emphasis on relaxing, being present, and focusing on breath to clear the mind, all quintessential elements of a Zen Flow. The score of 0.95 reflects the strong alignment with these elements.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Deep Recharge' vibe is appropriate because the content aids in resetting the mind and alleviating stress, providing a calming effect. This is supported by comments expressing renewal and readiness for the day. A score of 0.75 was assigned due to these elements providing emotional calmness and reset.\n\nFor 'The Sleep Prep', although not explicitly aimed at preparing for sleep, meditation serves as an effective tool to reduce stress and tension, indirectly aiding sleep quality. This scores 0.55, as some comments hint at using it for morning and night routines, but the primary focus isn't sleep-related. Overall, there is high confidence in these classifications due to explicit content descriptions and user feedback."
