  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is primarily beginner level, as the video focuses on simple stretches and strength movements suitable for improving flexibility, particularly targeting hamstrings, hips, and core. These are likely straightforward exercises with a focus on stretching rather than complex movement patterns. The moderate score for intermediate reflects the possibility that some stretching or holding poses might require slightly more coordination or balance.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.75,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is mainly light, suitable for beginners and includes relaxing stretches with gentle holds and dynamic moves. This aligns with the nature of the stretch routine, which is typically not energy-intensive. The duration of 25 minutes warrants a moderate score for effort, as sustaining any activity over this length of time can accumulate to a moderate effort level, particularly for those less conditioned.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is oriented towards beginners and intermediates, given the simple nature of stretches but considering the 25-minute duration, which might be challenging for those new to regular exercise. The advanced score, though lower, accounts for those seeking a more vigorous stretch session or incorporating more challenging progressions as mentioned by commenters noting the 'sweaty stretch' experience."
