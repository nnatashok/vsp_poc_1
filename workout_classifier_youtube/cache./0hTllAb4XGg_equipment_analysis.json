  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"Runner's Yoga - Yoga With Adriene\" implies a yoga session tailored for runners which typically involves a series of floor exercises. The description mentions the practice \"stays low to the ground,\" a hallmark of yoga requiring a mat for comfort and stability during seated or reclining poses. Additionally, as this is a yoga video, it is almost universally expected that a mat would be used to provide a non-slip surface, especially since the tags include 'yoga basics' and 'restorative yoga,' both of which often utilize a mat. Thus, with a very high confidence score of 0.9, a mat is considered essential for this workout."
