  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The beginner classification aligns with the workout\u2019s description as a 'Beginner Pilates' and 'return to basics'. However, due to the 31-minute duration and the presence of exercises noted by users as challenging, it also fits an intermediate level, especially for entirely deconditioned beginners. Pilates can be accessible based on self-paced modifications, explaining why it spans both beginner and intermediate fitness levels."
