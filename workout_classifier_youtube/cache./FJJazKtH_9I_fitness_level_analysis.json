  "techniqueDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is classified as 'Beginner' because the box breathing exercise involves simple, repetitive breathing patterns that do not require complex coordination or advanced physical skills. The metadata describes box breathing as a relaxation technique, which is typically straightforward and accessible to novices. There is no mention of intricate movements or techniques, reinforcing its beginner level classification.",

  ],
  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.85,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as 'Light' since the duration of the exercise is short (6 minutes), and it primarily focuses on controlled breathing. The metadata emphasizes relaxation, stress relief, and anxiety reduction, suggesting a low energy expenditure. This aligns with a light physical demand suitable for relaxation and stress reduction.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.8,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner', with some inclusion for 'Intermediate' and 'Advanced'. The breathing exercise is accessible to all, but the description and comments suggest that benefits increase with practice, forming neural pathways, which aligns with higher fitness levels such as intermediate and advanced. Practicing consistently could lead to more profound effects, which might be perceived as requiring a slightly higher fitness engagement. Multiple comments note transformative effects with consistent practice, which suggests a potential progression in required engagement levels."
