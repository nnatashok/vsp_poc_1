  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned to this workout video is 'Breathing exercises' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is based on the title and description explicitly mentioning 'Deep Breathing exercises,' which indicates a focus on controlled breathing techniques to reduce anxiety, stress, and other discomforts. The video's tags and comments support this classification, as viewers mention benefiting from reduced anxiety and panic attacks, which are common benefits associated with deep breathing exercises. \n\nThe secondary category is 'Meditation,' with a score of 0.7. While the video is primarily focused on breathing, the meditation tag and comments about relaxation imply a meditative component. However, due to the lack of specific indicators of traditional meditation practices, this category is assigned a lower score than breathing exercises. Other potential categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were excluded due to the absence of any related physical movement or postures in the metadata."
