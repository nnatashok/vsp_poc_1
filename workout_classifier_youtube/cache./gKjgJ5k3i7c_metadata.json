    "Thank you, Nicole! I do your workouts five times a week and they keep me feeling energized and alive! You are my absolute favourite! Big \u2764 from Canada \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6",
    "\ud83d\ude0a yes, this is my second day in a row doing yoga.  I&#39;m doing yoga to overcome urges from my addiction so I hope this helps. Thanks may God bless your endeavors in life amen",
    "I can\u2019t explain it. I did this flow last night as a gentle calming low-impact workout due to the day I had. After finishing the workout I felt amazing and super calm, perfect before a shower then sleep. When I woke up the whole day today I\u2019ve felt so much love for everything! The world, my boyfriend, my life, just gratitude and love literally flowing out of my soul. I was trying to think of why I felt this way and then I remembered I did this video the night before. It\u2019s amazing and soul lifting. I love love love Nicole\u2019s videos but this flow hit different. Thank you so much Nicole \ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d",
