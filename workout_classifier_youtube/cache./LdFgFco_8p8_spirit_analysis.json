  "spiritsExplanation": "The video title and tags strongly suggest a 'High-Energy & Intense' workout spirit, as phrases like 'intense workout', 'high intensity interval training', and 'HIIT with weights' are used to describe the session. The description emphasizes a fat-burning, calorie-torching session, complemented by encouragements to push limits and 'work hard,' which further supports this classification. High confidence (0.9) is assigned due to the clear emphasis on intensity and effort.\n\nAdditionally, there is a 'Structured & Disciplined' element, given the workout's methodical nature, with specified 50-second intervals followed by 10-second rests, indicative of a structured HIIT format. This is scored at 0.75, reflecting the clear structure and disciplined approach necessary to complete the workout.\n\nOther potential spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the absence of elements indicative of a mind-body connection focus or recovery emphasis. The comments further back the intense and challenging nature of the workout, confirming the primary spirits identified."
