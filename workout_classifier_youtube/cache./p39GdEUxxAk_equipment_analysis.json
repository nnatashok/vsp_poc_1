  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"5 Minute Yoga for Back Tension (6 Movements of the Spine)\" on the Yoga With Bird channel focuses on yoga poses aimed at relieving back tension and increasing mobility. It does not mention any specialized equipment beyond general yoga essentials. However, yoga practices typically need a mat for comfort and stability, especially as the description highlights movements such as flexion, extension, and rotations. The inclusion of 'Yoga Mat' in the \"Yoga Essentials\" section of the description supports the necessity of a mat. Thus, the Mat is identified with very high confidence (0.9) as essential equipment for this workout session."
