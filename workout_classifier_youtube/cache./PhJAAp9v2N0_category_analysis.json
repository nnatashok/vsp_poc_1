  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video should be 'Stretching,' with a confidence score of 0.9. The title, '15 min DAILY STRETCH ROUTINE,' and several tags such as 'daily stretch routine,' 'stretching,' 'stretch,' 'stretching routine,' and 'full body stretch,' clearly indicate that the main focus is on stretching. The description reiterates this by emphasizing the routine's purpose for mobility and flexibility, further supporting the stretching category. \n\nA secondary, less pronounced category is 'Yoga,' with a score of 0.3. Although the video is primarily a stretching routine, a few tags mention 'madfit 15 min yoga' and 'quick stretch yoga,' suggesting some overlap with yoga principles or poses. However, due to the primary focus on stretching and flexibility, yoga plays a minor role in this video.\n\nThe channel MadFit often features real-time at-home workouts, but this specific video is clearly centered on stretching, with some indirect references to yoga, resulting in a near-high confidence for the categorization."
