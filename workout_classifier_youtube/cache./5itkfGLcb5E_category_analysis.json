  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily categorized as 'Meditation' based on the title 'Guided Meditation Before Sleep: Let Go of the Day' and the tags such as 'guided meditation', 'sleep meditation', and 'meditation for sleep'. These strongly indicate a focus on meditation practices (confidence score 1). The channel focuses on mindfulness and mental health, supporting this categorization. Additionally, there is an element of 'Breathing exercises' (score 0.7), suggested by the relaxation focus common in meditation videos for sleep, although direct mentions are absent, so it's less prominent. The metadata lacks indicators for other categories like Yoga or Pilates, reinforcing the choice of Meditation as the main category."
