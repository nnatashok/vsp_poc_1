  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this video is 'Breathing exercises', supported explicitly by the title 'Guided Wim Hof Method Breathing' and the repeated emphasis on 'breathwork', 'breathing', 'breathing exercises', and 'breathing techniques' in the tags and description. This signifies a highly focused breathing exercise routine. The score of 1.0 reflects this clear, central purpose. Additionally, 'Meditation' is a secondary category with a moderate-to-high relevance. The description references an 'audiovisual guide that helps you maintain rhythm and pace', entrancing background sounds, and focusing 'on nothing but your breath', which aligns with meditation practices focused on mindfulness and concentration. The presence of relaxing elements and mental focus merits a score of 0.6 for 'Meditation'. Other categories such as 'Yoga' and 'Stretching' were excluded as there is no mention of physical poses or flexibility training."
