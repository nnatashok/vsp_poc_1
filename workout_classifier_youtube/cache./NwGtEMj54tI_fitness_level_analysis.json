  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout focuses on guided breathing exercises aimed at relaxation and better sleep, with no complex movements involved. It specifically mentions gentle breathing techniques that are designed to activate the parasympathetic nervous system for relaxation. Indicators from the description, such as 'gentle', 'guided breathwork', and 'calming music', suggest very simple, low coordination breathing activities. Additionally, there is no use of physical movement or coordination demanding techniques, leading to a strong classification as 'Beginner'.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The session is centered around relaxation through guided breathing exercises intended for calming and facilitating sleep. The description emphasizes inducing a state of relaxation and rest, using words like 'restful sleep', 'soothing rhythm', and 'calm your mind', which suggest very low energy expenditure. The video targets individuals with insomnia, further suggesting a low-intensity activity aimed at relaxation rather than physical exertion, confirmed by user comments noting its effectiveness for calming and sleep.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner', as the technique and effort levels both align closely with entry-level participation. However, given the video's length of over 20 minutes, it's slightly more than brief, suggesting 'Intermediate' engagement may be beneficial for full focus and assimilation of the practice over this period. Comments indicate users with a range of backgrounds, supporting broader accessibility, and the breathing session could serve as a supplementary practice even for those at 'Advanced' levels aiming to incorporate relaxation into their routines. The explicit safety warnings acknowledge those with specific health concerns, slightly influencing the classification upwards."
