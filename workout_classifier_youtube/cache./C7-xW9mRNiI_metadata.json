  "channelDescription": "Quick + effective home workouts that get results! Like stronger than you've ever been kind of results. \n\nI'm Lindsey Bomgren, Certified Personal Trainer + Pre-and-Postnatal Fitness Instructor, and mom of 3 littles. \n\nAs a busy mom, I\u2019m all about quick and effective home workouts! I truly feel that doing the physically hard stuff makes you more capable of handling all the mentally challenging things that come at you daily. I don\u2019t film workout videos to give you six pack abs or a nice butt. I film workout videos because I know fitness makes me a better wife, mother, friend and human and I want to share that with you. \n\nI pray you find the workout inspiration + motivation you were seeking when you stumbled over here. Give me 10-30 minutes of your time today and I bet you\u2019ll come back for more tomorrow!\n\nPray often. Move your body. Eat your veggies. Love others + yourself.\n",

    "Just what I needed after  not getting a good night sleep.  Woke up tired, no motivation. 20 min bodyweight workout, added the 8 min booty workout and 30 overhead marches and I&#39;m ready for the day! Thanks for keeping me motivated and moving!",
    "Love all the options and the 20 minutes no repeat.  Just what this tired and unmotivated  grandma needed.  Thank you!",
    "I did this workout in a hospital room. I\u2019ve been here several days with my son and I needed something to get me moving. Skipped the exercises where you\u2019re on the floor, because of hospital germs.. but still enough of a workout to get my heart pumping. Thanks!",
    "This was the perfect first low intensity workout for me at 18 days postpartum! Feeling so good. Thank you!",
    "Not feeling so hot today but still wanted to move and this was perfect. Thanks team NML!"
