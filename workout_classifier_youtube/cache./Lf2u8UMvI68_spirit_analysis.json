  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is characterized by high intensity, which is explicitly mentioned in the title 'High Intensity Elliptical Cardio Climber HIIT.' This indicates a session focused on maximizing effort and cardiovascular challenge, aligning well with the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit. This spirit is further supported by terms such as 'calorie-burning, heart-pumping intervals' and 'challenge yourself through high levels of resistance' from the description. Therefore, it scores a 0.9 as a very strong match for 'High-Energy & Intense.'\n\nThe workout is also clearly structured, as evidenced by the detailed breakdown of intervals and rests in the description. The mention of specific resistance levels and timed intervals implies a regimented approach that fits the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit. Therefore, it scores a 0.7 due to the clear, methodical structure described in the metadata.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Soothing & Restorative' are excluded due to the workout's focus on intensity and energy, rather than relaxation or recovery. Similarly, 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are not applicable due to the equipment-specific, indoor nature of the session."
