  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title explicitly mentions 'Indoor Cycling Workout,' strongly indicating the need for an exercise bike. Additionally, the description mentions various cycling-specific terms such as 'RPMs,' 'climbs,' and 'sprints,' further pointing towards the use of an exercise bike. The channel name 'Kaleigh Cohen Cycling' and the host's credentials as a certified Spin instructor also suggest the workout is centered on indoor cycling. Therefore, there is very high confidence (1.0) that an exercise bike is required for this workout."
