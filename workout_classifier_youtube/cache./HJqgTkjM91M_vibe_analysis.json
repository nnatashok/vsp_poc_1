  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled 'Guided Meditation with Mooji \u2014 Just Be!' strongly embodies 'The Zen Flow' vibe due to its focus on guided meditation, a practice grounded in breath-centered, intentional, and peaceful experiences. The description emphasizes 'abiding in the natural state of Beingness' and staying 'aware,' which aligns with the grounding and unhurried nature of Zen Flow. This vibe is given a score of 1.0 for its perfect embodiment.\n\nAdditionally, elements of 'The Deep Recharge' vibe are present, scored at 0.8, as the meditation provides a 'nervous system reset' and 'ultra-gentle movement' through mindfulness and reduced engagement with the mind stream, facilitating deep relaxation and mental refreshment.\n\nNo intense physical activity, competition, or high-energy music-related vibes (such as The Warrior Workout or The Nightclub Workout) are relevant, hence were not considered. The confidence level is high (0.95) given the clear alignment of the video's content with these calming and restorative qualities."
