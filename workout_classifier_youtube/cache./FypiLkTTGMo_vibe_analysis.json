  "vibesExplanation": "The video 'Calm - Ease | Guided Meditation by Thich Nhat Hanh' is highly representative of 'The Zen Flow' vibe. The title and description emphasize calmness, ease, and joy, which align perfectly with the Zen Flow's characteristics of grounding, intentional, and unhurried movement, especially within meditation contexts. Tags such as 'breathing meditation' and 'mindfulness meditation' further reinforce this vibe, as they underscore the emphasis on breath-centered and grounding practices specific to Zen meditation traditions.\n\nAdditionally, there is a significant presence of 'The Deep Recharge' vibe. Although the focus is on meditation rather than movement, terms like 'meditation for sleep,' 'calm, ease,' and 'relaxation' suggest that the video offers a nervous system reset and deeply restful experience, fitting The Deep Recharge vibe.\n\nThe very high confidence level is due to the direct mention of meditation, calmness, and Thich Nhat Hanh's reputed mindfulness teachings, all very clear indicators of these vibes."
