  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is best categorized as 'Calisthenics' with a score of 0.95 due to numerous strong indicators: the title '15 MIN NO REPEAT CALISTHENICS WORKOUT | Beginner Friendly', description, and tags all emphasize 'calisthenics', highlighting exercises focused on building muscle and strength without equipment. The frequent mention of 'calisthenics' in tags such as 'Calisthenics Workout', 'no repeat Calisthenics', and repeated references throughout description confirm its central role. The score reflects very high confidence in this category.\n\n'Body weight' is chosen next with a score of 0.6, as the workout is described as 'no equipment'. This implies exercises rely on the individual's body weight, which aligns with the 'Body weight' category. The term 'strength training at home' from the tags suggests a possible secondary focus on using body weight.\n\nThe absence of references to equipment, specific rhythmic sequences, or mind-body exercises rules out categories like 'Weight workout', 'HIIT', or 'Yoga'. Overall, the evidence strongly supports 'Calisthenics' as the primary category."
