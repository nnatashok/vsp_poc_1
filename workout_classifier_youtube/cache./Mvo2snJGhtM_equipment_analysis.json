  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title and description explicitly state that this is a 'no equipment' workout, multiple times. The inclusion of 'no noise, no impact' in the title suggests exercises are adapted for quiet, non-impactful movements, typically bodyweight. The exercises listed\u2014'Prisoner side to side squats', 'Explosive halo slam', 'Single leg body saw crunch', 'Alternating knee strikes', and 'Lateral bears + kneel-to-squat'\u2014are all bodyweight exercises that typically do not require any equipment. There are no mentions of equipment in the tags or comments. The video's premise is based on the accessibility of this workout, implying it can be performed without any equipment, reaffirmed by the 'home' and 'no equipment' tags. Therefore, the workout appears to require no equipment."
