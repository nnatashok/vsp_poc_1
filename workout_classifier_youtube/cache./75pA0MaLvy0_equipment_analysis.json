  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Full Body Stretching Exercises - Stretching For Beginners!' does not appear to require any specific equipment based on its metadata. The use of the phrase 'full body stretching exercises' and terms like 'stretching for beginners' suggest exercises focused on flexibility and mobility, which typically involve primarily bodyweight movements. There is no explicit mention of equipment such as mats, blocks, or any other props in the title, description, or tags. The comments emphasize the gentle nature of the movements and the focus on flexibility without indicating any equipment use. Therefore, the workout is likely designed to be performed without any equipment, using bodyweight only."
