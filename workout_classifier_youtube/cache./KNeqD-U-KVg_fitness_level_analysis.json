  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The exercises listed in the comments and suggested by the tags and description such as 'hip rotations,' 'butterfly stretch,' 'lunge + push knee out,' 'pigeon pose,' and 'downward dog' are generally common stretching and yoga positions requiring minimal to moderate complexity. These movements typically require some degree of coordination and balance, particularly for stretched poses like pigeon pose and downward dog, which justify a Beginner to Intermediate classification. The title and description emphasize this video as a 'Full Body Stretch' aimed at 'improve mobility & flexibility' with a 'rest day' implication indicating simplicity in technique.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 15-minute full body stretch which primarily focuses on mobility and flexibility with no equipment required. The 50 seconds of activity with 10 seconds rest suggests a gentle pace suitable for a recovery or rest day. This format emphasizes light physical effort with a possibility of moderate effort if performed with deeper stretches. The comments and description imply it's used to recover and is accessible even to those with joint stiffness, indicating overall low energy expenditure.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the beginner to intermediate technique demands and the light to moderate effort difficulty, this workout is most suitable for beginners, although it can accommodate intermediates comfortably. The mention of stretching for those with previously stiff joints or users recovering from exercise implies accessibility for beginners and intermediates seeking gentle activity. Advanced users might find utility in the routine on active recovery days or for mobility enhancement, hence a light association. Multiple fitness levels are included to reflect versatility and adjustments users can make based on their capability."
