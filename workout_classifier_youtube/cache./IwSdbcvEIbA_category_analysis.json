  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category 'Pilates' was chosen due to multiple explicit mentions in the title, tags, and description, as well as the channel's focus on Pilates ('50 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT || At-Home Pilates', 'pilates workout', 'at-home pilates'). The high score of 0.95 reflects the central theme of the workout being a pilates routine, aiming at a full body workout, which is reinforced by mentions in the description and user comments ('pilates classes', 'best on YouTube').\n\nThe secondary category 'Mat' was selected because the workout is performed without additional equipment, other than a mat ('no equipment needed', 'yourself and a mat'). This aligns with the concept of mat-based exercises. The score of 0.7 reflects that while the mat aspect is a significant element, it is not as defining as the Pilates focus."
