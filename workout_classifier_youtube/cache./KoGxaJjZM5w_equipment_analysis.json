  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video metadata strongly indicates that dumbbells are required for this workout. In the description, exercises like \"DB thrusters,\" \"Bicep curls,\" \"Single DB front raises,\" \"Sumo goblet squat,\" and \"Tricep extensions\" explicitly mention the use of dumbbells (DB). Additionally, the description advises focusing on lifting weights with good form, further implying the need for dumbbells to perform these strength exercises. The inclusion of 'kettlebell' in the tags does not reflect the equipment actually used in the workout, as none of the exercises listed typically involve kettlebells according to the description. The confidence level is set at 0.9 due to the explicit mention of exercises requiring dumbbells in the video."
