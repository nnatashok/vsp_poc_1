  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty of this guided breathing workout is primarily 'Beginner'. The video involves breathwork, which typically consists of straightforward actions that primarily require mental focus rather than complex physical movements. Breathing exercises generally require minimal physical coordination, but may require some mental control and awareness, which aligns well for 'Beginner' users. The reference to sensory directions and holding the breath, as mentioned in the comments, suggests a 'Beginner' level of technique, with a small possibility of 'Intermediate' nuances due to the mental focus required.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.7,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is classified as 'Light'. The session duration is under 20 minutes and consists mainly of breathwork, which involves low energy expenditure and is typically not physically demanding. There is some mention of holding breath and sensory awareness, which might demand focus, but this does not significantly increase physical exertion. Therefore, it primarily aligns with a 'Light' effort difficulty, with a minor 'Moderate' element due to cognitive and sensory engagement.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulty ratings, the required fitness level is 'Beginner' with some applicability for 'Intermediate'. The nature of breathwork and the comments suggest that users of varying experience can attend, offering an introduction to more focused breathing techniques without demanding significant physical conditioning. The intermediacy comes from the mental and sensory focus noted in user comments, which might offer additional benefit to slightly experienced users seeking deeper practice."
