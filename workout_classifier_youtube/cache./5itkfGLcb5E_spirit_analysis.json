  "spiritsExplanation": "The spirit of 'Soothing & Restorative' is assigned with high confidence, as the video's metadata strongly emphasizes relaxation and emotional recovery. The title 'Guided Meditation Before Sleep: Let Go of the Day' suggests a session aimed at unwinding and releasing daily stress. The description mentions the creator's focus on mindfulness and healing from depression and anxiety, further highlighting the restorative aspect. Tags like 'guided meditation', 'sleep meditation', 'let go of the day', and 'deep sleep meditation' are consistent with a calming, restorative energy. Viewer comments describing emotional relief and reduced anxiety, such as \"Thank you. My anxiety has been bad lately. I needed this\", reinforce the restorative spirit. The absence of high-energy, structured exercise terms in the metadata excludes other potential spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Structured & Disciplined'. This meditation's purpose for relaxation before sleep, evidenced by both title and user feedback, justifies the strong alignment with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit."
