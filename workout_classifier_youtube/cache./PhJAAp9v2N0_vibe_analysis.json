  "vibesExplanation": "The workout is best classified as 'The Reboot Workout' with a high score of 0.8 due to its emphasis on a 'full body stretch' designed for 'flexibility & mobility' which aligns with attributes of this vibe like 'deep stretch, low stress, total-body refresh.' The description highlights its suitability for daily routines and as a refreshing session for mornings or after workouts, suggesting a focus on recovery and gentle maintenance.\n\n'Zen Flow' is selected with a score of 0.7 because the routine has a calming, intentional, and breath-centered approach suitable for morning or bedtime, as indicated by the description and user comments praising its calm and inviting nature.\n\n'Foundation Builder' receives a score of 0.5, reflecting its capacity to improve the basics of flexibility and mobility, key components in strengthening weak points through consistent, gentle exercise.\n\nThe evidence from user comments about its easy integration into daily routines and amenable style further supports these classifications. Potentially high-intensity or dynamic vibes were excluded due to the lack of such elements in the session."
