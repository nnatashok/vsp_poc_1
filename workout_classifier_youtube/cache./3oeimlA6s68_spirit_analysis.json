  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Structured & Disciplined' due to its methodical nature. The video features a sequence of movements each performed for a set duration of 50 seconds with a 10-second rest, as indicated in the description, and target multiple core muscle groups, implying a structured and purposeful approach. The use of specific timings and variety of exercises suggests a well-organized routine, earning a score of 0.8.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also present as the workout encourages maintaining focus on form, particularly with instructions to keep the lower back flat and core braced. The 'follow along' and 'no repeat' format that likely encourages continuous movement without breaks in flow, justifies a score of 0.6 for promoting a rhythmic routine.\n\n'\"Soothing & Restorative\" is mildly applicable because the routine is described as suitable for low-impact days and includes some stretching. It serves to maintain activity on rest days without heavily taxing the body, given a moderate score of 0.5. This spirit is less dominant but significant due to its restorative intentions for active rest days."
