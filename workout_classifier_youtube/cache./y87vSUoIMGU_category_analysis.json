  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category of this workout is 'Stretching' with very high confidence (0.95) based on explicit indicators throughout the metadata. The title 'UNWIND 20 Min Full Body Stretch Routine' and description emphasize stretching, featuring a detailed list of stretches including NECK STRETCH, HAMSTRING STRETCH, and CHILD'S POSE. Tags heavily feature stretching terms such as 'stretching exercises', 'full body stretch', and 'flexibility'. Comments also emphasize relaxation and flexibility benefits, further underscoring the focus on stretching.\n\nA secondary category 'Yoga' is present but with lower confidence (0.45). While 'yoga' is mentioned in the tags and a few yoga-inspired poses like 'Downward Dog' and 'Child's Pose' are included, the focus is primarily on stretching rather than a traditional yoga flow. Therefore, the scoring reflects a moderate presence rather than being a central characteristic of the workout.\n\nNo evidence supports including other categories like 'Pilates' or 'Mat' given the specific emphasis on static and dynamic stretches rather than broader mat-based routines."
