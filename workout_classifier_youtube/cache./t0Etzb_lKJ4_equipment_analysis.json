  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title of the video explicitly mentions it as an 'Indoor Cycling Workout,' which clearly indicates the use of an exercise bike. The channel name 'Kaleigh Cohen Cycling' and the channel description, which focuses on 'CYCLE & STRENGTH training programs,' further confirm that cycling is the central activity of this workout. Additionally, the description contains links to cycling shoes, reinforcing that the exercise necessitates an indoor bike setup. Therefore, the confidence in requiring an exercise bike is very high (1.0), as it is essential for performing this workout."
