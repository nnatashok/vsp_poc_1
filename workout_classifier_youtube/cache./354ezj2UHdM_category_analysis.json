  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized as 'Pilates' and 'Mat' based on the consistent use of the term 'pilates' in the title and description, as well as the channel's focus on pilates content. The title emphasizes 'full body pilates workout' and the channel description lists the creator as a 'certified Pilates instructor'. This indicates a very strong presence of Pilates, justifying a high score of 0.95 for this category. Additionally, 'Mat' is relevant as the workout is performed without equipment, suggesting exercises are likely done on the floor typical for mat workouts, giving it a moderate score of 0.6. Comments further reinforce Pilates as a central element by users mentioning their preference for Pilates and completing the Pilates challenge. No explicit mention of other exercise types justifies the exclusion of other categories."
