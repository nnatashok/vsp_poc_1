  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe identified is \"The Reboot Workout\" with a high score of 0.9. This is supported by the focus on mobility, stretching, and low stress activities aimed at refreshing the body, as indicated by phrases like \"5 min stretch routine\" and \"unlocking of tight and sleepy muscles.\" The emphasis on gentle, functional movements that improve joint mobility fits well within the 'reboot' concept.\n\nThe secondary vibe \"The Foundation Builder\" is scored at 0.75 due to the routine's focus on posture correction and mobility improvements in key areas like hips, back, and ankles. The video aims to improve foundational mobility, which aligns with strength and stability at the core of foundation building.\n\nA tertiary vibe, \"The Comfort Moves,\" was assigned a lower score of 0.45. This is because the routine promises improvements that make daily physical activity easier and enhances general comfort, especially given the user comments about improved flexibility and ease of movement.\n\nThe high confidence level of 0.85 is due to specific and clear cues in the description, and how the exercises are presented as gentle yet effective for daily use, without indications of high intensity or pace-driven elements that would suggest other vibes like \"The Warrior Workout\" or \"The Firestarter.\""
