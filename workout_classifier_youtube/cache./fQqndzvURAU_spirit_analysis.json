  "spiritsExplanation": "1. **Structured & Disciplined:** The workout follows a clear, structured protocol with specific intervals and intensity levels, marked by exact timing and intensity descriptions in the session breakdown - including '1 Min Easy (1/10)' and '30s Sprint (9/10)'. This precise structuring, along with the channel's emphasis on training programs and techniques, supports a high score for this spirit (0.8).\n\n2. **Flow & Rhythm:** While the workout is structured, the emphasis on cycling with varying paces and intervals suggests a rhythmic flow. The session includes continuous movement patterns that contribute to the 'flow' sensation typical of cycling workouts. This is supported by the common themes in cycling workouts like 'spin', 'spinning class', and 'flow of movement', earning it a strong but slightly lower score (0.7).\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' were not chosen as the workout is tailored for beginners or those easing back into exercise, lacking the intensity required for this spirit. 'Soothing & Restorative' is also excluded due to the specific interval training and the incorporation of sprints, which are not typical of gentle, restorative practices."
