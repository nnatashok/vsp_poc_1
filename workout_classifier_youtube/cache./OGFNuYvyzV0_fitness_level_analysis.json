  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is classified as \"Yoga for Beginners\" in the tags and is described as a \"gentle session\" targeting conditions like vertigo. This indicates that the movements are likely simple, with minimal coordination required, aligning with a Beginner level. However, yoga generally requires some degree of body awareness, coordination, and balance, which justifies a partial inclusion of the Intermediate level.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique and effort difficulty analysis, the required fitness levels are mostly Beginner, as the session is beginner-friendly and targets conditions requiring caution (e.g., vertigo, TBI recovery). The Intermediate level is partially included because yoga requires a basic level of body awareness and because the channel caters to all levels, suggesting variable modifications may be available."
