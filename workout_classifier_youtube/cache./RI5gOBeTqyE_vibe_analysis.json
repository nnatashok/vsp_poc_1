  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video \"Yoga for Bedtime for More Restful Sleep\" from the \"Breathe and Flow\" channel is highly indicative of 'The Sleep Prep' vibe. This is strongly supported by the title and description which emphasize a \"gentle\" yoga routine specifically designed for \"bedtime\" and \"improved sleep\". Terms like \"wind down,\" \"calm you down,\" and comments about it being a nightly companion underline its role in preparing the body and mind for rest. The presence of tags such as \"yoga for sleep\" and \"night time yoga\" further reinforce this classification, justifying the high confidence level and a score of 1.0.\n\nAdditionally, there is a subtle underlying element of 'The Zen Flow'. This is inferred from the description and comments noting the \"calming voice\" and \"gentle routine,\" which suggests a breath-centered, unhurried practice typical of 'The Zen Flow' vibe. However, given the more dominant sleep-helping focus, this vibe is secondary and rated at 0.6. Overall, these vibes accurately capture the video's aim and content."
