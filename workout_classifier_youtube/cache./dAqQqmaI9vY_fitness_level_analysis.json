  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is described as a beginner-friendly yoga routine, specifically using terms like \"beginner daily yoga routine.\" The exercises include fundamental yoga poses (asanas) like Surya Namaskar, Pawanmuktasana, and Bhastrika pranayama, which are basic in nature. However, poses like Sarvangasana (Shoulder Stand) require a bit more balance and body awareness, typical of intermediate-level practices.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration of 30 minutes with a variety of asanas and pranayamas suggests a moderate effort difficulty. While the video targets beginners, the continuous flow and incorporation of sequences like Surya Namaskar and Kapalbhati pranayama demand a moderate level of physical engagement. The pacing is steady, with calming pranayamas interspersed, which lowers the overall intensity but still presents a challenge for deconditioned individuals.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique and effort levels suggest that the video is suitable primarily for beginners and intermediates due to the relatively straightforward movements and moderate effort involved. However, the duration of 30 minutes and the inclusion of poses like Sarvangasana and pranayamas require slightly more experience and familiarity, which is why the intermediate level is also appropriate. The presence of potentially challenging single poses further justifies including advanced for some users, though the overall beginner-friendly packaging supports fitness levels primarily of beginner and intermediate."
