  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit identified for this video is 'Soothing & Restorative,' with a very high confidence (0.9). The title itself\u2014 '15 MIN Guided Meditation For Manifestation & Success'\u2014indicates a focus on mindfulness and calmness, essential qualities of a restorative workout spirit. The description emphasizes 'conscious stillness' and reconnecting with 'truth and inner fire,' further supporting this classification. Comments from users highlight the meditation's impact on mental health and healing, reinforcing its restorative nature.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is noted with a moderate score (0.4) as meditation often involves a rhythmic quality of breathing and thought, which brings a mind-body connection akin to flow.\n\nOther potential spirits were excluded due to a lack of relevant indicators: there's no focus on intensity, structured exercises, sports, or outdoor activities, which are essential for 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Structured & Disciplined,' 'Sport & Agility,' or 'Outdoor & Adventure' spirits."
