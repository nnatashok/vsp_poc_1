  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a beginner flexibility routine primarily focused on stretching, as indicated by the title, tags, and description. In the description, a specific mat recommended by the creator ('THE MAT I USE') is linked along with a discount offer, strongly suggesting its use during the workout. There is no mention of other equipment that would typically be necessary for stretching routines, such as blocks or straps. Given the emphasis on stretching and the specific mention of a mat, I assigned a very high confidence score of 0.9 for the requirement of a mat."
