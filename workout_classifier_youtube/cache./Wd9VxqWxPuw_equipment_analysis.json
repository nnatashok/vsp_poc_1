  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled \"20 Minute Spin Class Workout (FAT BURNING INDOOR CYCLING!!),\" which strongly implies the necessary use of a spinning or stationary exercise bike. The description further confirms this, stating that the workout is a spin class with intervals of high and low intensity on a 'stationary or spinning bike,' clearly requiring an exercise bike for execution. Additionally, multiple mentions in the tags such as 'spin workout,' 'indoor cycling workout,' and '20 minute spin class workout' further support this. Therefore, the exercise bike is required with very high confidence (0.9) as it is central to performing the workout."
