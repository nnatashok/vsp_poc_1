  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is classified primarily as 'The Warrior Workout' with a strong score of 0.85. This classification is based on several factors: the use of 'HIIT' and 'High Intensity Interval Training' in the title and tags, which suggest a sweat-dripping, heart-pounding workout experience, typical of 'The Warrior Workout'. The description explicitly states the workout was 'INTENSE' and a 'full body burn,' reinforcing this vibe. The mention of 'Les Mills Grits', a well-known intense workout program, further supports this vibe due to its reputation for challenging workouts. Additionally, comments mention the hard work involved and the challenge it presents, aligning with the intensity associated with 'The Warrior Workout'.\n\nThe secondary vibe, 'The Firestarter', is assigned a score of 0.65. The short duration of 10:10 and descriptors like 'intense' and making references to fat burning and losing weight suggest high-impact, explosive workouts typical of 'The Firestarter'. However, 'The Warrior Workout' was favored due to stronger evidence of comprehensive full-body challenges and intensity."
