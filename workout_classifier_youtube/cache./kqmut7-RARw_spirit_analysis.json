  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is characterized by a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit due to the emphasis on a vinyasa flow, which inherently involves smooth and continuous movement patterns. The description mentions a 'full body flow' and includes terms like 'sequence,' 'sun salutations,' and 'vinyasa,' all indicative of this spirit as they highlight coordination and a mind-body connection. The score of 0.9 reflects very high confidence in this assessment. \n\nAdditionally, a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is present, as the workout is described as 'beginner friendly' and 'designed to help you feel like you've given your body everything it needs to have a great day.' Comments from users mention mindfulness and gaining a sense of peace and well-being, which align with restorative aspects. Thus, this spirit receives a score of 0.7.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the lack of language around intensity or athletic performance goals in both the metadata and user comments."
