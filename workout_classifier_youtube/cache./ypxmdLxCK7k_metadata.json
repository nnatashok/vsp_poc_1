    "Ok, this probably will go unnoticed but I want to share this: I\u2019m 41, since I started to do these workouts, I lost 15kgs and my abs line is not that shy anymore! More important, I am feeling much more confident and capable in every aspect of my life. You guys cannot understand how good is to walk on the street in my city (Sydney) and see people looking at you\u2026 it never happened! Why\u2019s that? Because you shine! Thank you all! And remember\u2026 if you don\u2019t have 15 minutes to do this workout, WAKE UP 15 minutes EARLIER!!!",

    "This is actually a really tough workout, I recommend halving what Chris does and start with 10 reps of each exercise. Once you can do all 5 sets of 10, do 11 reps of each exercise, and keep building towards 20. Start at 5 if 10 is still too many, don\u2019t be disheartened by how easy he makes this look, Chris is a damn super hero!",
    "Discipline and consistency are the keys.",
    "I\u2019ve been doing push-ups everyday now for a good couple months. I\u2019m up to 70-80 in one hit, resting a little bit and then doing anywhere between 60-70 again so I\u2019m doing around 150 max within a half hour or so. It really works and I can see my physique has changed and my boss at work noticed that I lost some weight! Thank you Chris and to all those out there, about 6 months or so I could only do about 40 push-ups in one sitting now I\u2019ve doubled it and feel so much stronger, mixed in with running at least once or twice a week."
