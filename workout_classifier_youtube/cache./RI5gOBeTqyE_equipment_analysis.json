  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"Yoga for Bedtime for More Restful Sleep\" explicitly states in the description that no props or equipment are required. The description emphasizes a gentle yoga routine intended to aid sleep and relaxation, which aligns with practices that typically do not require additional equipment. The use of tags such as \"gentle yoga,\" \"beginner yoga,\" and \"yoga for sleep in bed\" further suggests a minimalistic approach, focusing on simple, accessible poses that can be performed without tools. Given the clear mention of \"no props or anything required,\" the confidence level for no equipment needed is very high, around 0.9."
