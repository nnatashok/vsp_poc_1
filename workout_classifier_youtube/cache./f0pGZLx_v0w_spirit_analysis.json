  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this video is 'Soothing & Restorative,' as it focuses on breathwork, which is inherently calming and intended to 'reset your nervous system,' a key phrase indicating stress reduction and relaxation. The reference to mindfulness courses and the comment about helping someone manage anxiety further supports this classification. Given its calming and therapeutic intent, it scores a 0.9, indicating a very strong match.\n\nA secondary spirit is 'Flow & Rhythm.' The user's comment about managing the \"speed at own level\" and the ability to pause for breath holds suggests a rhythmic, customizable flow to the session, which aligns with the way breathwork can require a conscious, continuous engagement with breathing patterns. This spirit is less dominant, but still apparent, with a confidence score of 0.7 due to the rhythmic nature of breathwork exercises mentioned.\n\nOther potential spirits such as 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'High-Energy & Intense' are excluded, as the video doesn't focus on high-intensity or strict protocols, but rather on relaxation and personal pacing."
