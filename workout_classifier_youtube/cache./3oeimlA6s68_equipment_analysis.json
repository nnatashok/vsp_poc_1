  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video explicitly states in the description that no equipment is needed for the exercises, which focuses on abs and core. However, it does mention that you should 'grab your mat' for this routine. This is a clear indication that a mat is needed, specifically to ensure comfort and proper support while performing floor exercises. The mention of keeping 'lower back flat on mat' further reinforces the necessity of a mat. Given the repeated reference to a mat and its common use in such workouts, the confidence score for requiring a mat is very high at 0.9."
