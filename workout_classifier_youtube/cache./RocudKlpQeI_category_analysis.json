  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Body weight,' as indicated by both the video title and description, which explicitly mention a 'beginner bodyweight workout.' The exercises listed, such as squats, push-ups, and glute bridges, are classic bodyweight movements, justifying a high score of 0.9 in this category.\n\nThe second category is 'Mat,' supported by the fact that the exercises are likely performed on the floor without any equipment, which is common in mat workouts. However, since the description does not explicitly mention a mat or activities typically associated with this category other than being on the floor, this category receives a score of 0.6 reflecting less dominance compared to 'Body weight.'\n\nThe comments and the video being pegged as suitable for beginners corroborates the classification but provide no additional grounds for other categories. No other major categories such as 'HIIT,' 'Pilates,' or 'Yoga' are suggested by the metadata, making these classifications specific and accurate."
