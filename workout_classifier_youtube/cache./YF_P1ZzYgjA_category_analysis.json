  "categoriesExplanation": "The video 'Daily Calm | 10 Minute Mindfulness Meditation | Forgetting Time' is primarily categorized as 'Meditation' due to explicit evidence present in both the title and description. The title directly mentions 'Mindfulness Meditation,' and the description elaborates on how this session is guided by Tamara Levitt and focuses on mindfulness, which points strongly towards meditation. The tags such as 'meditate' and 'mindfulness' further reinforce this classification. Hence, a score of 1 is assigned to 'Meditation'. \n\nA secondary category of 'Breathing exercises' is considered with a score of 0.4 due to the common association of mindfulness practices with controlled breathing, although it is not explicitly mentioned. Comments support the meditative experience by noting an absence of time awareness and consistent practice, which often involves breathing techniques. However, without direct reference to breathing in the metadata, the presence is only mild."
