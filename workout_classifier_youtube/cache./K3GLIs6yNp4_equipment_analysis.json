  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled \"15 min Abs and Hip Workout | Pilates for Beginners,\" emphasizing that it is a Pilates routine. The description explicitly instructs viewers to \"Roll out your mat and let's get started,\" which indicates the use of a mat is essential for this workout, especially considering the floor-based nature of Pilates. Additionally, the tags include \"mat pilates,\" further reinforcing the need for a mat. Given these indications, the confidence level that a mat is required is very high (0.9). No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the title, description, or tags, suggesting it is a mat-based, bodyweight-only workout."
