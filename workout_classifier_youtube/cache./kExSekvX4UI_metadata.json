    "This is great! I prayed about getting back up to walking and found a link to this site. It covered everything I needed to move away from the wheelchair and walker. Thanks so much for this :)",
    "I got diagnosed with MS at the end of 2023. I did Martial Arts for over 7 years and was extremely flexible. After I quit Martial Arts my flexibility vanished basically over night and my ability to walk started faultering soon after. I need to stretch because my hips, knees and ankles feel so tight constantly.",
    "This is my 3rd journey to walk again I&#39;m so happy I found you guys",
    "OMG.  I have been doing this for the past few days, and  my hips are  feeling like  they&#39;re  brand new.  Such a  simple  fix.<br>  Thank you so much, <br>Dale D&#39;Aiuto",
    "Yeah, I haven&#39;t instantly felt the need to stretch before this moment. My T2 and I thank you."
