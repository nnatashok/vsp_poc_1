  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is 22 minutes long, suggesting a moderate to high effort level, especially with compound exercises targeting multiple muscle groups for building strength and muscle. Comments reveal attempts at completing the workout and mentioning modifications, indicating that while challenging, it is still within reach for motivated beginners or intermediates. The use of dumbbells and the explicit mention of burning calories and fat suggest a moderately demanding session for less fit users, especially given the slow to moderate tempo, which can create significant muscular fatigue.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "This workout offers modifications, making it accessible to beginners, albeit with some difficulty, particularly due to its duration and weight usage. It aligns well with the Intermediate level due to the incorporation of compound movements and the potential intensity from dumbbell use for those with minimal experience. While challenging, motivated beginners can benefit from it, especially if modifications are utilized. Comments from users indicate varied fitness levels attempting the workout, reinforcing its broad applicability. Advanced users might also find it useful due to the potential to increase dumbbell weights and compound nature of the exercises."
