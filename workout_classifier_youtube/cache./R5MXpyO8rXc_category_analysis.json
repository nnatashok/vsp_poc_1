  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is strongly categorized as a \"Weight workout\" due to the explicit emphasis on using moderately heavy dumbbells throughout the session, as noted repeatedly in the title and description. The title \"20 minute Full Body NO REPEAT Workout | Tone and Define with Dumbbells\" and the description both highlight the use of dumbbells and specific weight-related exercises (e.g., Arnold Press, Romanian Deadlift, Tricep Kickbacks). The structured approach of alternating upper and lower body exercises, combined with the specific mention of building muscle definition, further substantiates this categorization. The workout's structure, which includes 18 exercises and a comprehensive full-body focus using weights, aligns with typical characteristics of a weight workout. This provides us with very high confidence in this classification, justifying a score of 0.9. Other categories such as \"Body weight\" or \"HIIT\" are less applicable due to the strong emphasis on dumbbells and absence of interval-specific high-intensity cues."
