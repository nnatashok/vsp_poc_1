  "vibesExplanation": "The video's focus on 'tweaks' and optimizing weightlifting for calorie burning aligns strongly with 'The Progression Quest' vibe. This vibe is characterized by methodical improvement and structured guidance, which is evident from the three-step process described for burning more calories through weightlifting tweaks, such as adjusting weight and reps, utilizing compound exercises, and maximizing muscle engagement. The score of 0.8 reflects the clear strategy-driven approach and emphasis on steady improvement in fat loss and muscle building.\n\nAdditionally, the detailed explanation of exercises, with an emphasis on scientific backing and technique (as seen in Jeremy Ethier's channel focus), aligns closely with 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe, which emphasizes technique-driven, skill-building workouts. The channel's NASM certification and science-focused content further support this categorization, earning a score of 0.7.\n\nWhile elements of 'The Tactical Athlete' or 'The Disciplined Grind' could be inferred due to the structured and disciplined nature of the workout strategies, they are less emphasized due to the primary focus on calculated progress and technique mastery."
