  "spiritsExplanation": "The metadata surrounding \"Waking Up with Sam Harris - Mindfulness Meditation (9 minutes)\" clearly aligns with the \"Soothing & Restorative\" spirit due to several strong indicators. The title explicitly mentions 'Mindfulness Meditation,' emphasizing a calming and restorative process aimed at stress reduction. The description discusses mindfulness practice and aims to provide a better, more examined life, reinforcing a focus on mental clarity and relaxation. Comments from viewers further highlight the tranquility experienced during the session, with remarks about extended meditation sessions and the simple, music-free approach that fades gently. This lack of intensity, combined with its emphasis on simplicity and minimalistic guidance, suggests no alignment with spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Sport & Agility.\" Given the widespread understanding of meditation as a restorative practice, the assignment of \"Soothing & Restorative\" receives a score of 1.0, denoting a perfect match. Confidence in this classification is very high (0.9) due to the clear presence of descriptors associated with relaxation and mindfulness."
