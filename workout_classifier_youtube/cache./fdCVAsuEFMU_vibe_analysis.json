  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video is best classified under 'The Progression Quest' due to its focus on gradually increasing weight as form improves, as indicated by phrases like 'great for building strength/muscle, stability, and stamina' and 'gradually working your way up.' This suggests a long-term improvement strategy, scoring a 0.75 due to strong alignment with the Progressive Quest vibe.\n\n' The Masterclass Workout' vibe is also applicable, as the inclusion of 'basic strength training exercise and an isometric hold simultaneously' suggests a technique-driven approach that combines classic exercises with skill elements, justifying a score of 0.65.\n\nLastly, 'The Disciplined Grind' is a complementary vibe, as the workout\u2019s demand for consistency and execution aligns with this vibe. The high intensity and straightforward strength training focus, coupled with user feedback about consistent workouts, supports a score of 0.6.\n\nThe workout's emphasis on improvement and technique ruled out options like 'The Firestarter' or 'The Nightclub Workout,' which emphasize short explosive energy or dance-based routines."
