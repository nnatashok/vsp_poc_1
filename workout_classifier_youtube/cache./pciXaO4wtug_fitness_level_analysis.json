  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is titled 'Chair Yoga Stretch for Beginners, Seniors & Everyone,' indicating a focus on simple, accessible movements. The description suggests it's easy to follow and suitable for all levels, which aligns with beginner technique difficulty. Comments indicate users felt better or were surprised by the amount of stretching possible, hinting at low complexity. The tag 'Easy yoga' and channel focus on beginner and senior-friendly content further supports beginner classification. Some users may find coordination in certain stretches slightly more demanding, warranting a minor alignment with intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a 30-minute chair yoga session, emphasizing relaxation and gentle stretching, which suggests light effort. The title and tags such as 'Relaxing workout,' 'Seated yoga,' and 'Stress free yoga' imply low energy expenditure. User comments highlight feeling stretched but not strained, indicating that the effort is light. However, the 30-minute duration and descriptions of the video as 'not boring' might present a very mild challenge for users with very low fitness or those new to any physical activity, which provides a slight overlap with moderate effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique difficulty as largely beginner and effort difficulty as light, the workout strongly aligns with a beginner required fitness level. 'Chair Yoga' for 'Seniors & Everyone' is explicitly beginner-friendly, supported by channel content targeting beginners, seniors, and active older adults. However, a very slight alignment with the intermediate level exists due to the possibility of new users underestimating the 30-minute duration, although the light physical demand overall dominates. Tags such as 'Chair yoga for beginners' and descriptions assure users about going at their own pace, reinforcing suitability for beginners while allowing slightly more conditioned users to benefit, hence the minor intermediate classification."
