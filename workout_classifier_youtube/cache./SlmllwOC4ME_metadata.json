    "Yes to verbal cues and no loud music! Lovely! This is the point of pilates, focusing on breathing and mindful movement. Love your videos!! Great job",
    "It\u2019s the best of your video! Your instructions so helpful for focusing and breathing. Thanks!   And please, don\u2019t stop it! It\u2019s a really best way for pilates practice \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",
    "As a 13 year old who had really wanting to be more productive and healthy this was really enjoyable and I\u2019ll do this so much! Thank you! \u2764",
    "I really underestimated the intensity of this workout, but it got rid of my anxiety and calmed me down. Will definitely redo this \ud83d\ude4f",
    "My new favorite workout. For the first time, I felt my mind and body were in the same mindset as I stretched. I actually felt the burn following instructions given in the voiceover. It was so calming, and I think I achieved proper form (finally). Thanks so much! I&#39;m looking forward to more videos with a voiceover!"
