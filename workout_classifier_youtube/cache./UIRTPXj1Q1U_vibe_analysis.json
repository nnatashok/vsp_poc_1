  "vibesExplanation": "The workout primarily aligns with 'The Reboot Workout' vibe due to its focus on stretching and relieving tension caused by prolonged sitting, as noted in both the title ('Lower Body Stretch Routine') and description ('relieve pain/tension, and gain flexibility'). The session is described as 'quick' and involves a series of '5 active stretches,' suggesting a focus on gentle, restorative movement, typical of a reboot session. This is aligned with the vibe's emphasis on low-stress, total-body refresh.\n\nThe secondary vibe, 'The Foundation Builder,' is chosen because the workout addresses 'joint tension' and 'tight muscles,' focusing on improving flexibility and fundamental mobility ('gain flexibility over time,' 'lower body mobility exercises'). This focus on improving basic aspects of physical health and correcting issues from a sedentary lifestyle supports a Foundation Builder classification.\n\nThe confidence in these selections is high due to the explicit mention of the stretching and tension-relief intentions in the video metadata. No high-intensity, competitive, or performance-focused elements point towards exclusion of other vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Competitor.'"
