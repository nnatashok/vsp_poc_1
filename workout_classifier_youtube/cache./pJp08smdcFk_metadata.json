  "description": "Strengthen your core in just 6 minutes a day with this simple, effective home workout! 9 great exercises to strengthen your complete core including your abs, obliques, lower back, and hips. Led by a physical therapist to help you increase core strength, decrease pain, and help you look and feel your best.\n\n==============================\n\u27a1\ufe0f LINK TO JARED\u2019S THICK EXERCISE MAT: https://urlgeni.us/amzn/drjaredexercisemat\n==============================\n\n============================================\n\u2b50\ufe0f SUPPORT TONE AND TIGHTEN BY BECOMING A CHANNEL MEMBER! Different levels of support and perks are available - click here to learn more: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJASBOyF4Fkd26SIwRhLuZw/join\n============================================\n\nI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again\u2026 a large number of my patients would never need to come see me for their pains if they just took part in some regular core strengthening.\n\nThe problem is, most people don\u2019t know the right exercises they should be doing to increase strength in their core and most videos online are too long and too difficult.\n\nThose are the exact problems I wanted to help solve with this video!\n\nThis is a quick core workout that only takes 6 minutes to complete.\n\nYou\u2019ll complete 9 different exercises to strengthen all the major muscle groups in your core and hips and there is zero equipment required.\n\nI\u2019ll even personally guide you through the whole thing to ensure you\u2019re doing them correctly to get maximum benefit.\n\nHOW OFTEN SHOULD I TRAIN MY CORE?\nAs opposed to other muscle groups in your body, your core muscles are actually very resilient to training. That means they can handle more training more consistently than other areas.\n\nWhile other muscle groups typically need 48-72 hours to recover, most people can train their core every day and be just fine.\n\nDAILY CORE WORKOUT\nWe\u2019ll perform this workout in interval fashion - each exercise will be performed for 30 seconds with a 5-second \u201ctransition\u201d period to prepare for the next exercise.\nSo I\u2019m ready to get started when you are! Hope you enjoy this workout and hope it helps you to accomplish your goals. \n\nBRACE MARCHES\nREVERSE CRUNCHES\nHEEL TOUCHES\nSINGLE LEG BRIDGE R\nSINGLE LEG BRIDGE L\nSIDE PLANK L\nSIDE PLANK R\nSWIMMER\nLOW PLANK\nBIRD DOG\nBEAR HOLD\n\nHere is a 5 Minute Core Workout you can do everyday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcwh_79owDw\n\n\ud83d\udcac Did you complete this workout?

    "I am 53, I have arthritis in my feet, the inside of my knees are bone on bone and I have herniated disc&#39;s in my lower back. Not to mention a bit over weight. I have done construction my whole life and it has  been rough on my body. I started doing the core exercises after I came across one of your older videos. I have been doing them for about a week and already feel great improvement in my pain, range of motion and it is improving my posture. Thank you and I will definitely be checking out more of your videos, just what I needed.",
    "Thank you, sir! I\u2019m 20 years old and I suffer from a back pain since I don\u2019t sit properly. This video and your 8 minute stretching routine for beginers are a great way for me to finally start the change. Thank you."
