  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily embodies the 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit, indicated by terms like 'Fat Burning', 'spinning workout', and comments about the motivating nature of the scenery and speed ('keeps me moving faster'). These suggest a focus on effort and intensity, earning a score of 0.75.\n\n'Flow & Rhythm' is also relevant with a score of 0.65, as noted by comments stating the workout helps users forget they're cycling indoors, and the importance of music playlists, which aligns with smooth and continuous movement tied to music.\n\n'Outdoor & Adventure' receives a score of 0.5, influenced by the virtual scenic ride through the Dolomites, highlighted by the title and description. However, it remains virtual rather than an actual outdoor setting, thus it has a lower score.\n\nOther spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'Soothing & Restorative' do not fit, as the focus is less on structured progression or relaxation, and more on immersive, motivating virtual cycling."
