  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled 'Guided Breathing: Awaken Your Nervous System' on Kitaro Waga's channel is best classified with vibes 'The Deep Recharge' and 'The Zen Flow'. The focus on guided breathwork suggests a nervous system reset, fitting 'The Deep Recharge' vibe with a strong score of 0.8. This aligns with the directive not to perform this breathwork while in water or driving, indicating a calming and restorative nature. Comments such as \"makes for such a great start to my day\" and the emphasis on making users 'happy, healthy and strong' further support this calming and regeneration-centric experience.\n\nAdditionally, the use of the term 'guided breathing' and the instructor's background in meditation practices suggest a structured, mindful approach, aligning it with 'The Zen Flow'; hence, a score of 0.7 for its grounding and intentional qualities. Although not explicitly mentioned, the careful guidance implies breath-centered practice. Other potential vibes like 'The Mindful Walk' and 'The Reboot Workout' were considered but excluded due to lack of elements such as movement or physical activity in nature. The confidence level is high (0.85) given the specific content and feedback from viewers."
