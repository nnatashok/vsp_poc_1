  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit for this video is \"Structured & Disciplined,\" with a strong score of 0.8. This is based on the detailed focus on a \"Strength Circuit Workout\" as mentioned in the description, indicating a methodical approach to training. The systematic usage of tools like PowerBlock adjustable dumbbells and the structured programming common in strength training suggest a disciplined and precise workout style. The iterative mention of strength, circuit, and body focus in both the title and tags support this classification.\n\nA secondary spirit is \"High-Energy & Intense,\" with a moderate score of 0.6. While the primary emphasis is on structure, comments suggest an intense, full-body workout that \"kept my heart rate up the whole time,\" implying a vigorous and energetic session. Although intensity appears secondary to structure, participant feedback on heart rate and the nature of circuit training suggests a notable high-energy component.\n\nNo distinct indicators were present for spirits like \"Soothing & Restorative,\" \"Flow & Rhythm,\" or \"Outdoor & Adventure,\" as the focus is primarily on indoor, rigorous strength training with progressive disclosure of exercises."
