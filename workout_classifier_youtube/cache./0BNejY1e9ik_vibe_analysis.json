  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video, 'Wim Hof Method Guided Breathing for Beginners', embodies the vibe of 'The Deep Recharge' due to its nature as a breathing exercise designed to reset the nervous system. The gentle guidance, slow pace, and focus on respiratory control align with ultra-gentle movement, making it an ideal fit. Instructions to practice in a safe, seated or lying position enhance this classification, suggesting a session free of physical stress and targeted at deep relaxation (score 0.9).\n\nThe video also displays characteristics of 'The Zen Flow'. It involves grounding and breath-centered practices, focusing intentionally on maintaining rhythm and pace with audiovisual assists like the 'Breathing Bubble'. The slow, deliberate breathing routine emphasizes a calm and unhurried approach (score 0.6).\n\nBoth vibes are supported by user comments mentioning feelings of calm, emotional healing, and improved well-being, further reinforcing the workout's impact on mental and physical restoration. Other potential vibes, like active workouts, were excluded due to the low-intensity, inward focus of the session."
