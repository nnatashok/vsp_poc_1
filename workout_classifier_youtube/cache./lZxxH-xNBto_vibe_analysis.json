  "vibesExplanation": "The chosen vibes for this video align with the thematic elements and feedback from viewers. \"The Zen Flow\" is a strong match (0.9) as the video is described as a \"Vinyasa Yoga Flow,\" which suggests a grounding and intentional practice that is slow-paced yet fluid, supported by comments highlighting the calmness and minimalistic cues. \"The Reboot Workout\" is appropriate (0.7) since the description suggests this workout is a perfect quick pick-me-up for daily practice, providing a low stress, refreshing break as indicated by the description and duration of just 20 minutes. \"The Groove Session\" fits moderately (0.6) due to the expressive and fluid nature of the vinyasa flow, as suggested by comments about the peaceful experience and the playlist that accompanies the session. The comments affirm Jessica's minimalistic approach that aids immersion without distraction, supporting a calming vibe. Other potential vibes like \"The Meditative Grind\" were excluded due to the shorter duration and slightly higher pace typical of vinyasa flows."
