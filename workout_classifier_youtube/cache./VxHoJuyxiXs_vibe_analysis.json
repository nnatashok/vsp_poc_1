  "vibesExplanation": "The video is classified as 'The Deep Recharge' vibe primarily due to its focus on guided meditation, which is typically gentle and calming, aimed at nervous system reset and relaxation. This is supported by the video's description of raising your vibration and connecting with angelic figures, which suggests a spiritual, restful, and recharging experience. The high engagement and positive comments from users point towards a profound impact, with phrases like 'vibrating' and expressing gratitude for the meditation's calming effects.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Zen Flow' is also a suitable vibe due to the intentional and breath-centered nature inherent in guided meditations. The language used in the description and comments, such as 'confidence, hope, wisdom and love,' indicates a grounding and mindful experience.\n\nOther vibes like 'The Reboot Workout' were considered but dismissed due to the focus on spirituality and meditation rather than physical mobility or low-stress exercise. The very high views and likes further cement the confidence in this categorization, indicating a strong resonance and effectiveness in delivering relaxation and grounding."
