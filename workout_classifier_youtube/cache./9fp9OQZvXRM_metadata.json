    "Happy Sunday friends I hope you enjoy the self massage in this class, let me know how it goes?",
    "This is true yoga, not power yoga, not throwing yourself around on the mat to keep up with the instructor. Yoga is meditation, which I think it often lost with online videos. Charlie always emphasizes breathing throughout. I feel like a changed person when I come off the mat. Thank you, Charlie.",
    "I giggled when you faded away at the end. Thanks Charlie \ud83d\ude0a",
    "It seems you put a lot of thinking in these classes you\u2019ve for us.Thank you for such comforting yoga class. I\u2019m grateful for this\u2764",
