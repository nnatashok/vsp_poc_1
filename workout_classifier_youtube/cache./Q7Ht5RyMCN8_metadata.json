  "description": "We've got 40 minutes for a fat burning HIIT cardio workout, pyramid style! This cycling class has more than a few challenges to keep this ride fun and effective at helping you boost your metabolism and burn calories! \n\nThe pyramid structure we will follow will be based on RPM/speed and there will be 4 pyramid circuits in this workout. The pyramids will either be a fast, slow, fast structure or vice versa! Another big challenge I have for you is increasing your current resistance!! That means your current 7 will be your new 6, your current 8 will be your new 7, and so on! It is SO important to re-evaluate your resistance numbers because as you get stronger on the bike your resistance needs to increase too! This is to prevent a plateau and ensure that you continue to change and grow.\n\nI hope you enjoy this ride as much as I did! Thanks for working out with me! I also mentioned a few links during the ride, you can find those below!\n\nSign up for REVIVE here \ud83d\udc49  https://www.kaleighcohen.com/login-register/\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Join the Discord here!  \ud83d\udc49 https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kaleighcohen\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f SAVE 15% ON INDOOR CYCLING SHOES HERE!
