  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's duration of over 46 minutes, combined with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) structure and compound movements, contributes to a challenging to extreme effort level. The 45-second work and 15-second rest intervals significantly increase effort difficulty, especially when repeated three times per circuit, requiring sustained high energy expenditure.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Despite the strenuous duration and use of dumbbells, the description emphasizes that it's suitable for 'all fitness levels' and provides modifications for intensity. This inclusion suggests a welcoming approach for beginners, allowing for adjustments. However, the combination of the workout duration, intensity, and technique places it mostly in the intermediate and advanced range, demanding some fitness conditioning to complete effectively."
