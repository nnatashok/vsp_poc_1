    "1 tip im going to give to the begginers out there:<br>Do not,never think that you will be ashamed if someone sees you doing this or u feel cringy doing it,just dont if someone sees u(brother sister...) just ignore them its not worth it to stop making ur whole life better cuz someone laughed,its okay dw all people who were fat had to go through the same just let ur mind free and u will realize how enjoyable it is to workout.",
    "I did this for a year 3x a week! Results were incredible. I actually saw the outline of my abs for the first time. Such a fun easy workout.",
    "&quot;You&#39;re doing great!&quot;<br><br>me lying on the floor with my three toes destroyed after a dumbbell fell on my foot: \ud83d\udc4c",
    "This is extremely legit guys, I hav done this workout circuit for 2 months and can see my muscles developing so fast. Major health sites say that one should do 2-3 reps of a workout for 15-20 mins, and this provides it ..just blindly follow this and see the results, amazing!",
    "&quot;It&#39;s gonna be along fifteen minutes if you forget to breathe&quot;.   Can&#39;t argue with that."
