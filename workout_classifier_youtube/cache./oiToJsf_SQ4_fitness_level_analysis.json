  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout's effort difficulty can be classified as Moderately Challenging given its 31:50 minute duration. Pilates typically has a moderate level of energy expenditure as it focuses on controlled movements, but the longer duration indicates an increased level of physical effort, especially for users in poorer physical condition. Tags like 'pilates arm workout' and 'upper body pilates' imply sustained engagement of muscle groups, increasing effort. User comments frequently mention feeling benefits to posture and muscle engagement, indicating a moderately challenging effort level, suitable for deconditioned users to intermediate. The class is described as both a strengthening and stretching workout, which generally falls in the moderate range for effort.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is classified as Beginner to Advanced. This broad range is due to the nature of Pilates and the potential for modifications. Beginner users can follow along but might find the 31:50 minute duration slightly challenging, hence an Intermediate level is strongly represented. User comments about older adults and less active individuals engaging successfully argue for a Beginner rating. However, for sustained engagement and posture correction over the full duration, more experienced users might find additional benefits, explaining inclusion of Advanced. Nicole's known ability for clear instructions and modification options makes this relevant to a broad audience."
