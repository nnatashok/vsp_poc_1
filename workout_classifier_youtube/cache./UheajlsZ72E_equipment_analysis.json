  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled '10 Min Fat Burning Workout | No Equipment' clearly emphasizes that no equipment is required. This is reinforced by both the video title and description, which explicitly state the session can be conducted without any equipment. The tags such as 'No Gym No Problem!' and 'Get Ripped from Home - HIIT Workout (No Equipment Needed)' further indicate the bodyweight-only nature of the workout. Comments reflect the intensity of the exercises but make no mention of the need for equipment, supporting the inference that the workout relies on bodyweight exercises only. Thus, no equipment is needed for this workout."
