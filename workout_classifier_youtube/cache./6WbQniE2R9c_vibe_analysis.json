  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video \"Relaxing FULL BODY STRETCH // Flexibility & Mobility\" by Heather Robertson primarily embodies the vibe of 'The Reboot Workout' due to its focus on deep stretching, relaxation, and total-body refreshment. The title and description emphasize \"relaxing,\" \"unwind,\" and \"ease soreness,\" indicating a low-stress routine designed for recovery and refreshment, which aligns perfectly with a score of 0.9. Additionally, elements of 'The Zen Flow' are present, as the workout is described as \"working at your own pace,\" and emphasises listening to your body and doing what feels right, which is grounding and breath-centered, meriting a score of 0.8 for 'The Zen Flow'. The tags like \"recovery workout,\" \"stretch for relaxation,\" and \"improve flexibility\" further support these vibes. Other vibes such as 'The Comfort Moves' were considered but not selected, as the emphasis on relaxation and mobility fits better under 'The Reboot Workout' and 'The Zen Flow'. The confidence level is high (0.85) given the clear indicators in the metadata and consistent thematic focus on relaxation and recovery."
