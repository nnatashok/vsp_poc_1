  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout described in the video metadata primarily embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The emphasis on flexibility, mobility, and daily practice suggests a focus on healing and recovery, resonating with a restorative workout approach. The description and tags such as 'stretch for flexibility', 'quick daily stretch', and 'stretch for mobility' point to gentle movement aimed at stress reduction and improved well-being, which aligns strongly with this spirit, justifying a score of 0.9.\n\nAdditionally, there is an element of 'Flow & Rhythm', evidenced by the integration of these stretches into an everyday routine lasting 12 minutes. The structured progression and continuous nature of a stretch routine facilitate a mind-body connection, although this is less emphasized than the restorative aspects, thus receiving a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nPotential spirits like 'Structured & Disciplined' or 'High-Energy & Intense' are less applicable due to the absence of intensive, methodical training or fast-paced elements in the workout. The metadata lacks strong athletic or outdoor themes, ruling out 'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure'. The confidence level is high due to clear evidence from the video title, tags, and user comments."
