  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video titled '[BREATH BUFFET] Guided Alkaline DMT Breathing' is classified primarily as 'The Zen Flow' with a high score of 0.85. This classification is supported by the focus on breathwork as a practice to achieve calmness and altered states of consciousness, evident from terms like 'guided breathwork', 'holotropic breathwork', and 'DMT breathwork meditation' in the tags. These elements suggest an intentional, slow-paced, breath-centered experience that aligns with the Zen Flow vibe. The video also embodies 'The Deep Recharge' with a score of 0.75, as it emphasizes deep breathing exercises and potential for mental reset suggested by the description, emphasizing relaxation and stress relief. Lastly, 'The Mindful Walk' is assigned a score of 0.65 since the guided nature of the practice and its potential for meditative immersion resembles aspects of mindfulness walks. Other vibes such as 'The Reboot Workout' or 'The Sleep Prep' were considered but excluded due to the intense and complex breathwork involved, rather than simple relaxation or preparation for sleep."
