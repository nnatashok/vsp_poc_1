Each move is done for 40 seconds with a 20-second rest in between. Can be done at home, in your garden or park as you don\u2019t need any equipment at all. \nThe workout is split into 5 sections:\n* Section 1 (Warm-Up): We'll start with dynamic movements to get the blood flowing and muscles ready.\n* Section 2 (Upper Body): Focus on building strength in your arms, chest, and shoulders.\n* Section 3 (Lower Body): Hit the legs with exercises targeting the quads, hamstrings, and glutes.\n* Section 4 (Abs): Time to engage the core and work those abdominal muscles.\n* Section 5 (High Intensity): Finish strong with high-intensity moves to boost your heart rate and torch calories.\nNo equipment needed and no repeats, just 30 minutes of pure sweat! Enjoy!!!",

    "It was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIPvIYsjfpo&amp;t=1380\">23:00</a>, I agreed with myself I would do this workout today. I came up with many excuses. But I did it. I was tired, really out of shape, far from a perfect workout, but I did it. It absolutely destroyed me. Thanks duder \ud83d\udc4d",
    "I followed this workout routine for a month &amp; I see the results already. Working on improving my meal to reap more benefits. Will keep pushing myself to catch up with the speed while I maintain good form.",
    "Hi Rowan<br>It is one hell of a workout ....but please please release a version where you speak all the time like the 45 min version. I don&#39;t know the exercise names so I have to repeatedly look at the screen ajd I wear spectacles as well. So it would be a great help. Hope you read this suggestion. Love all xx.",
