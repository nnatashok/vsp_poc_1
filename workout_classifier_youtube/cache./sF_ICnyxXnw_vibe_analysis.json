  "vibesExplanation": "The dominant vibe for this workout video is 'The Warrior Workout' with a score of 0.75. This is supported by metadata indicating a 'brutal' workout experience (as mentioned in the comments), the focus on building strength, and the use of terms like 'full body' and 'intensity' (e.g., intermediate level calisthenics). Calisthenics typically demand significant strength and endurance, aligning well with the warrior-like, intense nature of this vibe.\n\n'Progression Quest' receives a score of 0.65 due to the structured nature of calisthenics training which aims for gradual improvement over time. Comments indicate users working through different workout levels and seeking long-term progress, which is a hallmark of a progression mindset.\n\n'The Disciplined Grind' is also a relevant vibe with a score of 0.6. The no-excuses, focused nature of calisthenics (often requiring consistent, disciplined practice) is highlighted by users' commitment to advancing their skills and the structured approach of the workout.\n\nThe repetition and technique-driven nature of calisthenics excludes vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Nightclub Workout', which are more about relaxed or rhythmic experiences. Despite the energetic music mentioned, the primary focus on structure and intensity informs the selected vibes."
