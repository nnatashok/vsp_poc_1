  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The analysis of the video metadata suggests that the workout appears to require no equipment beyond the use of a baby carrier for babywearing. The title, tags, and comments emphasize that this is a babywearing postpartum workout, which primarily involves carrying the baby throughout the exercises. There is no mention in the metadata of any specific fitness equipment like mats, dumbbells, or other typical workout items. Comments also focus on the practicality and necessity of keeping the baby close during the workout, which reinforces the idea that this is a bodyweight and babywearing-focused exercise routine. Therefore, no additional equipment is needed apart from a baby carrier, which is categorized under 'Other' if it were to be listed."
