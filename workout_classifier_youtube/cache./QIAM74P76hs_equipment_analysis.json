  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata explicitly identifies the need for an elliptical machine in the title, description, and tags. The title 'Elliptical Machine | Rolling Hills Low Impact Workout | Fitscope Studio' specifies that the workout is designed for use with an elliptical. The description reiterates this by calling it an 'elliptical machine interval workout,' simulating 'rolling hills' through resistance and inclines, which are features specific to elliptical machines. Tags also consistently mention 'elliptical,' corroborating its requirement. The confidence score is very high (1.0) because the elliptical is central to the workout, and the entire session is described around its use. Therefore, no other equipment is likely necessary, making this a focused elliptical workout."
