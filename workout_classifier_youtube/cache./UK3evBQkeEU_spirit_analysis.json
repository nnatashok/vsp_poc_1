  "spiritsExplanation": "The video 'Buteyko Breathing - Breathe Light, Slow & Deep | Guided Exercise for Anxiety & Brain Fog' is classified primarily under the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit (score: 0.95). This is due to the focus on calming exercises aimed at anxiety reduction and health improvement, emphasized by terms like 'breathe light,' 'slow,' and 'calming parasympathetic.' The method is described as healing and emphasizing recovery, supported by descriptions of diaphragmatic breathing and promotions of stress relief found in both the tags and the description. User comments also reflect calming effects, mentioning increased relaxation and reduced dizziness.\n\nSecondary classification under 'Flow & Rhythm' (score: 0.6) is due to the structured breathing pattern, the rhythm of breath (e.g., 'in for 5 seconds and out for 5 seconds'), and coordination of breath movement suggested by phrases like 'guidance with both my voice and bell sounds.' Although it lacks overt musical elements, the emphasis on rhythmical breathing patterns suggests a mild connection to this spirit.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are excluded because the video lacks elements of intensity and physical performance."
