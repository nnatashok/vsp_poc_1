  "channelDescription": "Hi, I'm Nicole! \ud83d\ude0a I am a Certified Pilates & Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) with many years of in-studio teaching experience. As a former dancer and gymnast, I have always had a passion for movement and I love being able to share that passion with others. I believe in finding forms of movement that feel good for your body and soul and I hope that through my classes, I can guide you to your best feeling self!\n\n--\nI was a professional Latin Ballroom Dancer and taught Ballroom dancing to adults for 7+ years. This is truly where I established my passion for teaching movement. When I retired from competitive dancing in 2017, I began teaching Barre and Pilates in studios and gyms in Sydney.\n\nDuring COVID lockdown, Dance & Pilates studios closed and that was when I poured my love of teaching into this channel, hoping to help people keep moving and feeling good!\n\nThank you so much for practicing with me and I hope you enjoy the classes as much as I love creating them for you. \ud83e\ude77\n",

    "Sometimes I think you\u2019re actually in the room with me because your prompts and form corrections are always exactly what I need in the moment!",
    "You&#39;re not a broken record, Nicole. I appreciate all those reminders. It&#39;s one of the many reasons I think you&#39;re the best Pilates and Yoga teacher.",
    "Today marks 365 days of moving with Nicole, and a new workout is out today! This is definitely a celebration for me!",
    "Love that you voiced this one!! Your explanation of simplistic things like trying not to pull too hard on your legs and the tightening jeans example really helped enhance this workout!",
    "im so impressed that you were speaking while doing all these exercises as if they were nothing!!! Queen!!!"
