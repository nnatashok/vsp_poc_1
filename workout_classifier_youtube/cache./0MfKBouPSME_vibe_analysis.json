  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Progression Quest' with a score of 0.8. The focus on traditional strength training with heavy weights and a structured format suggests a methodical and incremental approach to building muscle over time, which is characteristic of this vibe. The consistent use of terms like \"build muscle,\" \"heavy weights,\" and an emphasis on good form further supports this classification.\n\n'\"The Disciplined Grind' scored 0.7 as the workout involves a no-nonsense, focused approach characteristic of disciplined, strength-building efforts. The routine includes a systematic, traditional sequence of exercises repeated multiple times, emphasizing execution and form over quick results.\n\n'\"The Masterclass Workout' earns a 0.6 due to the emphasis on technique and form, mentioned explicitly in the description. Kaleigh's credentials and the structured guidance provided align with building technical proficiency, typical of a skill-building workout.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Warrior Workout' were considered but did not match well due to the lack of extreme intensity or primal energy often associated with bootcamps or HIIT sessions. Therefore, the confidence in this classification is high, rated at 0.9, given the detailed evidence in the metadata."
