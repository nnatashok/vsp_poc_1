  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video primarily embodies the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit due to its seated, no-impact format, making it suitable for individuals with injuries or limitations ('no impact', 'seated moves that work your whole body'). The title's emphasis on 'seated' and 'no impact' corresponds to a gentle and accessible workout structure, supported by comments from users with injuries (e.g., 'knee injury and inability to walk outside'). This aligns with a restorative approach, scoring 0.75 due to its strong restorative elements. Additionally, the workout has elements of 'Structured & Disciplined' due to the use of dumbbells and a set duration of 30 minutes, indicative of a structured routine, and the channel's focus on discipline and precise methods in workouts. The term 'INTENSE!' suggests a level of challenge within the structured format, supporting a score of 0.65. The absence of an outdoor environment or sports-specific skills excludes 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Sport & Agility' spirits."
