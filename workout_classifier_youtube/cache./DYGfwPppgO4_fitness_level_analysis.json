  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The movements described in the metadata suggest a routine focused on light and easy stretches, suitable for general stress relief and flexibility. The terms 'light stretch' and 'calming stretch' imply basic movements typical of a beginner-level routine. The ease of execution is likely high, with minimal coordination required, pushing the technique difficulty firmly into the Beginner category. However, some slight overlap with Intermediate could be considered, as stretching techniques may require some body awareness.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is described as a calming, stress-relief routine with minimal talking, indicating a low-intensity experience. The tags and description heavily emphasize relaxation, ruling out intense energy expenditure. The 18-minute duration and focus on flexibility are consistent with low-effort activity, aligning closely with the Light category. However, a small portion of Moderate scoring is included, recognizing that sustained stretching can pose a slight challenge for an entirely deconditioned individual.",
