  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled '15 Min. Full Body Stretch | Daily Routine for Flexibility, Mobility & Relaxation | DAY 7,' which clearly suggests a stretching routine. The tags include 'noequipment,' 'yoga,' and 'beginner,' reinforcing the idea that no equipment is necessary. The description mentions this as a 'Full Body Stretching Routine,' and there is an explicit emphasis on it being done without a voice-over to focus on personal practice and reflection. Therefore, based on the metadata, this video is a bodyweight-only stretching session, requiring no additional equipment."
