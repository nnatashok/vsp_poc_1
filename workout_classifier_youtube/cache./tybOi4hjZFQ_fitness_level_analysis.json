  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The technique difficulty is rated mainly as 'Beginner' because the video focuses on guided breathing exercises, which are simple and straightforward actions requiring minimal coordination. The user needs to follow the rhythm of breathing as instructed, which is basic and controlled through visual and auditory cues. Given the instruction to increase gradually to avoid symptoms like tinnitus, a secondary classification of 'Intermediate' is justifiable for practitioners who might want to explore deeper breaths or advanced breathing techniques over time.",

  "effortDifficultyConfidence": 0.9,
  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The effort difficulty is categorized as 'Light' because the guided breathing exercise involves low physical exertion with no cardiovascular or muscular demand. Being a 11-minute session primarily focusing on controlled breathing, the activity requires minimal energy expenditure. The task of maintaining focus on breathing without external distractions adds a mental effort component, but physically, it remains light.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelConfidence": 0.85,
  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level is primarily 'Beginner' since the technique is relatively simple and the effort required is light, making it suitable for nearly everyone, including those new to exercise or with low fitness levels. However, an 'Intermediate' classification is included to cover those who might engage more vigorously with the technique, especially those applying it to challenging personal contexts, such as overcoming stress or addiction, as suggested by user comments. This diversity in application highlights that while the exercise is accessible to beginners, more experienced practitioners can derive greater benefit."
