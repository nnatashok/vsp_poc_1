    "Hi I\u2019m 16 and 330 lb. In the Past two weeks I when from 343 to 331 just by eating less and walking a bit more. Now I\u2019m 329 and my weight won\u2019t seem to go down so I\u2019m adding in cardio and hoping for the best. I could only do about 10-15 mins of this workout and burned almost 200 cals it was so good. I was crying because I was embarrassed that I\u2019m 16 and this is the best I can do. But I know if I stick to it I could do some of your other workouts! For some reason I don\u2019t sweat a lot even though my heart rate was at 130. Tips for my weightloss journey to 130lbs would be greatly appreciated. So many people tell me I can\u2019t do it and that I need surgery, but I\u2019m going to prove them wrong 200lb later! Thank you so much you motivate me \ud83d\ude0a<br><br>Edit: I\u2019m now 315lb (I almost gave up in May and gained some weight but then I changed myself and lost it plus more.)<br><br>Edit: I\u2019m 299lbs. Since end of April I lost like 41lbs haha!<br><br>Edit 2: I\u2019m 293 now I just want to thank everyone who has been so kind. 50lb down!<br><br>Edit 3: 288!\u263a\ufe0f and I turned 17 yay!",
    "i am 21. i have been basically sedentary for 3 years due to mental illness. so much so that my joints and back hurt similarly to my 75 y/o grandmother. this is my first step to taking back my life and honestly i was crying throughout due to how positive and uplifting this video was and made me feel. i honestly have hope for the first time in a long time.",
    "This wasn&#39;t just a chair workout, this was therapy.",
