  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category of 'Meditation' has been selected with a score of 1.0 due to the explicit mention in the title and throughout the description of 'guided meditation' for healing anxiety, PTSD, panic, and stress. This is reinforced by channel information and tags that focus heavily on meditation, relaxation, and guided visualization, as well as user comments reflecting meditation's calming effects. Additionally, 'Breathing exercises' is assigned a score of 0.7 since the description specifies the inclusion of 'diaphragmatic breathing (or belly breathing)', which is a common breathing technique in meditation and relaxation practices. The video\u2019s focus on relaxation and mental well-being further supports these categories. No evidence suggests other exercise categories apply."
