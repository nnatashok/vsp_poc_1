  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Pilates' with a score of 0.8. This is supported by explicit mentions in the title, tags, and description, such as '8 Minute Good Morning Pilates Stretch,' 'morning pilates workout,' and 'Chloe, from Go Chlo Pilates.' The video emphasizes a Pilates routine, and the repeated use of 'pilates' in tags reaffirms this. Furthermore, the description states, 'Join Chloe, for this stretch routine,' indicating a focus on stretching. Therefore, 'Stretching' is also selected as a category with a score of 0.6, since the workout combines elements of both Pilates and stretching to enhance flexibility, as per user comments noting benefits like feeling relaxed and reduced tightness. The channel 'Well+Good' and trainer 'Chloe de Winter' also contribute to the credibility of the workout focus being Pilates-based."
