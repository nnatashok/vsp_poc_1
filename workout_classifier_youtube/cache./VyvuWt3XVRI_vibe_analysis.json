  "vibesExplanation": "The vibe classification for Lilly Sabri's 'PILATES ABS in 14 DAYS' workout video centers on the methodology and intent to teach technique and form, typical of \"The Masterclass Workout\". The description emphasizes \"deep core activation\" and technique-centric language like \"ab exercises to help you sculpt\", aligning with this vibe. The score of 0.75 indicates clear elements of skill-building and technique guidance, reinforced by the channel's emphasis on Pilates and physiotherapy.\n\nAdditionally, there is a strong \"Progression Quest\" aspect, as the workout is set up as a 14-day challenge with a goal (ab definition and strength), inviting users to track their progress and commit to a routine for improvement. User comments reflect that individuals are seeing tangible progress over the challenge period, supporting a 0.7 score for this vibe.\n\nFinally, \"The Foundation Builder\" vibe is present due to the core-focused, foundational exercise regime aimed at strengthening specific muscle groups (core), which is at the heart of Pilates practice. This vibe is scored at 0.6 because the workout emphasizes building core stability and strength, key to foundational fitness exercises."
