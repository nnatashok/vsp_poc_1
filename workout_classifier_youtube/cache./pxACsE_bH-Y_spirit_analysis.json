  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout primarily aligns with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as it is focused on preparing the body for childbirth in a gentle, supportive way. The use of a birth ball suggests a soft approach to enhance comfort and ease, which is restorative. The title and description emphasize 'easy delivery,' 'positive birth,' and 'daily exercises,' reinforcing the gentle and supportive nature with a high confidence of 0.85.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is also relevant, as birth ball exercises likely involve smooth continuous movements aimed at improving flexibility and relaxation, crucial during pregnancy. The reference to pregnancy yoga in the description and tags supports this association, leading to a score of 0.65.\n\nA moderate presence of 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is noted as the exercises are done daily with specific goals in mind, following a methodical approach for preparation. User comments about consistent practice before labor highlight the structure of the routine, warranting a score of 0.45.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are excluded due to the lack of intense or athleticism-focused indicators in the metadata."
