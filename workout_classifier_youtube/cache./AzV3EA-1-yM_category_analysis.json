  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is best classified as a 'Body weight' workout because it primarily involves strength training exercises using body weight, as suggested by phrases like 'beginner's full body workout routine' and 'no equipment full body workout' in the tags. The title and description emphasize a workout that can be done at home without a gym, aligning with body weight exercises. This category receives a score of 0.7 due to the clear emphasis on such exercises.\n\nThe video is also a 'Weight workout' since Circuit 3 specifically involves 'dumbbells' or 'filled water bottles' for resistance exercises focused on arms, shoulders, biceps, and back. The use of weights, as noted in the detailed description of Circuit 3, justifies this categorization with a score of 0.7.\n\nThe 'Mat' category is relevant due to the mention of a 'Full Body Stretch and Warm up' in Circuit 1 and exercises that likely involve floor work (indicative of exercise mat usage), though it is not a strong focus, thereby scored at 0.4.\n\nOverall, the data suggests a hybrid workout involving body weight and some weighted exercises, reflected in the moderate to high confidence scores for the respective categories due to the structured nature of the workout and the clear intention expressed in the metadata."
