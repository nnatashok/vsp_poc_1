  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video explicitly focuses on 'Treadmill Running Form For Beginners,' as stated in both the title and tags such as 'Treadmill Running,' 'Treadmill Running Form,' and 'Treadmill For Beginners.' The description talks about learning how to run indoors and getting off a treadmill safely, which directly implies the need for a treadmill. Comments also discuss experiences and concerns related to using a treadmill, further confirming its central role in the workout. Therefore, I have assigned 'Treadmill' a very high confidence score of 1.0, as it is explicitly required and central to the workout."
