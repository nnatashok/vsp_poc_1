  "title": "CALISTHENICS GLUTES & HAMSTRINGS WORKOUT - Bodyweight Only | Day Three",
  "description": "Bodyweight glutes & hamstrings! Sounds easy option? This workout is not! If you are able to really connect with the glute muscles in the correct movement pattern, full range of movement, perform control on lowering portion, and alignment of feet and hips, you will feel your glutes working through this workout full of unilateral work, hip thrusts and sumos! The hamstrings will be individually targeted too\u2026 prepare for an intense session!!! \n\nThe timer will be on for 45 seconds each set with no rest between 4 sets to make each giant set! We will have 20 seconds rest between each giant set!\n\nEach giant set will be performed for 2 sets however most of the giant sets involve all on one side then the next giant set bring the opposite side!\n\nFor this glute & hamstring workout, you will simply need your mat and a chair/bench for single leg hip thrusts! \n\nAnkle weights can be added at the beginning if you prefer! \n\nX OVER\nPULSE!\nDIAGONAL LIFT\nDIAGONAL PULSE!\n\nDONKEY LIFT\nHOLD!\nDONKEY X OVER\nPULSE!\n\nHAMSTRING LIFT\nHOLD!\nREVERSE PLANK LIFT\nHOLD!\n\nX1 LEG HIP THRUST\nPULSE!\nHOLD!\nHAMSTRING LIFT (same leg)\n\nFEET TOGETHER GLUTE SQUEEZE\nLEGS EXTEND LIFT\nPULSES!\nOPEN & CLOSE!\n\nSUMO 1 1/2 REPS\n1/2 REPS!\nRDL TO SUMO (stand inbetween)\nRDL TO SUMO (no standing inbetween)\n\nDeceivingly challenging! This workout will really help improve the connection you have with isolating the glute muscles and working through your full range. Also use this time to play with positions\u2026 draw attention to hips back during sumos and squeezing the glutes maximally at the top of the movement during hip thrusts.\n\nThe most challenging for me was the hamstring lifts!!!\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 Interesting to see what you think is the most intense and demanding! \n\nTry to really keep focussed, this workout involves that mind to muscle connection!\n\nSmash it!! \n\nCx\n\nMy Glute Activation Workout: https://youtu.be/NPVIiAvi1hM\n\nAlways ensure you warm up before any workout.
