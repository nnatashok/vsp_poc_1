  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is specifically centered on using a stationary bike, as indicated in the title, tags, and description. The title \"Stationary Bike Workout for Beginners | 20 Minute\" and tags such as \"stationary bike, exercise bike workout, indoor cycling\" strongly indicate that an exercise bike is essential. The description further confirms this by directly addressing viewers who have recently acquired a stationary or exercise bike, and encourages them to participate in the workout by \"getting on your bike and let's get these pedals spinning!\" This specificity contributes to a very high confidence score (0.9) that an exercise bike is required. There is no indication of any additional equipment being needed for this workout."
