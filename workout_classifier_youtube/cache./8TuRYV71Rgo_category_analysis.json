  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Yoga,' with a high confidence level (0.9). The title, description, and tags all emphasize yoga, specifically targeting stress and anxiety relief. The consistent use of the term 'yoga' in the title, tags like '10 minute yoga,' and phrases within the description such as 'gentle 10 minute yoga' provide clear evidence of this being a yoga-focused session. Additionally, the channel itself, Yoga With Bird, is dedicated to yoga practices, further supporting this categorization. \n\nThe secondary category is 'Stretching,' assigned a moderate score of 0.5. The description mentions focusing on stretches targeting the hips and lower back, indicating a component of flexibility training. The reference to 'creating the space needed for optimal oxygen intake' suggests an element of stretching that aims at physical relaxation. \n\n'Meditation' receives a lower score (0.3) due to the video\u2019s emphasis on mental tranquility and emotional relief, reinforced by user comments expressing feelings of calm and gratitude post-exercise. The meditative aspect is an undercurrent, thus justifying a lower score compared to yoga and stretching."
