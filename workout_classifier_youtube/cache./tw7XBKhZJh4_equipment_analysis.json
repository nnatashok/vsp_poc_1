  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a mindfulness meditation led by Sam Harris, focused solely on meditation practice without any physical exercise involved. The metadata, including the title, description, and tags, clearly categorize it as a meditation video rather than a physical workout. Additionally, user comments highlight the nature of the content as a guided meditation experience without mentioning any physical exercises or equipment. Therefore, it is evident that this video does not require any physical equipment and is primarily intended for mental focus and relaxation. Consequently, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, requiring no equipment."
