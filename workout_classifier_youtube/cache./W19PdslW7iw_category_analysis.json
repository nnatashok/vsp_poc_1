  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Meditation' with a very high confidence score of 1.0. This is based on explicit indicators in the metadata. The title \"15 Minute Guided Meditation To Find Peace In Uncertain Times\" and numerous tags such as 'guided meditation', 'meditation for anxiety', and 'meditation for stress' suggest a central focus on meditation. The description further emphasizes meditation as a tool for stress relief and inner peace, fitting the 'Meditation' category completely.\n\nThe secondary category 'Breathing exercises' receives a score of 0.6. This is inferred from the associated practices often included in guided meditations and sessions aimed at stress reduction, although not explicitly mentioned, it can be reasonably expected that controlled breathing is part of the meditation session. \n\nThe 'Yoga' category could have been considered but was excluded because the content is clearly oriented towards meditation rather than physical postures associated with yoga, as indicated by the description and the focus of the session. Overall, the classifications are supported by the content's strong alignment with meditative practices."
