    "Joe thank you! I have been trying to find motivation for months to get back in shape.  But this is the first workout I\u2019ve actually enjoyed that also has felt like it\u2019s actually doing something! Now I\u2019ve finally worked out two days in a row, and I\u2019m looking forward to doing it again tomorrow. Thank you!",
