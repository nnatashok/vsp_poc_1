  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout is categorized primarily as 'Mat' because the description and tags highlight exercises that are done on the floor or in positions where the baby can be carried without additional equipment. The video focuses on a low-impact postpartum routine, often associated with mat exercises, as it caters to women who have recently given birth and may include gentle movements performed on a mat. This is supported by tags like 'postpartum workout,' 'postnatal workout,' and 'exercise with baby,' which do not mention any equipment other than the baby itself.\n\nAdditionally, 'Body weight' fits the video's theme as it involves carrying the baby during the workout, using the baby's weight for resistance. Tags like 'babywearing workout' and 'mom and baby workout' imply that the workout leverages body weight for exercise.\n\nWhile Pilates could be a potential category due to the channel's focus on such exercises ('Postnatal Pilates and Core Healing' video in the description), the specific emphasis on babywearing and postpartum considerations makes 'Mat' and 'Body weight' more suitable. The confidence level is moderately high given explicit metadata indicators and the channel's specialized focus on postpartum fitness."
