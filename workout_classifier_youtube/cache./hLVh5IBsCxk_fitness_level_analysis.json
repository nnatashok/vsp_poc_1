  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout consists of a variety of bodyweight exercises including burpees, lunges, high knees, and push-ups, which require moderate coordination and balance, consistent with intermediate level. Exercises like bear walk outs, lunge jumps, and walking push-ups add complexity, suggesting some advanced elements. The use of multiple movement patterns and stability requirements further supports a mix of intermediate and advanced levels.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This HIIT routine is 20 minutes long with 30-second work periods and 10-second rest intervals, which indicates a moderate to challenging energy expenditure. The pace and inclusion of high-intensity moves like burpees suggest significant effort is required, especially for less fit individuals. The continuous sequence and short recovery push effort into more challenging terrain, although users can modify intensity which aligns more closely with moderate expectations.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The combination of intermediate to advanced technique difficulty and moderate to challenging effort difficulty suggests that this workout is suitable for intermediate levels and up. While modifications are encouraged, the overall intensity and complexity make it more appropriate for those who have some exercise experience. The workout's duration (over 20 minutes) also contributes to a reduced suitability for absolute beginners, strengthening its alignment with intermediate and advanced users."
