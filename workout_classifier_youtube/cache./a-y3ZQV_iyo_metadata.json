    "I am 76 and have been using utube for the last 2 months to do chair aerobics and chair yoga.  I have always been an advocate for exercise but my arthritis and sciatica have limited my routines. I always use my big screen TV because it is like you are in the room with me, but I can&#39;t  like or comment so I decided to take time and go on my laptop and comment on some of my most liked workouts.  I happened upon yours about a month ago and when I need a power workout your my gal!!!!!<br>I especially enjoy the cardio and strength workout with dumbbells!!!!!  Your  energy and positive attitude keep me going even when I might be getting tired.  Thanks, Caroline and keep up the great work",
    "This workout is NO JOKE, thank you Caroline! With my knee injury and inability to walk outside, these chair routines are a God&#39;s send!",
    "I recently fractured my ankle and was desperately looking for a workout to get me through the next month or so.  I first found your Pilates with a foot injury and LOVED IT.  Then found your chair cardio.  I. Am. So. Happy.  You are incredible.  I love your energy, you make me smile the entire time I am working out, your form reminders are perfect timing and all your encouragement means the world to me.  Thank you.",
    "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-y3ZQV_iyo&amp;t=995\">16:35</a> &quot;Make sure those dumbbells are not by your feet.&quot; The reason I am here. Had a foot problem, started practicing walking barefoot, added dumbbells to my routine. Yep, I slammed my toe into the dumbbells one day. New foot problem. Not giving up my exercise, so glad you are here!"
