  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Weight workout' with a high confidence score of 0.9. The title and tags explicitly mention 'dumbbell workout', 'strength workout', and 'dumbbell strength training', which are clear indicators of using weights as the central component of the workout. The description further emphasizes the use of 'dumbbells to challenge you with each exercise', reinforcing the focus on weight training using free weights. This strong presence of weight-related terms justifies the score assigned.\n\nThe secondary category, 'Body weight', is included with a low score of 0.3 due to the mention of 'All Standing' and 'no lunges', suggesting an inclusion of exercises possibly leveraging body weight mechanics, albeit as a minor component compared to the central dumbbell focus. The description also highlights the workout's accessibility for 'most fitness levels', typically characteristic of body weight workouts."
