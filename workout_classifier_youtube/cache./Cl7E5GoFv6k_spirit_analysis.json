  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video is primarily classified as \"Structured & Disciplined\" because it follows a clear, methodical approach with set exercises and repetitions designed for beginners and seniors. This is evidenced by the description mentioning two sets of eight exercises, each with 10 reps, a warm-up, and a cooldown phase, which indicates a structured routine aimed at learning fundamental movements. \n\nThe secondary classification is \"Soothing & Restorative\" with high confidence due to its focus on seniors and beginners, highlighting gentle muscle building and the option to use light weights or no weights at all. The concern for injury prevention and joint sensitivity, as seen in the comments and the channel's focus on fitness for older adults, aligns with a restorative and considerate approach.\n\nOther spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" and \"Outdoor & Adventure\" are excluded due to the lack of fast-paced, outdoor, or extreme elements, confirming the workout's calm, structured nature. The evidence from the video metadata strongly supports these two spirits."
