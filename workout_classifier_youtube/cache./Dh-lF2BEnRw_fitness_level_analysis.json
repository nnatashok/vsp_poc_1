  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is designed to be performed on a couch, featuring simple movements accessible to those with minimal physical activity. The use of terms like 'lazy girl,' 'gentle workout,' and 'low impact' in the title and tags suggests minimal complexity in technique. Additionally, user comments indicate that the workout is approachable for users who are significantly deconditioned, supporting a high confidence in a Beginner rating for Technique Difficulty.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The 12:39 duration and the classification as a 'lazy girl workout' on a couch imply a very low intensity and effort required. The description highlights it as a 'gentle, lazy girl workout,' 'low impact,' and suitable to do while watching TV, indicating minimal physical demand. User feedback highlights motivation and the workout being a good entry point for inactive individuals, confirming low physical exertion.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the Beginner rating for both technique and effort difficulties, the workout is clearly suitable for Beginner fitness levels, as evidenced by the language in the description and user comments about its accessibility to those very out of shape. However, due to the motivational aspect and potential for very light activity among slightly more active participants, there's a minor justification to include Intermediate as an applicable fitness level, given users may wish to engage in low-effort recovery activities."
