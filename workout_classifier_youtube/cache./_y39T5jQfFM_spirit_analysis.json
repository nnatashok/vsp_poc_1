  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video '25 MIN FEEL GOOD PILATES' from Move With Nicole has been classified into three spirits based on the following evidence:\n\n1. **Soothing & Restorative (0.8):** The title and description emphasize this as a 'Feel Good' and 'Gentle' class, which aligns closely with a restorative spirit. The comments also indicate the session is perfect for low energy days and enhances mood, further supporting its restorative nature. This is a strong match due to explicit language about feeling good and gentle movements.\n\n2. **Flow & Rhythm (0.7):** The workout is described as a Pilates class, which inherently involves a rhythm and flow of movements. The user's experience described in the comments\u2014such as feeling balanced and experiencing mental and physical benefits\u2014suggests a meditative flow is present. Additionally, Nicole's background in dance likely influences her teaching style, adding to the rhythmic quality.\n\n3. **Structured & Disciplined (0.5):** Pilates is a methodical form of exercise, often following precise movements and techniques, indicative of a structured spirit. The moderate score reflects the nature of Pilates as a progression-based discipline, even in a more feel-good, gentle form.\n\nOverall, the focus on gentle, feel-good elements and the benefits of the workout support a restorative classification as primary, with elements of flow and structure accompanying."
