  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout description explicitly mentions the use of weights during the 25 minutes of strength training, specifically indicating the use of 5 lb weights, with options for beginners to use 1, 2, or 3 lb weights. This aligns with the usage of dumbbells for strength exercises. The consistent reference to weights across both the description and intended strength training segments supports a high confidence score of 0.8 that dumbbells are required for the workout. No other equipment is outlined or implied in the metadata, making dumbbells the central piece of equipment needed to perform the workout effectively."
