  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"13 min Breathwork & Meditation Practice | Pranayama Techniques | Stress & Anxiety Relief\" focuses on breathing exercises and meditation, which typically do not require any specialized equipment. The description suggests using a block or pillow for support while seated, but this is optional as indicated by the phrase \"Feel free to do this session seated on a block or pillow or lying down.\" This implies that participants can simply sit or lie down comfortably without any equipment. The tags and comments also emphasize the meditative and breathing aspects of the practice without mention of equipment. Therefore, this video seems oriented around bodyweight practices and does not mandate any specific equipment."
