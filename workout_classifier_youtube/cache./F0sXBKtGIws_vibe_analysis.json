  "vibesExplanation": "The video \"5 min Yoga Break: Reset & Find Calm\" primarily embodies \"The Zen Flow\" vibe (score: 0.9) due to its grounding and breath-centered approach. The title and description emphasize using deep belly breathing, which is a core aspect of Zen-focused practices. The inclusion of stretches and a relaxing twist aligns with the slow and intentional movement characteristic of Zen Flow. \n\nThe \"Reboot Workout\" vibe (score: 0.8) is also prominent due to the video's focus on stress relief and tension release, aiming for a total-body refresh in a short time. Tags like \"yoga for stress relief\" and comments about feeling calmer after the session reinforce the notion of a quick restorative break.\n\nLastly, aspects of \"The Deep Recharge\" (score: 0.7) are present as the session includes relaxation techniques and breathwork tailored to reduce anxiety and stress, indicative of a gentle nervous system reset. While there is overlap with other vibes, the focus on calm and relaxation provides a strong case for this classification. The lack of intense or competitive elements led to excluding vibes like The Warrior Workout or The Competitor."
