  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative,' with a high confidence score of 0.95. This classification is supported by the video's focus on diaphragmatic breathing and meditation, which are inherently linked to relaxation and stress reduction, as indicated by terms like \"meditation for relaxation\" and \"breathing meditation\" in the tags. The description emphasizes mindfulness and awareness of breathing, suggesting a healing and restorative practice.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit also has some relevance with a moderate score of 0.45. While the session is not movement-based, the practice of continuous and mindful breathing exhibits flow and a rhythmic pattern. Comments note the guidance through breath and the calming delivery, which aligns with the mind-body connection aspect of this spirit.\n\nOther spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are not applicable as the workout lacks intensity, structured protocols, sports-specificity, or environmental exploration."
