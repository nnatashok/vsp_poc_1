  "spiritsExplanation": "The 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is the primary classification for this video. The title explicitly mentions 'Calm Breathing Exercise' and 'Relax or Fall Asleep Fast,' indicating a focus on relaxation and stress reduction. The description reinforces this by discussing calming the sympathetic nervous system and promoting relaxation, which are key elements of restorative practices. User comments also emphasize relaxation and stress relief benefits. Thus, the score of 0.95 reflects a very strong match.\n\nThe 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit is included due to the presence of rhythmic music and the smooth, continuous nature of guided breathwork, noted in the description. The creator's emphasis on music-driven practices and the importance of a rhythmic guide in the relaxation process contribute to a moderate connection to this spirit, justifying a score of 0.5. Other potential spirits, like 'High-Energy & Intense,' are excluded due to the video's focus on relaxation rather than intense physical exertion."
