  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video focuses on introductory exercises for calisthenics, aiming to establish a strong foundation ('The Foundation Builder'). The title emphasizes 'beginner workout routine' and the description highlights 'the basics of calisthenics' and 'building a strong calisthenics foundation', which strongly aligns with this vibe, justifying the high score of 0.9 for this vibe.\n\nThe inclusion of a structured routine ('beginner workout plan') and the focus on skill building ('learn calisthenics skills') support the 'Progression Quest' vibe, as it involves a step-by-step approach to long-term improvement. This vibe is given a score of 0.7 as the workout plan indicates incremental progress, although the primary emphasis is foundational.\n\nThe emphasis on 'learning calisthenics skills' and 'technique' suggests elements of 'The Masterclass Workout', which is more focused on skill and technique. However, this is secondary to the foundational and progression aspects, hence assigned a moderate score of 0.5.\n\nOther potential vibes such as 'The Warrior Workout' or 'The Disciplined Grind' are excluded due to the beginner-friendly, instructional nature of the content, rather than intense or disciplined efforts."
