  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of this workout video is 'The Deep Recharge,' evident from the emphasis on 'guided deep breathing' and 'reduce stress' both in the title and the description. This suggests a focus on relaxation and nervous system restoration. The video duration of 14:38 indicates a session long enough for a substantial relaxation experience without overloading. Viewer comments further emphasize the transformative and restorative impact, with phrases like 'saving my life every day' and 'a better life,' pointing to a profound, gentle reset (",
  " reduce stress & be happy). This vibe scores 0.85 as it aligns closely with the general purpose and approach described.\n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Zen Flow,' supported by the breath-centered nature of the workout, also reflected in the tags indicating a methodical breathing practice. Mention of 'wim hof breathing' points to a structured but relaxed focus on breathing, aligning with meditative and calm qualities. This vibe scores 0.7 due to the significant breath-centered, intentional relaxation and presence focus, although not as strongly as 'The Deep Recharge'.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Mindful Walk' or 'The Reboot Workout' are less fitting as neither the title nor the description indicates a focus on movement or physical exercises, thus they are excluded.": ""
