  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'You Are Life Itself \u2014 Guided Meditation with Mooji' is a guided meditation, as indicated by the title and description. Guided meditation typically involves listening, contemplation, and possibly a relaxed seated or lying position, but it does not explicitly require any workout equipment. The tags, such as 'meditation,' 'self-realization,' 'awakening,' and 'spirituality,' further emphasize the focus on introspection and mindfulness, rather than physical exercise. Since there are no direct or implied mentions of physical workout equipment or exercises, we can conclude that this video does not require any equipment, aligning with the nature of a meditation video focused on mental and spiritual practices."
