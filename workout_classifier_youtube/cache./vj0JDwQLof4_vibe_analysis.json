  "vibesExplanation": "The video is labeled as a '10-Minute Guided Meditation: Self-Love' featuring Manoj Dias, which directly indicates a focus on mental relaxation and emotional well-being. The title and description suggest a calming, introspective practice designed for self-care, aligning with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe (score: 0.9) due to its emphasis on nervous system reset and gentle movement. \n\nThe mention of 'mindfulness meditation,' 'self-love,' and the serene and introspective nature of the comments reflect elements of 'The Zen Flow' (score: 0.7), as it suggests a grounding and breath-centered approach. \n\nComments highlight emotional release and comfort ('I started crying... \"May I feel safe\"'), supporting 'The Comfort Moves' (score: 0.5) score, which includes safe, feel-good movement, although this is a weaker fit given the primarily meditative focus. \n\nThe channel's emphasis on holistic well-being further supports these vibes. Vibes unrelated to physical exertion or intense workout energy are not applicable here. The high number of views and likes indicates a well-received, impactful content contributing to the confidence of this classification."
