  "vibesExplanation": "The '10 min STANDING ARM WORKOUT' offers a methodical and technique-focused experience with consistent pacing and a focus on form, evident from its emphasis on being an 'arm workout with dumbbells' and 'zero pushups' design, suiting 'The Masterclass Workout' vibe with a score of 0.7. The instructor's qualifications in kinesiology and personal training bolster this classification. \"The Foundation Builder\" vibe is applicable due to the workout's design to 'sculpt and strengthen' without intense pressure, clear from the 'wrist-friendly,' 'no pushups,' and 'no planks' tags, suggesting a foundational approach for strength building, warranting a score of 0.5. Lastly, 'The Comfort Moves' vibe is slightly relevant ('score: 0.4') as the workout is accessible, suitable for various ages and fitness levels, and presented in a supportive, gentle tone according to user comments. The video does not fit high-intensity or complex performance vibes, excluding options geared toward extreme physical challenges."
