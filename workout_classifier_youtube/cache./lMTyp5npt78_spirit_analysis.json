  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout video 'Upper Back Love | Yoga For Back Pain' is primarily characterized by a 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit, as evidenced by its focus on relieving tension and promoting relaxation. The description highlights intentions such as stretching, relieving tension, and counteracting the effects of daily stress. Tags like 'yoga for back pain' and 'healing yoga' further emphasize a therapeutic and restorative aim. The spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm' is also present to some extent, as yoga typically involves continuous, smooth movement patterns and coordination, supported by phrases like 'activate, stretch, and relieve' from the description. Meanwhile, there are no indicators of high energy, intense exercises, structured training, sports agility, or outdoor environments, thus excluding those spirits from the analysis. Given the metadata, the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is clearly dominant, while 'Flow & Rhythm' play a secondary role."
