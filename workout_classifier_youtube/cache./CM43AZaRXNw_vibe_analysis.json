  "vibesExplanation": "The primary workout vibe classified for this video is 'The Zen Flow' due to the emphasis on intentional, unhurried movement, and breath-centered yoga practice. This is evidenced by the video's focus on a morning routine that builds strength and energy while incorporating flexibility poses, all indicative of a grounding and intentional style (confidence: 0.8). \n\nAdditionally, a 'Groove Session' vibe is moderately present due to the flow of the Vinyasa yoga described as a 'yoga flow' and 'full body stretch', which implies a more expressive, fluid movement experience (confidence: 0.5). \n\nThere is a slight 'Endorphin Wave' vibe as the description suggests it aims to 'wake up and get a boost of energy' which aligns with maintaining an elevated, feel-good energy level, especially in the context of a morning workout routine (confidence: 0.4). \n\nOverall, the video description and channel ethos suggest a calm, grounding practice, enhancing the connection with a 'Zen Flow' primary vibe."
