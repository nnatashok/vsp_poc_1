    "Great ride.  A beautiful view while I\u2019m buried in snow in Canada.",
    "\u2764 very scenic good pace and endless blue sky . Thank you!!! Im almost 70. Cycling this way with a good video is wonderul all you young making these videos are doing us older folks the best gift ever. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5hA5t5Caw&amp;t=1607\">26:47</a>",
    "A well paced hour on my bike. Thank you for all your wonderful videos.",
    "Absolutely amazing. This guy is so generous with his time to put the tech and video together. Indoor cycling (for me) has never been such fun until now. I\u2019d love to be where he is on my road bike, but until then this will be my go to place. (Bit surprised by what looked like close passes on these lovely roads - maybe it\u2019s just camera angles) . Thanks , keep it up. I will tip."
