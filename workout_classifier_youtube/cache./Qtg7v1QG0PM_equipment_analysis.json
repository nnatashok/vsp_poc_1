  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is a short morning yoga session designed to energize and remove sleepiness, as indicated in the title and description. Yoga practices typically require a mat for comfort and stability during floor poses and movements. Given the nature of the vinyasa flow mentioned in the tags, a mat is essential to provide traction and prevent slipping during transitions. The confidence score is set at 0.9 due to the central role a mat plays in yoga practices, and although it isn't explicitly mentioned in the title or description, it is highly implied through the content type and typical practice setup."
