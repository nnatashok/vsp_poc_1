  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is a yoga session for beginners, as indicated in the title \"20-Minute Yoga For Beginners\" and throughout the description. Yoga typically requires a mat for comfort and stability during floor exercises, which is likely the case here despite not being explicitly mentioned. The tags and description highlight the practice of various poses for different body parts such as the spine, hips, shoulders, and core, which are traditionally performed on a yoga mat. Additionally, the description mentions the practice is suitable for anyone, suggesting a simple setup that doesn't require more equipment beyond a yoga mat, aligning with the typical setup for beginner yoga sessions. Therefore, a mat is identified as required equipment with high confidence."
