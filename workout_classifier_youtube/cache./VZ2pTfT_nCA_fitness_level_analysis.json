  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is labeled as a chair workout predominantly targeting beginners, as indicated by tags like \"chair workout for beginners\" and \"seated ab exercises.\" Chair workouts typically involve simple, seated movements that require minimal coordination or balance, aligning with beginner-level technique. Additionally, the description emphasizes its suitability for those with back problems, suggesting a focus on safety and basic movements. However, the inclusion of phrases like 'seated fat burn workout' implies some intermediate aspects due to potential higher intensity, warranting a minor score for intermediate level.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout is a short, 10-minute session, indicating a lighter effort difficulty primarily. This is reinforced by its short duration and the use of a chair, suggesting a lower impact and energy expenditure suitable for beginners. The tags emphasize 'seated belly fat workout' and 'lose belly fat sitting down,' both geared towards a less intense exercise approach. However, comments mention heart rate increase and labeling the workout as a form of HIIT, which might elicit moderate energy expenditure, justifying a moderate score.",

The comments show diverse age groups participating, indicating that while it is beginner-friendly, it can also be adjusted to an intermediate level by increasing intensity or pairing with other workouts, as some users have done. Advanced participants could benefit by integrating it with more strenuous activities for a comprehensive routine, meriting a small score for advanced users."
