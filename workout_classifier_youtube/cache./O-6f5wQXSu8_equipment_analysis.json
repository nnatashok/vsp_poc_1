  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled '10-Minute Meditation For Anxiety' is a guided meditation, focusing on calming the mind and relieving anxiety. The metadata, including the title, description, and tags, does not mention any physical exercises or the need for supportive equipment. Guided meditations typically require minimal or no physical props. The only potential equipment that might be used during a meditation session is a mat, for those who prefer to sit comfortably on the floor; however, this is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the metadata. Additionally, the comments focus on the emotional and mental experience of meditation, with no remarks about physical equipment. Thus, this meditation video appears to be bodyweight only, requiring no equipment."
