  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Treadmill' with a high score of 0.9. This is directly indicated by the title '15 Minute Beginner Workout: Treadmill Virtual Scenery (Slow Jog/Fast Walk)' and further supported by tags such as 'virtual treadmill' and 'treadmill', confirming that the workout is designed for use on a treadmill. The 'Walking' category is also relevant with a score of 0.6, as the workout involves a 'fast walk', explicitly mentioned in both the title and description. Additionally, the tagging and focus on walking in the description ('Check out my other walking videos here') further justify this classification. Lastly, the 'Running' category is assigned a score of 0.4 since the video includes a 'slow jog', as indicated in the title and description ('The pace is a slow jog or fast walk'), suggesting a moderate influence of jogging in the workout. The tags 'jog' and 'jogging' also contribute to this classification. The channel's overall focus on scenic workouts and nature is consistent with providing virtual treadmill experiences."
