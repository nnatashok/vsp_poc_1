  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is well-suited for 'Flow & Rhythm' with a score of 0.7, due to its emphasis on continuous movement and adaptability to small spaces. This is supported by the title and description mentioning a '30 MIN FULL BODY WORKOUT' that is 'apartment & small space friendly,' suggesting a structured but smooth approach to accommodate limited space without jumping. The high view count and likes also indicate a large audience finding a rhythmic workout engaging.\n\nThe 'High-Energy & Intense' spirit has a moderate match with a score of 0.5, given the comments about sweating and leg shaking despite being low-impact ('no jumping/no noise' mentioned in the description). This implies a level of intensity achieved through a sustained effort over 30 minutes.\n\nLastly, there's a 'Structured & Disciplined' element with a score of 0.4. The inclusion of warm-up and cool-down links in the description signals a methodical approach to exercise. However, the lack of equipment and space constraints lessen the strictness often associated with this spirit. Hence, the lower score."
