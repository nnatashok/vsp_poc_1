    "Honestly, I am very happy this video doesn&#39;t have ads.",
    "Thank u for including that adorable little face, it may sound funny but there was additional comfort from that. \ud83d\ude0c",
    "I was stressed, I could feel muscles in my face twitching. <br>This slow paced video made me want to do something else but I persevered because that was exactly what I needed, I had to slow down, be quiet for 10 minutes and just breathe. It&#39;s so simple, yet during the day I didn&#39;t realize I was just losing it. <br>I&#39;m still not 100% but I&#39;m for sure better than I was before the video, thank you for this!",
    "I honestly wanna cry with how well this helped, it\u2019s currently 3 am and I was randomly having a sudden burst of anxiety and having an attack. Some push-ups did help a bit but this helped way more",
    "I posted a comment on here a few months ago, but then I wussed out and deleted it, so I&#39;ll say it again.  As an alcoholic, this video is incredible for reducing the anxiety that I feel.  I just finished rehab (not cured, but doing better),  and I showed this to my roommate during those first, terrifying, agonizing 48 hours.  It calmed them down until they could have more medicine.  I love how there is no annoying, overly-sweet voice in this video.  Just a calm, normal-sounding voice."
