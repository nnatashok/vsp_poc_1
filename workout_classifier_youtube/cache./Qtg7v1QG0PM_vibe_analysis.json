  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe for this workout is 'The Zen Flow' with a high score of 0.9. This classification is supported by terms like 'morning yoga', 'energize', and 'breathe and flow' which suggest a breath-focused, calm, and intentional experience that aligns well with zen flow practices. The mention of vinyasa yoga and a short, fluid practice also supports this vibe, as it implies a grounding and intentionally paced session. The secondary vibe 'The Reboot Workout' scores 0.7 because the class is described as 'to energize and get you ready for a great day', indicating a gentle yet revitalizing experience that aims to refresh and remove sleepiness. These elements also suggest a low-stress, holistic approach typical of a reboot session. Other vibes like 'The Groove Session' or 'The Meditative Grind' were not suitable as the session lacks the fun, expressive focus or repetition-driven endurance typical of these categories. The overall confidence is high given the clear focus on vitality and grounding, emphasized across the video metadata."
