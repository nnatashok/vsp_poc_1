  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled \"Low impact, beginner, fat burning, home cardio workout. ALL standing!\" suggests that the workout is entirely standing and suitable for beginners, focusing on low-impact cardio. The absence of mentions of specific equipment in the title, description, tags, and channel information indicates a likely focus on bodyweight exercises. The top comments and available metadata highlight the accessibility of the workout, reinforcing the idea that it is designed to be performed without additional equipment. Therefore, it appears to be a bodyweight-only workout, requiring no specific equipment to perform."
