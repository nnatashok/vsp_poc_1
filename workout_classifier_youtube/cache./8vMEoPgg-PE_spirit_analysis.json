  "spiritsExplanation": "The video titled 'You Are Life Itself \u2014 Guided Meditation with Mooji' is clearly positioned as a calming and introspective session, making 'Soothing & Restorative' the dominant spirit with a score of 0.95. The metadata emphasizes meditation, self-realization, and spiritual awakening, which aligns with the gentle, healing, and recovery-focused qualities of the Soothing spirit. Words such as 'guided meditation,' 'peace,' 'awareness,' 'bliss,' and 'completeness' further support this classification. The channel's focus on spirituality and self-inquiry reinforces this assessment.\n\nAdditionally, a secondary spirit of 'Flow & Rhythm' is relevant, although less prominently, with a score of 0.5. The guided meditation could involve a rhythmic or continuous dialogue or music that guides participants, fostering a mind-body connection typical of Flow activities, supported by terms like 'presence,' 'mantra,' and 'contemplation' in the tags. \n\nThe other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense,' 'Sport & Agility,' 'Outdoor & Adventure,' and 'Structured & Disciplined' are excluded due to the absence of relevant indicators in the metadata, such as high intensity, sports techniques, outdoor environment, or structured physical routines."
