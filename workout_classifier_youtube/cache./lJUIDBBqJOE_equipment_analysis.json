  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is explicitly described as a '30min Full Body Stretching Routine perfect for Rest Days,' and the description states 'No Equipment needed. Just prepare a soft surface like a yoga mat or towel.' This suggests that while no traditional exercise equipment is needed, a mat is highly recommended to provide comfort on the floor during stretching exercises. The confidence score for a 'Mat' is very high (0.8) because it is directly mentioned in the description, indicating it is a key component for performing the stretching routine comfortably."
