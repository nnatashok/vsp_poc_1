  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is explicitly labeled as 'No Equipment' both in the title and the description, indicating that this is a bodyweight-only workout. The description reinforces this by stating 'No Equipment' under the workout details section. The absence of any equipment mentions in the tags, which highlight the workout's intensity and full-body focus, further supports this. Additionally, the channel's focus on home workouts and the emphasis on bodyweight exercises align with the 'No Equipment' theme. Therefore, there is very high confidence that this workout requires no equipment."
