    "Whenever I&#39;ve taken a break from strength training I always come back to this series. When I first started training with Caroline&#39;s videos I was doing push ups against the wall, nearly everything on my knees and still my arms were too exhausted to do more than ten minutes of this workout. <br>But 4 years later, I&#39;m doing tricep pushups on my toes, and I did this whole workout with no modifications whatsoever! Thank you Caroline! And thanks to this community for always leaving encouraging comments \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude18",
    "66 year old here. Did this work out. But I had to pause frequently as I was literally collapsing. But as soon as I recovered after a few seconds I continued. I am determined. I will not give up. I know I can do this. Thank you Caroline. Your friendliness has really helped."
