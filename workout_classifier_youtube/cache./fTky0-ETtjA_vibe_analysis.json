  "vibesExplanation": "The video is characterized primarily as a 'Masterclass Workout' vibe with a 0.7 score due to its technique-driven approach as indicated by the focus on resistance and form, even with light weights. The instructor emphasizes precision and technique ('pretend you're moving your arms through melted chocolate'), which aligns with a skill-building Pilates session. Comments from viewers support this by noting the effectiveness of small weight use ('my arms, chest, shoulders, and upper back were on FIRE'), highlighting the technical aspect. \n\nAdditionally, a 'Meditative Grind' vibe scores 0.6, as the workout promotes a repetitive, focused exercise flow without music distraction, fostering a zone-in feeling. The guidance and light-hearted commentary also provide a calming structure that encourages focused progression.\n\nLastly, the 'Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe scores 0.5, driven by the suggestion of an accompanying Spotify playlist and the fluid, rhythmically engaging movements typical of Pilates ('quick but effective'). The brief yet effective nature of the workout also aligns with this vibe, although less predominant than the first two identified."
