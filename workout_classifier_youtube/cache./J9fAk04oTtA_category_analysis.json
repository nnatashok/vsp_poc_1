  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is clearly classified as \"Indoor biking\" with a score of 1.0 due to explicit references in the title and description to indoor cycling, including terms like \"Indoor Cycling Workout,\" \"cycling workout,\" and \"indoor cycling training,\" indicating a stationary bike workout. Additionally, the use of tags such as \"spin class,\" \"indoor trainer,\" \"cycling session,\" and \"spin\" further reinforce this categorization.\n\nThe video also falls under the \"HIIT\" category with a score of 0.7. The description mentions \"VO2 Max Intervals\" and sets involving \"2 min broken down into 30s seated, 30s out of the saddle attack, back in the saddle,\" which are indicative of high-intensity interval protocols. The emphasis on intensity in comments and description, such as \"will get you fit very quickly,\" also supports this.\n\nGiven the focus on cycling and interval training, categories like \"Mat,\" \"Yoga,\" or \"Weight workout\" are excluded, as there is no indication of exercises beyond indoor biking intervals."
