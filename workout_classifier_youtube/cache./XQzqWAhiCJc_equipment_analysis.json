  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata suggests that the workout is a stretching routine focusing on mobility and flexibility, which typically involves floor exercises. The tags mention terms like \"full body stretch yoga\" and \"lying down stretch,\" which strongly imply the use of a Mat for comfort and support during these movements. Additionally, the description emphasizes active recovery and releasing tension, which are commonly associated with exercises performed on a Mat. However, there is no explicit mention of equipment in the title or description, which is why the confidence level is set moderately high at 0.6."
