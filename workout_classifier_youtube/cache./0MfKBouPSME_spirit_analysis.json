  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit identified is 'Structured & Disciplined,' as evidenced by the workout's detailed and methodical approach. The title and description emphasize 'Traditional Full Body Strength Training' and mention a specific structure of 8 exercises repeated three times with precise timing (45 seconds work, 15 seconds rest). This focus on repetition, progression, and the requirement of good form at a slow tempo embodies the 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit with a very high confidence score of 1.0.\n\nA secondary spirit identified is 'High-Energy & Intense,' with a strong match score of 0.65. The emphasis on using heavy weights and the encouraging comments about feeling strong and powerful suggest intense effort and energy, although the workout is not primarily about fast-paced movements.\n\nOther spirits such as 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were not considered due to the absence of seamless movement patterns, emphasis on recovery, or relaxation. The metadata strongly supports structure and intensity over any other possible spirits."
