  "channelDescription": "Quick + effective home workouts that get results! Like stronger than you've ever been kind of results. \n\nI'm Lindsey Bomgren, Certified Personal Trainer + Pre-and-Postnatal Fitness Instructor, and mom of 3 littles. \n\nAs a busy mom, I\u2019m all about quick and effective home workouts! I truly feel that doing the physically hard stuff makes you more capable of handling all the mentally challenging things that come at you daily. I don\u2019t film workout videos to give you six pack abs or a nice butt. I film workout videos because I know fitness makes me a better wife, mother, friend and human and I want to share that with you. \n\nI pray you find the workout inspiration + motivation you were seeking when you stumbled over here. Give me 10-30 minutes of your time today and I bet you\u2019ll come back for more tomorrow!\n\nPray often. Move your body. Eat your veggies. Love others + yourself.\n",

    "Absolutely LOVE you and your channel. Former D1 volleyball player and I\u2019ve always felt like I have to kill myself in the gym for hours to get any results or feel like I accomplished something. You have changed my mindset completely. I feel athletic and accomplished, and my 3 kiddos love to jump in with me, too! Not to mention your faith in Jesus is the BIGGEST BONUS! \u2764",
    "I honestly to Pete am humbled by your ability to continue talking to us, rooting for us, keeping your time and count, and still crush this workout. My kids walk in and I have to hit pause and give them the 1 finger &quot;give me a minute&quot; sign just to catch my breath and talk to them \ud83d\ude02. You rock coach!",
    "Did this work out while up in the playroom with the kids! I feel accomplished now! \u2764 thanks for all that you do, you have th best job!!",
    "I can\u2019t get over how much I appreciate having a high impact and low impact option for each Nourish, Move, Love workout! I had another breast biopsy a week ago today and my doctor cleared me to walk, ONLY, for a week. Today felt amazing keeping up with Rachel (sorry if I misspelled your name\ud83d\ude2c) after a week of walking plus AC Chemo Infusion 2 yesterday. I don\u2019t feel nausea, my worst side effect, during workouts. So thank you to the Lindsey and Rachel for providing nausea relief in the day. And thank you Jesus that I live in the 21st century and can do YouTube Workouts in the comfort of my own home \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe",
    "Thank you for this!! You got this retired college athlete working out again...I was so burned out after required weight training that I HATED even hearing the word &quot;workout&quot;. I just turned 30 and know how important it is for my health and my future to work out and stay strong. Thank you for making engaging workouts!! You have made it FUN for me again."
