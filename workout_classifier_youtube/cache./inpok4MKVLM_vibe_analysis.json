  "vibesExplanation": "The primary vibe of the workout video '5-Minute Meditation You Can Do Anywhere' is 'The Deep Recharge' with a score of 0.9. This vibe is characterized by its focus on nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement, which aligns with the video's description of being a short meditation intended to 'reset your day in a positive way.' The use of tags such as 'soothing,' 'relaxation,' 'calm,' and 'stress relief,' along with the mention of 'incredibly soothing voice' in the description, strongly supports this classification. Additionally, the overwhelming focus on mindfulness and calm in the comments section further underlines this vibe.\n\nThe secondary vibe is 'The Zen Flow' with a score of 0.7. This vibe focuses on grounding, intentional, and breath-centered practices. The tags 'mindfulness meditation', 'mindfulness', and the emphasis on 'relaxing' music and voice align with this vibe. The guidance to 'ALLOW YOURSELF TO SMILE' as noted in the comments indicates a focus on intentionality and present moment awareness, supporting this vibe.\n\nOther potential vibes like 'The Reboot Workout' or 'The Mindful Walk' were considered but did not fit as strongly given the video's primary focus on meditation rather than physical movement or walk-based practice."
