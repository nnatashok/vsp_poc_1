  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is categorized as 'Mat' with a score of 0.7 because it requires a mat or soft surface, as mentioned in the description, suggesting that the exercises are performed on the floor. This is reinforced by the type of workout being a 'prenatal cardio' routine which typically includes low-impact, mat-based exercises to accommodate pregnancy changes. Furthermore, the inclusion of phrases such as 'big calorie burn' indicates some level of cardiovascular intensity, which supports this categorization. The 'Body weight' category is assigned a score of 0.5 due to the likely use of bodyweight exercises, as no additional equipment beyond a mat is mentioned. Although this is a prenatal workout, it\u2019s designed to engage cardiovascular fitness, hence the focus on bodyweight-centric, non-equipment exercises. Comments from users who participated also highlight the mat-based nature of the routine. This analysis is made with high confidence due to the specific description and the context provided by the channel's focus and user comments."
