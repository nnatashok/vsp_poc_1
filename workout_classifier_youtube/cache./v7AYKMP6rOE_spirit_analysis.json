  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirits for this video are 'Flow & Rhythm' and 'Soothing & Restorative'. This classification is drawn from several pieces of metadata. The title 'Yoga For Complete Beginners - 20 Minute Home Yoga Workout' suggests a beginner-friendly, smooth, and flowing routine, which aligns with 'Flow & Rhythm'. The emphasis on 'beginners' in both the title and tags indicates a focus on ease and accessibility, inherently involving gentle pacing and coordination, consistent with 'Flow & Rhythm' (score: 0.8). Additionally, the comments underscore emotional and physical betterment, particularly mentions of feeling good and dealing with anxiety, lending strong support for 'Soothing & Restorative' (score: 0.9), which promotes relaxation and stress reduction. Keywords such as 'find what feels good', 'mindful', and 'foundation' in the description advocate a calming, healing approach, excluding the more intense spirits. There is little evidence supporting 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', 'Sport & Agility', or 'Outdoor & Adventure' based on the focus on calmness, internal exploration, and feeling good as per the metadata."
