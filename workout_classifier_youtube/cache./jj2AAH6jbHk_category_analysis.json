  "categoriesExplanation": "This video primarily focuses on 'Stretching,' as evidenced by the title, description, and numerous tags such as 'stretching,' 'mobility routine,' 'flexibility routine,' and 'hip mobility exercises.' The video aims to improve internal and external hip rotation\u2014classic elements of a stretching routine, hence a high confidence score of 0.9 for the Stretching category. The 'Yoga' category was considered due to the 'yoga follow along' tag and the structured flow of poses typical in yoga, but the emphasis on hip-specific mobility reduces its overall weight, resulting in a moderate score of 0.5. 'Body weight' is included, given the channel's focus and the descriptor 'bodyweight warrior,' along with comments referring to physical positioning, garnering a lower score of 0.3 since the focus is more on flexibility and stretching rather than a comprehensive bodyweight workout."
