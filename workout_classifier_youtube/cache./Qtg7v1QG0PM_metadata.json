    "Your channel has been a LIFE changer for me. I&#39;ve lost 71lbs over the last year RELIGIOUSLY watching your content. My mobility, flexibility and overall general mental well-being have drastically improved because of you and Bre. The only time I weight lift (which I used to do 5 days a week, with little improvement and a costly gym membership), is work on back exercises with lightweight dumbbells.<br><br>\u2764\u2764 I genuinely cannot thank you enough \u2764\u2764",
