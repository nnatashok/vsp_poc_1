  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for the video strongly indicates that dumbbells are the only required equipment. This is evidenced by multiple mentions across different metadata elements. The title of the video explicitly states \"Dumbbell Strength Workout\", suggesting that dumbbells are central to the workout. Furthermore, the description mentions, \"All you need is a pair /set of dumbbells to go heavier or lighter where you need to,\" confirming their necessity. The tags also emphasize dumbbell use, with phrases like \"dumbbell workout,\" \"full body dumbbell workout,\" and \"30 minute dumbbell workout.\" These repeat across the tags and description, increasing the confidence that dumbbells are integral to the workout routine. The confidence score is set at 0.9 due to the explicit and consistent reference to dumbbells across all metadata elements."
