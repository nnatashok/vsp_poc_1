    "I been been doing this workout for about 2 months and my relatives keep saying that i changed just hearing that makes me happy thank you sooooo much for changing my life",
    "I have been doing various forms of physical conditioning from the age of 30 on. I am physically in good shape. At the age of 77, this workout taxes me just far enough into my safe heart rate without endangering me. This is a challenging, cardio intense workout. It accomplishes what HIIT workouts are supposed to. My basal metabolism remains elevated long into the day and my energy level is higher all day. Thank you for a great workout.",
    "I did this for 8 months, i was 80 Kg and now i am 66. I cannot thank you enough!",
    "I just wanted to thank you for providing these videos on YouTube for free.  I&#39;m a mother of 3 and don&#39;t currently have the option to get to the gym.  I love the variety of exercises, the time and intensity options with various videos, the music, and the positive energy.  Thank you so much! ",
    "Love this! No gimmicks, no unnecessary intros, good music, quick to the point, no ads, free, short and simple, good enough for any physical level. Thank you so much for posting!"
