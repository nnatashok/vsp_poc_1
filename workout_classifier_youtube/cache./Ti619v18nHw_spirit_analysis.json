  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is primarily classified as \"Soothing & Restorative\" due to several explicit indicators in the title and description such as \"Muscle Recovery,\" \"Flexibility and Relaxation,\" and \"Rest Day Stretch.\" The emphasis is on relaxation, recovery, and gentle stretching, which strongly aligns with this spirit, reflected in the metadata and user comments praising the calming nature of the routine. The high score of 0.9 is assigned due to these consistent cues across multiple data sources, indicating a very high degree of match.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of \"Flow & Rhythm\" is noted with a moderate score of 0.5. The description mentions \"a few flowing movements throughout\" and \"YOGA postures,\" suggesting an element of smooth, continuous movements typical of a yoga-inspired flow, which supports the mind-body connection aspect of this spirit.\n\nOther spirits like \"High-Energy & Intense\" or \"Sport & Agility\" are excluded due to the lack of any indicators of intensity, athletic training, or performance focus. The absence of outdoor elements also rules out \"Outdoor & Adventure.\""
