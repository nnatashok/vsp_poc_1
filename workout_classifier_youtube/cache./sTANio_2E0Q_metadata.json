    "With all the craziness and tense energy in the world right now, I think we could all use a few minutes to de-stress! \u2764\ufe0f I hope you all are well and staying safe! Remember to take care of yourselves. Stay informed, but don\u2019t overwhelm yourself with everything that is going on. Take some time to tune into you! Sending you love. Xx- Maddie",
    "I know many people won&#39;t read this?<br>But, I hope you are having a better day than you did yesterday. You&#39;ve made it this far. Don&#39;t quit now. God bless you!!",
    "Stretching is so under-rated! Our bodies are like glow sticks - we need to bend and crack them so that they light up inside!",
    "I am a COVID-19 positive patient and this has helped me breathe better by expanding and working my lungs.  It was enough that I can do it effectively and not get tired. Thank you.",
    "Might be the only stretch/yoga that I did without getting any bored. It feels super refreshing and relaxing. I literally forget abt the time while I&#39;m doing it. &lt;3"
