  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is categorized primarily as 'Meditation' due to specific language and context around guided meditation practices. The title directly mentions \"Guided Meditation,\" and the description refers to the video as a meditation designed to help reduce overthinking and stress. Additionally, tags such as 'guided meditation for overthinking' and 'meditation for stress and anxiety' reinforce the meditation context. The high view count and comments indicate user engagement with meditation content focused on mental clarity and stress relief. While there is a reference to yoga in the channel name and description, the lack of direct mention of yoga poses or practice in this video's metadata leads to focusing solely on 'Meditation.' Therefore, the primary category is 'Meditation' with a high confidence score of 0.9, as it is the central theme evidenced by explicit and repeated mentions across the metadata."
