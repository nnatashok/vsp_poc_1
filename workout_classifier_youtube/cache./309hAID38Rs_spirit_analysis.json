  "spiritsExplanation": "The video is primarily assigned to the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit with a score of 0.9. This high score is due to its focus on relaxation and stress relief, as evidenced by descriptors in the title ('Ultimate Relaxation Exercise') and tags ('relaxation techniques', 'stress relief'). The benefits highlighted, such as improving mental well-being and relieving stress, further support this classification. The channel 'Hands-On Meditation' also aligns with relaxation-oriented content, adding to the confidence level. \n\nThe secondary spirit, 'Structured & Disciplined,' is scored at 0.65. This score reflects the clear protocol in the breathing exercise: five structured rounds with specific breath-hold times. The description's emphasis on systematic progression in breath retention reinforces this classification. \n\nOther spirits were considered but excluded. 'Flow & Rhythm' was ruled out due to the lack of movement or music elements. 'High-Energy & Intense' was dismissed because the focus is on relaxation rather than intensity. No indicators support 'Sport & Agility' or 'Outdoor & Adventure.'"
