    "What training exercises would you like us to do?",
    "Bulgarian split squats literally saved my running journey!",
    "I&#39;ve seen people doing some of these exercises but I&#39;ve never done them myself.  Having Manni explain how they&#39;re done properly has now given me the confidence to try them for myself. Thank you. You&#39;ve inspired me to give it a go.",
    "That\u2019s a great, bite sized session. Looking forward to giving it a go and to any future installments. Thanks guys!",
    "It might have been nice for Manny to explain what the exercises were targeting and how that correlates to improving your running form. As a personal request, exercises to address a tight IT band that causes me hip pain/ bursitis."
