    "We are all only humans looking for something to feel less lonely, less scared. I pray for everyone to feel peace and safety \u2764",
    "It\u2019s so comforting to read these comments and realize that I am not alone in my struggles. That everything that I\u2019m experiencing, other are experiencing too. That everything is going to be okay. I\u2019m going to be okay. You\u2019re going to be okay.",
    "To you reading this right now... you are beautiful.  Everything will work itself out.   Everyone here knows how you feel right now.  This feeling sucks, but know that you will be be ok.  This too shall pass...Don\u2019t fight the anxiety, just allow it to work it\u2019s way through and Let it do its thing.  Embrace the moment as you become at peace with things.   Now I want you to close your eyes and place your hands in front of you and lightly wiggle your fingers like you\u2019re playing a piano.   You are shedding this off as we speak.  It\u2019s dripping off your fingertips...Feel it melt off yourself. See, there it goes......we love you .  At peace... at peace.... at peace...  at peace....\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf40\u2600\ufe0f\u2728\ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf40\ud83d\udc23\ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf40\u2600\ufe0f\u2728\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",
    "For a long period of time my mind has been overcome with stress to the point of playing games, hallucinating and see things that are just not there due to my intense stress levels of overthinking and ruminating over things that I have no control over. Since coming across your video and engaging in your meditation practice consistently and daily. I am now starting to see significant changes  my mind and total wellbeing is more relaxed too. Thank you so much you are a life saver. Much appreciated \ud83d\ude4f",
    "Wow... that helped, that really helped. I faced with quite an unpleasant situation that left me speechless, I couldn&#39;t breathe, I felt numb but with too many thoughts rushing through my mind. There were too many things to handle for me, so I needed help and I found it. It eased my mind, I could finally fall asleep. And as I write it in the morning I can say - I still feel great. The problem isn&#39;t gone but at least I can breathe. Thank you, guys, you do a marvellous job, more like magic. Love from Ukraine."
