    "No matter what it is you are going through, you can&#39;t live in the past. It&#39;s important to take it as a learning experience and grow from it. My heart goes out to anyone dealing with a difficult time \ud83d\udc9e\ud83e\udd17",
    "It&#39;s common for relationships to encounter obstacles, but there is always a solution. My own marriage faced considerable issues, but with appropriate guidance, my husband and I worked through them and deepened our connection. Solutions are achievable if you&#39;re ready to work together. Stay hopeful-there&#39;s always a way forward.",
    "Thank you. I didn\u2019t realize how much sadness I still had in my heart. I kept getting this uncomfortable agonizing feeling of sorrow and no hope while trying to keep in alignment and overcome detaching from friends who I\u2019ve out grown through my journey. I\u2019m glad I was able to find this feeling and let go. I truly wish to be happy and be at peace with myself and my life. I will continue to find happiness and peace and help others who support and love me to do the same \u2764",
    "&quot;The feeling of unworthiness&quot; man even as I type this again after I meditated to<br>it that made me going into a crying fit for 10 minutes. Didn&#39;t expect it...<br>I needed this so bad, thank you so much.",
