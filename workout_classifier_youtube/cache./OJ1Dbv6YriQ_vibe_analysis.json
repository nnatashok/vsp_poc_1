  "vibesExplanation": "This workout is classified primarily as \"The Foundation Builder\" because it focuses on building basic strength, with terms like \"beginner,\" \"seniors,\" and \"building strength\" prominently featured in the title and description. These indicate a foundational approach to strength training, aiming to strengthen weak points and perfect the basics, especially for beginners and seniors. The high confidence score (0.9) comes from the clear emphasis on technique and foundational strength building.\n\n\"The Comfort Moves\" also fits this workout due to the emphasis on gentle, beginner-friendly movements that are suitable for seniors, including the option to perform exercises while seated. Comments from older users appreciating the simplicity of the workout reinforce this vibe, fitting the feel-good, safe movement profile with a moderate confidence level (0.7).\n\nFinally, \"The Masterclass Workout\" is relevant because the video focuses on proper form and technique, with the instructor providing detailed guidance. This technique-driven focus is noted in both the description and viewer comments, warranting a score of 0.6, indicating a clear element of a \"Masterclass\" but not as dominant as the foundational focus."
