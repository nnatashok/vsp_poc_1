    "That clever bastard, making us meditate longer without realising it had ended.",
    "this one guided mediation is the one that ALWAYS does it for me. Love that theres no music, no crazy fantasy visualizations.. just super simple and you fade away and don&#39;t even realize he stopped talking.",
    "Notice the tinnitus ringing in your ears, let the hiss from your damaged hearing remind you of peaceful ocean waves...",
    "I didn&#39;t even realize the meditation was done, lol. Thanks Sam. :)"
