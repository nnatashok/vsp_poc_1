  "categoriesConfidence": 0.95,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Stretching' (score: 1.0) due to the video's clear focus on full-body stretching exercises, as evidenced by the title '15-Min Full-Body Stretching Routine' and repeated emphasis on stretching throughout the description, tags, and content outline. Tags like 'stretching routine,' 'flexibility routine,' and 'full body stretch' further support this categorization, and the mention of 'Science of Stretching' aligns with the channel's specialization in flexibility training.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Yoga' (score: 0.6), stemming from the association with the channel 'YOGABODY,' the inclusion of yoga-related tags, and the comments from viewers who relate the routine to yoga practices. Although the routine is not explicitly described as a yoga session, the overlap in stretching techniques often found in yoga practices made this a relevant secondary category.\n\nFinally, 'Breathing exercises' (score: 0.4) is included due to the video's emphasis on using breathing to enhance stretching effectiveness, as explained in the 'Anatomy of Stretching' section. This connection is reinforced by the channel's known focus on breathing training, indicating a moderate presence in the routine. Other categories were excluded as there is no indication of equipment use or high-intensity workouts."
