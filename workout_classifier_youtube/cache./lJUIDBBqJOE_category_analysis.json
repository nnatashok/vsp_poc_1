  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily as 'Stretching' (score: 0.9) due to the consistent emphasis on stretching exercises throughout the metadata. The title, \"30 MIN FULL BODY STRETCHING,\" and description explicitly highlight this focus by mentioning the routine is perfect for rest days and designed to increase mobility and flexibility. The description further details specific body parts targeted, such as the neck, hamstrings, and hip flexors, reinforcing the stretching focus. User comments, like referring to the routine as relaxing yet challenging, also align with stretching objectives.\n\nA secondary classification as 'Yoga' (score: 0.4) is considered due to the description mentioning calming down before bed and relaxing, which are common attributes associated with yoga routines, although no explicit mention of yoga poses is present. This secondary classification is speculative, hence a lower score.\n\nOther categories like 'Mat' or 'Body weight' were considered but not chosen due to the absence of cardio or strength indicators typical of such workouts."
