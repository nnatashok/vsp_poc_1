  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video metadata indicates that this is a guided meditation video, specifically focused on manifesting one's desired reality. The title, description, and tags consistently emphasize meditation, manifestation, and mental visualization. No physical exercises requiring equipment are mentioned; rather, the focus is on mental relaxation and mindfulness. Additionally, the video's channel, 'Great Meditation,' specializes in producing original guided meditations, further confirming that this video is not exercise-based. Therefore, no physical equipment is needed, as the practice is bodyweight-only (mental focus rather than physical activity)."
