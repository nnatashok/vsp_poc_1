  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata for this video indicates that it is a guided meditation session. The title, description, and tags all emphasize meditation and connecting with one's higher self. There is no mention of any physical exercises or equipment needed, as meditation typically involves sitting or reclining in a comfortable position. The focus is on reflective and mental engagement rather than physical activity. Therefore, there is no equipment required for this meditation-based workout. This conclusion is supported by the complete absence of references to any physical equipment or exercise techniques in the description, tags, and comments, suggesting a bodyweight-only session focused on mindfulness."
