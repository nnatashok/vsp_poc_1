  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "Although the video duration is approximately 30 minutes, potentially shifting it towards a more moderate effort level, the workout is described as 'low impact' and 'no jumping,' suggesting a lower overall intensity. The exercises listed, like lateral steps and leg kicks, do not imply vigorous energy expenditure. However, since the duration is close to the 30-minute mark and given comments about weight loss achievements, it could still pose a moderate challenge for completely deconditioned individuals.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level primarily aligns with 'Beginner' due to the low impact and simple nature of exercises that accommodate lower body issues and knee problems. However, the video duration is nearly 30 minutes, which might be challenging for absolute novices over a longer period or for individuals looking to push a bit harder; hence 'Intermediate' is also included with moderate alignment. 'Advanced' is included with mild alignment, reflecting the possibility that even straightforward exercises can be performed at higher intensities over a longer duration to remain beneficial for more experienced users, though these exercises won't technically challenge advanced fitness levels."
