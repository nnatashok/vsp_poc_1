  "categoriesExplanation": "The workout video is classified primarily under 'HIIT' with a score of 0.9. This is strongly supported by the title and description that explicitly mention a '10 Min HIIT/CARDIO Workout.' The emphasis on a high-intensity workout to replace treadmill routines and build muscle aligns with typical characteristics of HIIT, including the alternation between periods of intense exercise and short rest, as noted in the description and reflected in top comments about requiring rest time. The secondary classification as 'Body weight' with a score of 0.6 is based on the mention of 'No Equipment Needed' in the tags and description, indicating that exercises are performed using one's own body weight. Although 'Calisthenics' is mentioned, it is less emphasized, thus 'Body weight' is more appropriate considering the video format and content guidelines. The metadata, especially from the tags and description, did not support significant consideration of the 'Treadmill' category, as the workout is presented as a substitute rather than involving a treadmill itself."
