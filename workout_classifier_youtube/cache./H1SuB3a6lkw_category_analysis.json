  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is predominantly classified as 'HIIT' with a score of 1.0, based on multiple clear indicators in the title and description, such as 'CRAZY INTENSE 5 Minute Full Body HIIT WORKOUT' and 'high-intensity interval training.' The structure involves short, intense work periods separated by rest, aligning perfectly with the classic HIIT framework.\n\nAdditionally, 'Body weight' is assigned a score of 0.8. This is supported by phrases like 'Bodyweight Beat Down' and 'Bodyweight Workout,' indicating that the exercises exclusively use bodyweight resistance, such as Jumping Jacks, Squats with Knee Tuck, and Burpees. This entirely aligns with the definition of body weight training as described in the metadata.\n\nThe evidence is highly explicit with consistent mentions across the title, description, and tags, leading to a very high confidence level (0.9) for these categories. Other categories were excluded due to the lack of any equipment-based exercises or specific focus on different workout styles like yoga or Pilates."
