  "vibesExplanation": "The video is best classified under 'The Warrior Workout' vibe with a score of 0.85. The metadata emphasizes a 'high intensity' nature through the use of phrases such as 'sweaty session,' 'heart rate up,' and the inclusion of various forms of burpees and squat jumps, indicating a demanding and primal nature typical of The Warrior Workout.\n\n'Adrenaline Rush' is also a fitting classification with a score of 0.75, as the workout includes exercises like burpees, lunges, and mountain climbers done at a fast pace, suggesting unpredictable challenges and high full-body intensity, which matches the description of an Adrenaline Rush.\n\nThe 'Firestarter' vibe is present with a score of 0.65 as the workout is explosive and fast-paced, especially with intervals being only 30 seconds long, which is characteristic of a short but intense burst of activity, like in Tabata or sprint workouts. However, its length (30 minutes) diminishes the certainty of it being a pure Firestarter.\n\nThe groove-like, meditative, or dance elements typical of other vibes are notably absent, corroborating a high-confidence vibe classification focused on intensity and full-body engagement."
