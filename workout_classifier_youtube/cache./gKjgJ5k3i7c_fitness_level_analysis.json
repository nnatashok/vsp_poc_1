  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video title '30 MIN YOGA WORKOUT || Heart Opening Feel Good Flow' indicates a flow that likely involves sequences requiring continuous movement and coordination, typical of yoga workouts. The description mentions 'heart opening sequences,' suggesting intermediate-level yoga poses that require some flexibility and coordination. The channel's host is a certified yoga instructor, which may indicate more precise instruction and slightly advanced elements. However, the overall 'feel good' flow and the comments reflecting a calming and energizing effect, suggest it's not the most technically challenging workout. The presence of 'work the core' implies some moderately complex movements, as engaging the core often demands more control.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The workout duration is 34:45, which exceeds the 20-minute threshold, suggesting it might not be entirely light in effort. However, yoga is typically less demanding in terms of cardiovascular exertion. User comments describe the workout as a 'gentle calming low-impact workout,' indicating it fits between light to moderate effort levels. The description's focus on flowing and opening suggests a continuous, steady effort, rather than intense bursts that characterize more strenuous workouts. Additionally, the relaxing and feel-good nature of the class, as described by users, suggests a moderate intensity.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Given the technique difficulty and effort difficulty, the workout is suitable for a broad range of fitness levels. The technique difficulty suggests beginners with some experience may find it accessible, especially given the calming and energizing nature described by users. Intermediate users are likely to appreciate the flow and core work, fitting their skill level, while advanced users may enjoy the depth of the stretch and core engagement despite potentially seeking more challenging endeavors. The video length suggests intermediate users might find it most appropriately challenging, but the calming aspect described aligns it well for beginners looking for more than basic workouts."
