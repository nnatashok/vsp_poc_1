  "spiritsExplanation": "The spirit of this workout predominantly aligns with 'Soothing & Restorative', indicated by terms such as 'gentle', 're-connect with your body and breath', and the emphasis on it being suitable for 'morning or evening practice' to gently move the body. User comments further reinforce this with mentions of its suitability for those recovering from illness or in need of less strenuous activity. The high level of appreciation from users dealing with physical and mental health challenges underscores its restorative qualities, justifying a strong score of 0.9.\n\nThe presence of 'Flow & Rhythm' as a secondary spirit is supported by the term 'flow' in the tags and the holistic movement style typical of Pilates. The instructor's background as a professional dancer implies some emphasis on smooth and continuous movement, warranting a score of 0.6 for this spirit.\n\nOther spirits, such as 'High-Energy & Intense', 'Structured & Disciplined', 'Sport & Agility', and 'Outdoor & Adventure', were excluded due to the explicit focus on gentle movements and restorative purposes rather than high intensity, technical precision, or outdoor elements."
