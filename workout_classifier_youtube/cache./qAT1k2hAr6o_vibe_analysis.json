  "vibesExplanation": "The '20-min BODYWEIGHT Full Body Workout' video primarily fits The Meditative Grind vibe due to the moderate tempo and repetitive focus on building strength and muscle with compound movements. The title and description emphasize bodyweight exercises, muscle building, and endurance, suggesting a zone-in mentality. Hence, it scores a 0.75 due to descriptors like 'moderate tempo per rep' and focus on 'core moves.' \n\nThe Progression Quest vibe is also applicable as the workout helps improve strength and muscle through methodical, incremental efforts, with bodyweight exercises often used for steady, progressive development. Comments about modifications and suitability for broader audiences support this, scoring it at 0.7.\n\nFinally, elements of The Warrior Workout are present through phrases like 'crush this workout' and 'ramp up calorie burn,' indicating some intensity typical of warrior-style workouts. While not the primary vibe, its inclusion of strength, compound movements, and cardio elements justifies a 0.65 score. Other vibes like The Groove Session or The Nightclub Workout were excluded due to the lack of focus on music or dance elements."
