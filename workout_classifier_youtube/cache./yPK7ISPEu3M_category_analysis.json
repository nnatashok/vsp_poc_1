  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Yoga' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is due to explicit indications in the title (\"15 Min Daily Yoga Flow\") and description (\"full body yoga routine\"), which strongly point to a yoga workout. Additionally, the channel is a dedicated yoga channel with a certified Yoga Teacher, further reinforcing the classification. The description emphasizes a complete daily yoga practice, aligning with the typical characteristics of a yoga session.\n\nThe secondary category 'Stretching' is included with a moderate score of 0.4. While the video's emphasis is on yoga, comments and the nature of yoga itself suggest elements of flexibility and stretching are involved (e.g., \"to ease my way into the practice\" and \"to start my day\"). However, since stretching is a component of the broader yoga practice presented, it is less central to the video's primary focus, thus the lower score.\n\nNo other categories such as 'Pilates' or 'Breathing exercises' were relevant, as the metadata consistently directed towards a yoga-centric workout without emphasis on pilates techniques or standalone breathing exercises."
