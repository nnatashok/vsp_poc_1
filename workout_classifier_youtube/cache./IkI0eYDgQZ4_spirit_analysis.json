  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary workout spirit identified is 'Outdoor & Adventure' (score: 0.9), which is strongly supported by the video's location and activities mentioned: 'outdoors,' 'at the beach,' and 'calisthenics park,' as evidenced in both the title, description, and tags (e.g., 'park workout,' 'beach workout,' 'santa monica workout'). These elements emphasize a nature-based, environmental exploration aspect intrinsic to this spirit. 'Structured & Disciplined' (score: 0.7) is also a suitable fit due to the progression from 'BEGINNER to ADVANCED' calisthenics, implying a methodical approach to skill development in a disciplined fashion, as evidenced by terms like 'tutorial' and the structured progression mentioned in metadata. Finally, 'Sport & Agility' (score: 0.6) is included due to the focus on exercises like pull-ups, chin-ups, and muscle-ups, which are performance-based and emphasize athletic skills\u2014common in calisthenics, as exemplified by 'muscle up,' 'handstand push-up tutorial' in the tags. While 'High-Energy & Intense' could be a candidate, the absence of explicit intensity cues (e.g., 'fast-paced') reduced its relevance."
