  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Yoga' with a very high confidence score of 1.0. This classification is based on strong explicit indicators in both the title ('20 Minute Yoga For Beginners And Athletes') and description ('20 minute yoga flow practice'), suggesting a focus on yoga exercises. Tags such as 'vinyasa yoga', 'yoga practice', 'yoga flow', and 'full body yoga' further confirm this is a yoga-focused workout. The channel, \"Breathe and Flow,\" is dedicated to yoga, offering additional confirmation. The comments and channel description reinforce the yoga focus, with users mentioning how the video contributes to mindfulness and flexibility, typical outcomes of yoga. A secondary, minor classification under 'Other' is noted due to references to 'functional movement' and 'bodywork' in the channel's broader offerings, suggesting a potential inclusion of other elements outside traditional yoga practice, although not strongly present in this video."
