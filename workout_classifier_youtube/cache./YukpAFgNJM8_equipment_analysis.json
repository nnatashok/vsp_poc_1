  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video focuses on a low-impact workout suitable for PCOS, combining both cardio and strength training, which suggests exercises might be performed on the floor. The metadata mentions yoga and pilates in relation to the workout, and these exercises typically require a mat for comfort and support during floor-based movements. Although no specific mention of a mat is found in the tags or comments, the inference can be drawn from the nature of the exercises described in the title and description. Therefore, the confidence score is moderately high at 0.75 based on the likely necessity for a mat."
