  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled 'CHILLED CARDIO WORKOUT | No Equipment, No Repeat, No Jumping' explicitly mentions in the description that 'All you will need is your body warmed up, your mat and a bottle of water handy!' This clearly indicates that a mat is needed for the workout, likely for exercises done on the floor such as the 'hover to plank', 'single leg down dog to hover', and other floor-based movements. The confidence level is very high (0.9) based on the explicit mention of the mat in the description, which is consistent with the need for floor exercises and the careful choice of wording ensuring no other equipment besides a mat is required. No other equipment is mentioned in the title, tags, or description, supporting that it's a primarily bodyweight routine."
