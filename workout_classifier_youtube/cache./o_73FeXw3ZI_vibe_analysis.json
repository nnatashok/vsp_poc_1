  "vibesExplanation": "The workout video from 'Breathe and Flow' primarily aligns with 'The Zen Flow' vibe due to its focus on 'vinyasa yoga' and 'functional movement,' as indicated by the tags and description. The session is grounded, intentional, and breath-centered, fitting the 'Zen Flow' category with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is reinforced by the channel's emphasis on tranquility and mental stillness, as described in their channel info. The practice's morning routine element, meant to be calming and grounding, further supports this classification.\n\nAdditionally, elements of 'The Groove Session' are present, as the practice is 'fluid' and 'expressive,' characteristic of a fun and immersive experience, although evidence is not as strong. Therefore, it's assigned a moderate score of 0.5. The structured yet relaxed nature of the workout and the channel's focus on a holistic, expressive yoga experience justifies this secondary vibe.\n\nThe Warrior Workout or Firestarter vibes are not applicable because of the absence of high intensity or explosive elements typically associated with those workouts."
