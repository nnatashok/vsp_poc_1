  "title": "Relieve Stress & Anxiety with Simple Breathing Techniques",
  "description": "Breathing exercises can be a great way to help relieve stress and anxiety. This video focuses on two relaxing breathing techniques: Square breathing (aka box breathing, 4x4 breathing, 4-part breath, etc.) and Pursed breathing. More breathing exercises: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7-CAFhJn78\n\n\r\rI start off with Square breathing. It\u2019s so good at helping to relieve stress and anxiety that it\u2019s sometimes used in the military to help calm nerves before stressful situations.\n\nIt\u2019s performed just how it sounds--using your breath to make a square. Use imagery as well and imagine making a square or following something with a square pattern with your breath. Each position is 4 seconds. Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, and hold your breath again for 4 seconds. \n\n\r\rPursed breathing is another breathing technique that can help relieve stress and anxiety, and it can also help make your lungs stronger. For this one, use diaphragmatic or belly breathing. Breathe in for 4 seconds, and then breathe out with pursed lips for 8 seconds.\n\nRelated Videos:\n\nBreathing Exercises for Relaxation or COPD:\nhttps://youtu.be/-7-CAFhJn78\n\nBreathing Exercises for COPD, Asthma, Bronchitis & Emphysema:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpTNUGwXbTU\n\n\r\r===========================================\n\nDr. Jo is a licensed Physical Therapist and Doctor of Physical Therapy.\n\nSUPPORT Ask Doctor Jo on Patreon for as little as $1 a month, and get cool rewards: http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo\n\n\r\r===========================================\r\n\nRelieve Stress & Anxiety with Simple Breathing Techniques\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odADwWzHR24\nhttps://www.askdoctorjo.com/breathing-techniques-stress-relief\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.
