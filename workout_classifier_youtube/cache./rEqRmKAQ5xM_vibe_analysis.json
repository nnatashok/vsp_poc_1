  "vibesExplanation": "The workout mainly attracts 'The Meditative Grind' vibe, as indicated by its repetitive, endurance-focused structure with steady spinning in the saddle, typical of stationary cycling. This matches the sense of being able to 'zone in' and 'let repetition take over.' Furthermore, with a tone directed at beginners, the focus is on building a rhythm rather than intense bursts, supporting a steady, controlled progression (Score: 0.75). 'The Endorphin Wave' vibe is also present due to the uplifting, feel-good nature typically associated with cycling workouts, aided by music and a progressive intensity in warm-up, main cycling, and cool-down stages, encouraging an elevation of energy throughout the session (Score: 0.65). High confidence in these choices is due to explicit mentions in the description and tags emphasizing beginner-friendly, endurance cycling with musical cues."
