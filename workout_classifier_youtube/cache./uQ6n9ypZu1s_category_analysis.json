  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary focus of the video is clearly on 'Breathing exercises,' as indicated by the title, \"Guided Breathing Exercise Meditation Panic Attacks & Anxiety,\" and the description, which specifically mentions a \"guided breathing meditation for panic attacks and anxiety.\" This suggests a strong emphasis on breathing techniques specifically designed to help manage panic and anxiety. Therefore, a high score of 0.9 is appropriate for this category.\n\n'Meditation' is also relevant here, as the title and description refer to the practice as a 'guided meditation.' The channel's focus on self-help, mental health, and therapy further supports the inclusion of meditation as a secondary category. However, the central activity is breathing-focused, so a slightly lower score of 0.7 is assigned to meditation.\n\nOther workout categories were excluded due to a lack of physical activity focus, as the video targets mental well-being and calming techniques rather than physical exercise."
