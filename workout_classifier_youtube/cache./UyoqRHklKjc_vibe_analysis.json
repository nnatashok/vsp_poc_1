  "vibesExplanation": "The video title describes an 'Express Pilates Workout,' and the duration suggests a concentrated, effective session. The comment about the workout being 'tiny but mighty' and the callout to focus on breathing suggests a strong emphasis on technique and physical alignment, characteristics of 'The Masterclass Workout.' This merits a score of 0.79, indicating a strong match. \n\nThe description's mention of a 'dynamic and fast-paced' class hints at continuous movement, aligning with the 'The Rhythmic Powerhouse' vibe, which fits with music-driven momentum, resulting in a score of 0.65.\n\nAdditionally, user comments praising the workout's intensity and challenge indicate elements of 'The Disciplined Grind,' as participants focus on completing a tough but rewarding session. This results in a score of 0.6. While the workout is dynamic, the absence of competition or leaderboards excludes vibes like 'The Competitor.' Overall, I have high confidence in the selected vibes."
