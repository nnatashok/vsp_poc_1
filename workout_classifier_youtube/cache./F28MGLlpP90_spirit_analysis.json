  "spiritsExplanation": "The video '15 Minute Deep Breathing Exercise | City of Hope' clearly falls under the 'Soothing & Restorative' workout spirit. The title and description emphasize deep breathing exercises, which are known for their calming and stress-reducing benefits. The description mentions reducing anxiety, stress, and physical discomfort, which aligns with restorative practices. The tags, such as 'meditation' and 'living with cancer', reinforce this focus on healing and relaxation. The video is produced by City of Hope, a cancer research center, indicating an emphasis on recovery and support for individuals dealing with serious illnesses, further supporting the restorative nature. Comments from viewers mention relaxation and anxiety relief, confirming the soothing impact of the video. The strong match is evidenced by the clear, consistent messaging and target audience focus on stress reduction and well-being. Other spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' or 'Sport & Agility' are evidently not applicable due to the nature of deep breathing exercises."
