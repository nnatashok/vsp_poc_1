    "What I loved most about this is; you show exactly what muscles are being worked per move. It\u2019s very important to know where you should feel the work when lifting. I also love the   Fact the  timers are both visible and have sound. And I love you Jo! Thank you keep doing what you do .",
    "Today is February 13th. 2025. Starting weight 225. Goal is 140/150. Please like to keep me motivated and to check in. I completed the workout today and worked up a good sweat.
