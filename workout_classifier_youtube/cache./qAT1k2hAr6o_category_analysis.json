  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified primarily under 'Body weight' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is supported by the title '20-min BODYWEIGHT Full Body Workout' and repeated mentions in the description and tags that emphasize bodyweight exercises. Additionally, phrases such as 'build muscle and strength' and 'compound movements' indicate the bodyweight nature of the workout.\n\nThe 'HIIT' category is also relevant with a score of 0.6, as the description mentions the workout includes an 'element of cardio,' which aligns with high-intensity intervals. Furthermore, the channel description frequently references the combination of micro workouts with HIIT, although HIIT is not explicitly mentioned in the specific video description.\n\nThe comments provide further confirmation, with users highlighting the workout's intensity and its suitability for building strength without requiring weights. These factors collectively underscore a strong bodyweight workout with a HIIT component."
