  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is 'Yoga' with a high score of 0.95 due to explicit mentions in both the title and description, such as \"evening yoga flow\" and the channel's focus on yoga content. The description emphasizes yoga postures and sequences, confirming its central role in the video. \n\nSecondly, 'Stretching' is assigned with a score of 0.6. The description indicates elements of stretching as part of the yoga flow, mentioning a focus on preparing for a restful night's sleep through full-body postures and stretches, as supported by viewer comments about the practice involving specific stretches.\n\n'Meditation' receives a score of 0.3. The comments highlight the yoga's impact on calming nerves and promoting mindfulness, though the video doesn't focus solely on meditation techniques. Hence, it's a secondary aspect.\n\nOther categories are excluded as the content is clearly oriented around yoga and relaxation rather than aerobic exercise, intense cardio, or equipment-based workouts. The overall confidence for these categories is high due to consistent evidence across title, description, and channel focus."
