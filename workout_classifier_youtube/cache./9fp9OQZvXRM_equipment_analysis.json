  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The title and description emphasize a yoga flow, which commonly requires a mat for comfort during practice, providing stability and cushioning for poses. Additionally, comments reference using a mat: \"Yoga is meditation, which I think it often lost with online videos...when I come off the mat.\" This suggests participants are using a mat during the workout, leading to a very high confidence score (0.9) for mat use."
