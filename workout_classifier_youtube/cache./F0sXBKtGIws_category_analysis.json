  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is clearly categorized as a Yoga workout based on multiple strong indicators from the metadata. The title \"5 min Yoga Break: Reset & Find Calm\" explicitly mentions yoga, indicating that this is a brief yoga sequence. The description further supports this by detailing yoga poses such as leg extensions and reclined twists used to relieve tension and promote relaxation. Tags like \"yoga for stress relief,\" \"quick yoga routine,\" and \"yoga relaxation\" reinforce the focus on yoga. Given these factors, a high score of 0.9 is justified for the Yoga category, reflecting its central role in the video's content.\n\nThe inclusion of \"deep belly breathing\" in the description suggests an element of Breathing exercises, as this technique is known for its stress-relieving properties. While not the primary focus, breathing is present enough to warrant a moderate score of 0.5. This indicates its supportive but not central role in the workout. Other categories such as Stretching and Meditation were considered but not selected due to the primary emphasis on yoga poses and the lack of focused meditation practice or extensive stretching routines."
