  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video title and description clearly indicate that this 10-minute full body stretch routine is designed for flexibility, mobility, and relieving tight muscles. The most telling piece of metadata is the explicit statement in the description under the 'EQUIPMENT' section, stating: \"No equipment needed, just your bodyweight!\" This confirms that the workout is intended to be performed without any equipment, relying solely on bodyweight for the exercises. Moreover, although the presenter mentions using an oversized yoga mat, this is presented more as a personal choice than a necessity. Thus, while a mat could enhance comfort, it's not strictly required, and the workout is fundamentally a bodyweight routine."
