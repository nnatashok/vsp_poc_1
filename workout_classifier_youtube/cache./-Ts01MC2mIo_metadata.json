    "Hi, Adriene! I am an 81 year old woman. I have been doing your chair yoga routine for a few days. I find that when I&#39;m done I feel very relaxed. This routine is giving me more strength and allowing me to move better. I even breathe better. Thank you so much for this video, you have made a real difference in my life.",
    "I am 54, but my doctor recommended this chair yoga with Adrienne due to my numerous illnesses and sedentary lifestyle.  This shouldn&#39;t be called for seniors maybe newbies or easy yoga.  This is great in many ways!!!! Thank you.",
    "I&#39;m partnered via FB with a friend 2,000 miles distant. We&#39;re trying this program to challenge our sedentary life style. I&#39;m 87; she&#39;s in her late 70s. Will try to stay with the program!",
    "I had started yoga with Adriene during the Pandemic and my fight with cancer.  It helped with my physical and spiritual strength.  Thank you!",
    "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ts01MC2mIo&amp;t=1028\">17:08</a> <br>I\u2019m 67 and been following Adrien for years now . <br>This was the first chair yoga ever for me .  The arthritis in my hands makes  it super painful to do down dogs and flow when using hands for bearing weight  so painful. <br><br>I just loved this chair practice  and found that comfortable healthful feeling of breath and movement in equanimity .<br>Even on a Chair!<br>Thank you <br>Much gratitude"
