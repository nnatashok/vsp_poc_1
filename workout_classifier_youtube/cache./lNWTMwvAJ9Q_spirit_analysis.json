  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit identified is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high score of 0.9. This classification is supported by repeated emphasis on gentle, stress-relieving stretches and relaxation benefits in the description. Phrases like 'simple yet effective,' 'improve flexibility,' 'reduce stress,' and 'calm and focus' underline the restorative intent of the session. Moreover, multiple comments from viewers express how these sessions help them relax, manage back pain, and integrate seamlessly into morning routines, further validating this spirit.\n\nThe secondary spirit, 'Flow & Rhythm,' scores 0.6. This is due to the video's morning routine nature that promotes an energizing yet gentle flow to kickstart the day, evident in tags such as 'morning yoga' and '10 minute morning yoga.' Additionally, the channel's focus on yoga blends mind-body connection with rhythmic movement, consistent with 'Flow & Rhythm.' There's moderate confidence in this secondary spirit due to the description promoting a flow from one gentle stretch to another, suitable for all levels.\n\nOther spirits like 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'High-Energy & Intense' are excluded due to the indoor setting and the non-vigorous nature of this routine."
