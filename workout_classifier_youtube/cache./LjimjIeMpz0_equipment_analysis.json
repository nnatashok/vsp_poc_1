  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled \"20 min Full Body Dumbbell Workout\" explicitly mentions the use of dumbbells, which directly informs the requirement for this equipment. The description reinforces this by detailing a \"full body dumbbell workout\" designed to build muscle and strength, and references \"compound movements.\" Multiple tags such as \"full body dumbbell workout\" and \"dumbbell workout full body\" further support this, indicating that dumbbells are central to the workout's execution. The high frequency of 'dumbbell' in both title and tags justifies a confidence score of 1.0, meaning there is very high confidence that dumbbells are required for performing this workout."
