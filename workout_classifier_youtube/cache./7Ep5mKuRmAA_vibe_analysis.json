  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled 'Belly breathing exercise: Calming the body and mind' presented by the Indiana University School of Medicine is explicitly aimed at reducing stress and anxiety through a calming, simple, and widely accessible practice. The description highlights the video as a resource for stress relief, framing it as a calming practice, which strongly aligns with 'The Deep Recharge' vibe, focusing on nervous system reset and ultra-gentle movement, warranting a high score of 0.9.\n\nComments further emphasize the calming and anxiety-reducing effects, with viewers expressing significant relief from stress and anxiety attacks, suggesting a potential fit with 'The Sleep Prep' vibe. The comments mention a relaxing experience, vital for preparing the mind for rest, justifying a score of 0.7 as a secondary vibe.\n\nOverall, the primary goal of stress relief and anxiety reduction through a simple, non-intensive exercise in a slow-paced format points clearly to these vibes, and other potential vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Reboot Workout' are less suitable given the explicit focus on stress and anxiety management in a deep calming context."
