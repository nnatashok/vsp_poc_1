  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The required fitness level includes \"Beginner\", \"Intermediate\", and \"Advanced\", with the strongest emphasis on \"Beginner\". Meditation can be challenging for beginners due to the mental focus required, hence includes \"Intermediate\" and \"Advanced\" levels as well. Although technically simple and physically undemanding, meditation can require practice to master mental relaxation, so it can span multiple levels of 'fitness' in terms of mental discipline."
