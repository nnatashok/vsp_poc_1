  "vibesExplanation": "The video titled \"Enter a Deep Sleep while Connecting to your Higher Self (Guided Meditation)\" suggests a meditative and sleep-oriented focus, heavily supported by the description and tags like 'deep sleep', 'guided meditation', and 'sleep meditation'. The primary intent is clearly to guide viewers into a restful sleep while facilitating a deeper connection with one's higher self, indicating a perfect match for 'The Deep Recharge'. This vibe emphasizes ultra-gentle movement and a nervous system reset, directly aligned with the video content, meriting a score of 1.0.\n\nAdditionally, 'The Sleep Prep' is highly relevant due to the video\u2019s focus on preparation for restful sleep, supported by the duration and nature of the content. It\u2019s aimed at easing tension and preparing for rest, matching this vibe well with a score of 0.8. The section of the description about a 'restorative power of sleep' and comments from viewers who listen to it nightly confirm this alignment. Other vibes like 'The Zen Flow' or 'The Mindful Walk' are less applicable due to the specific intent for sleep and mental alignment, not general meditative flow or mindfulness in waking states."
