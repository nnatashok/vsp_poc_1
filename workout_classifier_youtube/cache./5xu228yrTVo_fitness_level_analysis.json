  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video utilizes basic bodyweight exercises such as planks, lunges, and calf raises which are generally considered beginner-friendly movements. These exercises require minimal coordination and balance, making them suitable for beginners. The mention of 'breaking it down into short, doable exercises' and the comment describing it as 'bodyweight exercise for beginners' reinforce this assessment. However, there is a slight intermediate element due to the inclusion of back exercises which might require slightly more coordination, hence the minor score for intermediate level.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "Considering the technique and effort difficulty, the workout is most suitable for beginners as it focuses on simple exercises and light effort, clearly shown in user comments appreciating its accessibility to those with minimal activity background. However, since it includes some full-body exercises and interval training, there is a mild alignment with intermediate levels for users who are transitioning from a completely sedentary lifestyle to being more active, as suggested by the mixed comments from beginners and those who walk regularly."
