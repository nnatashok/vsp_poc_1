  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video is centered around a full-body stretching routine aimed at improving flexibility and mobility. Stretching exercises generally involve simpler movements that focus on flexibility and range of motion, positioning them as Beginner in technique difficulty. The tags include 'stretching exercises for beginners,' indicating a focus on simpler techniques. However, some stretches might require awareness of breathing and form, placing a secondary emphasis on Intermediate technique difficulty for those less comfortable with flexibility work.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The combination of simple stretching techniques and the prolonged 35-minute session aligns well with a Beginner fitness level, offering ease for those new to exercise. However, the session's duration and potential for more advanced stretch variations introduce a light challenge, making it approachable yet slightly demanding, nudging toward Intermediate for those with some familiarity with exercise routines. The metadata, particularly the tags and description, strongly supports accessibility for beginners while allowing intermediate users who may need more extended focus on flexibility."
