  "comments": [
    "Your exercise routines are a work of art.  They are choreographed beautifully and your accompanying narrative is very precise and encouraging without being condescending.   Thank you for providing this type of excellence.",
    "This is such a sane calming workout. No constant hyperactive talking and a great controlled speed of exercises. Am really keen to follow this routine.",
    "I just want to thank you so much for your workouts.  I&#39;m 72 and was looking for someone that understood what the word senior meant.  You are a great teacher and you have helped me so much.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.",
    "Hi Lauren I previously left a comment for you after regularly doing your 10 minute video. Thanks for your reply. Here I am again. Since then I have been almost daily mixing and matching your videos. I am 74 years of age from London and so much enjoying your compilation of exercises that are so doable and effective. My strength and stature have improved a great deal thanks to your videos delivered in calm, encouraging and such empathic way. I just can\u2019t thank you enough. Feel so much better in myself",
    "Not only great for seniors, but also for people like me with chronic pain in my late 40\u2019s. Thank you for this!"
