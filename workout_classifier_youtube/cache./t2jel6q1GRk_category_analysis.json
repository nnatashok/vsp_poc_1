  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Stretching,' which is strongly supported by the video's title, which explicitly mentions 'Stretching Routine.' The description further reinforces this by detailing the purpose of the workout as a 'total-body stretching routine' aimed at improving flexibility and mobility. The tags such as 'morning stretching', 'stretching routine for flexibility', and 'full body stretch' further confirm the focus on stretching. Therefore, the 'Stretching' category is assigned a score of 0.95 to reflect its central role in the video.\n\nThe secondary category is 'Mat,' as the workout involves floor exercises without equipment, as indicated in the comments mentioning users 'just rolled off the bed and got on the floor.' This suggests general floor exercises typical of a 'Mat' classification. However, stretching is the dominant focus, so 'Mat' is given a lower score of 0.4 to reflect its minor presence compared to stretching. Other potential categories, such as Yoga or Pilates, are excluded due to the lack of evidence for any specific yoga postures or Pilates techniques."
