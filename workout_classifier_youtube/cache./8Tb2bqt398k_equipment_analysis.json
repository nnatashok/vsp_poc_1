  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video focuses on guided meditation for deep relaxation by Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. The title, description, tags, and comments emphasize meditation and relaxation rather than physical exercise. The description suggests that users should \"sit back, relax and follow Gurudev's instructions,\" indicating that the practice is likely a seated meditation session without the need for exercise equipment. There are no mentions of any fitness equipment like mats, dumbbells, or any other workout tools in the metadata. Therefore, it is highly likely that this session requires no equipment and is purely a mindfulness and mental relaxation exercise. Thus, the workout appears to be bodyweight only, requiring no physical fitness equipment."
