  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'High-Energy & Intense', strongly indicated by terms such as 'Cardio HIIT', 'fat burning', 'leave you sweating and energized', and the interval format '45s On/ 15s Rest', which suggests a fast-paced, heart-pumping session that promotes maximum effort. The popularity and viewer comments also provide a sense of the workout's challenging nature, with users reporting significant body changes and the need for perseverance, which align with intense workout qualities. Therefore, a high spirit match score of 0.9 is justified.\n\nThe workout also embodies 'Structured & Disciplined', as it follows a specific format (45 seconds exercise, 15 seconds rest), indicates a planned session with all-standing cardio and involves a timed interval setup. This aligns with structured protocols and technicality, meriting a score of 0.6. However, 'Soothing & Restorative', 'Flow & Rhythm', and other spirits are less applicable due to the absence of relaxation, recovery focus, or smooth movement emphasis."
