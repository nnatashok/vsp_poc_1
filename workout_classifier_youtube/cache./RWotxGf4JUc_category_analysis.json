  "categoriesConfidence": 0.9,
  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category chosen is 'Yoga' with a high confidence score of 0.9, as the video is explicitly titled \"15 Min Yoga for Men: Full Body Morning Stretch - Morning Yoga Flow.\" The tags and description emphasize yoga-specific terms such as 'yoga for men,' 'power yoga,' 'morning yoga flow,' and 'yoga for athletes.' These are strong indicators that the main focus of the workout is yoga. Additionally, the channel is known for yoga and Pilates content, reinforcing the emphasis on yoga.\n\nThe secondary category, 'Stretching,' is rated with a score of 0.6. This is because the description mentions a 'full-body morning stretch' and 'enhancing flexibility,' suggesting a focus on stretching within the yoga routine. Comments such as \"that pigeon stretch at the end was dynamite!\" support this inclusion. However, since the overwhelming theme is yoga, the stretching aspect is secondary.\n\nOther categories like 'Pilates' and 'Body weight' were considered but excluded as there is no explicit mention in the metadata, and the primary emphasis is clearly on a yoga routine."
