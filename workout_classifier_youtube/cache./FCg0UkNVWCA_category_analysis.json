  "categoriesExplanation": "The video clearly focuses on a stretching routine as evidenced by both explicit language and implicit content indicators. The title '15 MIN DEEP FULL BODY STRETCH' and repeated emphasis on 'stretch', 'flexibility', and 'mobility' in the tags and description underscore stretch-focused exercise, justifying a score of 0.95 for the Stretching category. The channel's usual content includes HIIT and strength workouts, suggesting a potential connection to recovery, as indicated by 'recovery workout' and 'help your body recover' in the description. Since 'recovery' is a minor theme secondary to stretching, it received a low score in the Other category. The alignment with 'mobility session', 'improve flexibility', and user comments praising flexibility support stretching as the primary category with very high confidence, while potential ambiguity in identifying the 'recovery' aspect earns a minor classification in Other."
