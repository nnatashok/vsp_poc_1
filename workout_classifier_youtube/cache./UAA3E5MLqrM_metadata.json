  "description": "Simple stretches like these can often help provide relief from stress & anxiety because gentle stretching can help the body relax. These seated stretches are performed in real time so it's easy to follow along. More full body stretches: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJAHGpe0AVU\n\nThis relaxing stretching routine starts with a gentle warm up. Knee extensions or long arc quads (LAQ), hip flexion, and upper arm jumping jacks and horizontal Ts will help get your muscles warm and ready to stretch.\r\r\n\nTo start off with the neck area where we hold a lot of our stress, upper trapezius and levator scapulae stretches are great to help relax those muscles.\r\r\n\nScapular squeezes, seated trunk rotation, and quadratus lumborum (QL) stretches will help work the upper, middle, and low back.\r\r\n\nMoving down to the hips and legs, a seated knee to chest, seated hamstring stretch, and an active calf stretch will help relax the lower body.\n\nRelated Videos:\r\r\n\nShoulder Pain Relief Stretches \u2013 5 Minute Real Time Routine:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jHsraw2NIk\n\nBack Pain Relief Stretches \u2013 5 Minute Real Time Routine:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYMmtEFhuxA\n\n===========================================\n\n\r\rDr. Jo is a licensed Physical Therapist and Doctor of Physical Therapy.\r\r\n\nSUPPORT Ask Doctor Jo on Patreon for as little as $1 a month, and get cool rewards: http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo\n\n\r\r===========================================\n\n\r\rRelaxing Full Body Stretching Routine for Stress & Anxiety Relief, Seated:\n\rhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAA3E5MLqrM\nhttps://www.askdoctorjo.com/full-body-stretch-seated\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.
