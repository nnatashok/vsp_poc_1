  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is designed for treadmill running, as explicitly mentioned in the title \"Virtual Running Videos For Treadmill With Music | Virtual Run Mountain\" and reiterated in the tags like \"treadmill running videos\" and \"videos to watch while running on treadmill\". The description and channel information also reference treadmill workouts. Although some viewers in the comments suggested alternatives to using a treadmill, such as walking in place, the primary equipment needed to perform the workout as intended is clearly a treadmill, hence a very high confidence score of 0.9 is assigned."
