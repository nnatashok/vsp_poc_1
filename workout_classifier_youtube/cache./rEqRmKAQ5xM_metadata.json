    "Being an introvert, I don&#39;t like being in crowded places so I prefer to do exercises at home. My brother and I bought a stationary bike last year, I just started using it last month with your beginner videos as my guide. This one is my favorite because it&#39;s all about the saddle. Thank you, Kaleigh, for sharing your knowledge. Your videos has helped me find the best workout for myself. I wake up at 5:30am every workweek to do this workout and have just decided to have &quot;dessert&quot; starting tomorrow. I have depression so I have to workout to help with my mental health. Thank you once again. Sending much love and support from the Philippines. &lt;3",
    "Stationary bike. You are helping save my Dad and I want to sincerely thank you for posting this. I used to always be in great shape from high school up until I was about 35. The past 5 years I fell out of working out and eating right. My Dad was diagnosed with hemochromatosis this past year and needs a liver transplant. I changed my diet completely, have been hitting the gym hard and running on a treadmill to be sure I\u2019m eligible to donate part of my liver for him. Running is hard because of knee injuries in football. Cycling seems to be easier on my knees and your videos was perfect to start this journey. Anyone reading this comment, I\u2019m asking for prayers that I get in the shape I need to donate and my Dad is able to get the transplant he needs. No need to reply, just pray \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",
    "A beginner\u2019s workout that\u2019s actually for beginners and doesn\u2019t involve standing up every 2 minutes - perfect! Just what I needed. Thanks for putting this up."
