  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified primarily as 'Structured & Disciplined' with a score of 0.8. This is evident from the title and description, which mention '10 Exercises for Strength & Balance,' indicating a methodical approach focusing on compound movements that target different body areas. The use of dumbbells and phrases like 'strength building,' 'muscle building,' and 'beginner strength exercises' further reinforce this structured methodology. The tags and channel content also emphasize structure and precision targeted at seniors, underscoring the structured nature of the workout.\n\nThe 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit is also relevant, assigned a score of 0.6, due to the focus on balance and osteoporosis-friendly exercises tailored for seniors, promoting gentle engagement rather than intense effort. Comments mentioning improvements in balance and accessibility for older adults suggest a restorative, supportive environment foundational to the workout's design.\n\nOther spirits like 'High-Energy & Intense' and 'Sport & Agility' are not considered matches due to the low-impact, senior-friendly nature of the workout. There is no indication of outdoor elements or athletic sports training, ruling out 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Sport & Agility' as well."
