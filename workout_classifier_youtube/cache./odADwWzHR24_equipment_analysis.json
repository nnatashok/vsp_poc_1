  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video titled 'Relieve Stress & Anxiety with Simple Breathing Techniques' by AskDoctorJo is focused entirely on breathing exercises aimed at alleviating stress and anxiety. The title, description, and tags all emphasize breathing techniques alone, such as Square breathing and Pursed breathing, which do not require any physical equipment. The metadata and user comments also provide no indication of any physical activity or exercise that would typically involve equipment. As such, the workout described appears to be bodyweight only, involving no equipment other than one's own breath and body, which is common for breathing exercises or meditation-focused workouts."
