  "vibesExplanation": "This workout leans heavily toward 'The Reboot Workout' vibe due to its focus on a gentle, full-body stretch routine aimed at stress and anxiety relief, as emphasized in the title and reiterated in the description. The use of terms like 'relaxing', 'gentle', and 'seated stretching' indicates a slow, calming experience designed to refresh the body with minimal stress, characteristic of a Reboot. The second prominent vibe is 'The Deep Recharge', evidenced by the video's emphasis on stress and anxiety relief through calming stretches. This aligns with the soothing and restorative nature typical of a Deep Recharge workout. Both of these vibes are highly supported by the metadata, including the relaxed pacing inferred from the description and common viewer appreciation for low-intensity, seated, therapeutic exercises. Other potential vibes related to more dynamic or intense workouts were excluded due to the lack of relevant keywords and the seated, calming nature of the routine."
