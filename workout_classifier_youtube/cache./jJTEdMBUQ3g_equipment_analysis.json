  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video description explicitly states that a mat or a soft surface is needed for the workout, providing a high confidence that a mat is integral. The suggestion of 'mat or soft surface' strongly implies the necessity for some kind of cushioning for floor exercises, which is typical in prenatal workouts to accommodate comfort and safety. The description even includes a link to a specific mat, further indicating that using a mat is a central part of the exercise setup. No other equipment is mentioned in the video metadata, comments, or tags, suggesting that the workout focuses on bodyweight exercises with the primary support being a mat."
