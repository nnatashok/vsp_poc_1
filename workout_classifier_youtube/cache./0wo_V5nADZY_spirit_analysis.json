  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified under 'High-Energy & Intense' with a score of 0.95 because it is a HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) session, which inherently involves fast-paced and vigorous exercise designed to maximize effort and calorie burn. This is supported by metadata such as the title ('30 Minute Full Body HIIT Workout at Home with Weights') and tags (e.g., 'hiit workout for fat loss', 'dumbbell hiit workout'), all indicating a high-intensity focus. Additionally, user comments like 'suffer and relax' and reviewing the effort required also align with this spirit. \n\nStructured & Disciplined spirit is also relevant with a score of 0.7, due to the use of structured protocols indicated by the inclusion of a warm-up and cool down, and the specific time duration (30 minutes) mentioned in the title. The HASfit channel's emphasis on methodical exercise plans and disciplined routines further supports this classification. Other spirits like 'Flow & Rhythm' or 'Soothing & Restorative' were excluded due to the lack of elements related to smooth, gentle, or restorative movement patterns."
