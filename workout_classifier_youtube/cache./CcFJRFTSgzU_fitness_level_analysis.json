  "techniqueDifficultyExplanation": "The video introduces breathing exercises described as 'beginner's pace,' suggesting simple techniques suitable for beginners. However, the mention of 'breath holds' up to 2 minutes implies some level of intermediate skill, as prolonged breath retention can require some practice and control, particularly for breath control and mindfulness. Comments describing the experience as 'intense' and 'scary during the long pause' further support a mildly more complex technique assessment, but the primary focus remains beginner-friendly due to the straightforward nature of the breathing exercises.",

  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "The duration is relatively long (21:30), but since it's a breathing exercise focused on relaxation rather than physical exertion, the energy expenditure is light. The classification of 'light' is supported by the nature of the exercise being primarily breathing and meditation, which doesn't require significant caloric energy. The option to extend breath holds and gradual increase implies a potential for moderate effort for those pushing boundaries, reflected in some comments.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "The technique is simple and intended for beginners, with a small level of intermediate insight due to increasing breath hold challenges. Since the exercise can be paused, and it emphasizes safety ('if you feel the urge to breathe, go ahead'), it's predominantly suitable for beginners. Breathing exercises are accessible for nearly all fitness levels, but the progressive challenge allows some to align it with intermediate fitness seekers. Thus, the primary level remains 'Beginner,' with an additional 'Intermediate' for nuances and potential adjustments by viewers aiming for increased mastery."
