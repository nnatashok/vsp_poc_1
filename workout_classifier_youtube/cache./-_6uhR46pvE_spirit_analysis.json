  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout is classified as predominantly 'Flow & Rhythm' (0.75) due to its emphasis on continuous movement and the former dancer background of the instructor, which is highlighted in both the channel and metadata. The title includes 'Power Pilates for Energy', suggesting a dynamic element further supported by descriptions of a 'faster paced class'. This aligns with 'Flow & Rhythm'. The tag 'express' implies a focused and efficiently structured session, indicating 'Structured & Disciplined' (0.65) as it suggests a concise, goal-oriented workout. While not specifically methodical like a heavier protocol, Pilates inherently involves precise movements and alignment, lending to this classification. Additionally, 'High-Energy & Intense' (0.4) is appropriate because the workout is described as 'perfect for when you are short on time but still want to sweat and feel energised'. This, along with comments describing it as a 'killer for only 20 minutes', suggests intensity, although it's sub-maximal compared to more intense modalities. The spirit 'Sport & Agility' and 'Outdoor & Adventure' are less relevant due to the indoor, form-focused nature, while 'Soothing & Restorative' is unsuitable as the workout aims to energize rather than relax."
