  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is primarily classified as 'Pilates' (score: 0.9) due to the explicit mention in the title ('Pilates Arm Workout') and description. The channel Club Forme Pilates & Barre is focused on Pilates content, reinforcing this classification. Additionally, the description highlights Pilates-themed instructions such as controlled movements to simulate resistance. The 'Weight workout' category is applicable (score: 0.7) because the workout involves light weights, as cited in the title ('with Light Weights') and repeatedly throughout the description and tags ('arms workout with light weights'). The option to use body weight instead of weights justifies including 'Body weight' but with a lower score of 0.4, since the primary focus is on weights. Comments reflect the intensity and effectiveness of the workout, matching the expected experience of Pilates with light weights. Since the video does not involve traditional weightlifting, more intense HIIT, or other categories focused on different exercises, these were excluded."
