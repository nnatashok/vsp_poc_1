  "spiritsExplanation": "The workout metadata strongly suggests a 'Flow & Rhythm' spirit, primarily driven by the Pilates nature of the session. The title and description emphasize a 'full body workout' and participants feeling 'strong, energised and more centred,' indicating a focus on continuous movement and coordination consistent with Pilates ('a passion for movement'). The description mentions no equipment and suggests a mat-based session, typical of bodyweight flow workouts designed to enhance mind-body connection. The user comments support this, praising technique, music, and coaching style, which contribute to a rhythmic and flowing experience. Furthermore, the channel's background in dancing and passion for movement also align with Flow & Rhythm. The 'Structured & Disciplined' spirit is evident due to Pilates\u2019s methodical nature, requiring technical precision and discipline. However, the high-energy, intense, or adventure elements are absent, explaining the exclusion of other spirits. Given the explicit focus and supportive evidence, the scoring reflects high confidence in these spirits."
