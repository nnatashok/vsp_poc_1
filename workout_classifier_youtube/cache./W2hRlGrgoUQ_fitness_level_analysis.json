  "effortDifficultyExplanation": "This routine is only 10 minutes long, focusing on gentle stretches which inherently implies a low level of physical demand and short duration, aligning it with a light effort difficulty. However, the act of stretching itself can sometimes feel moderately challenging, especially for individuals with very little current activity, so there is a slight moderate effort rating as well. Comments describe the routine as perfect for starting one's day or loosening up, supporting the light effort classification.",

  "requiredFitnessLevelExplanation": "This yoga routine is explicitly designed for beginners, as stated in the title and description. It involves simple stretches that can be done in bed or on a mat, ideal for those new to physical activity. Despite being targeted at beginners, some stretches might slightly challenge those with minimal movement experience, which justifies a minor score for the intermediate level to accommodate variability in baseline fitness levels. The recurring emphasis on beginners in user comments also supports this classification."
