  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is clearly categorized under 'Breathing exercises' due to the consistent mention of 'breathing', 'breathwork', and 'breathing techniques' across the title, description, and tags. The title, '10 Minute Morning Breathwork Routine I The Key To Happiness,' explicitly states that this is a breathing routine, supported by tags such as 'breathing exercises' and 'guided breathwork.' Additionally, the description emphasizes starting the morning with a calm breathing technique and mentions potential benefits such as reduced stress and increased positivity, which align with the goals of breathwork.\n\n'Meditation' is a secondary but relevant category, given the focus on using breath to induce a state of 'relaxation and bliss' and recommendations to facilitate an 'enhanced experience'. The presence of tags like 'guided breathwork meditation' and 'morning meditation' supports this categorization as it alludes to elements that overlap with meditative practices. The overall language in the description and comments about finding peace and clarity through breathwork further supports this connection.\n\nThe channel's focus on guided exercises leveraging rhythmic music and uplifting outcomes strengthens the categorization. Other potential categories such as 'Yoga' or 'Stretching' were excluded due to the absence of explicit references to physical postures or flexibility work in the metadata."
