  "categoriesExplanation": "The video is classified under 'Body weight' and 'Mat' exercises due to the evident focus on core and abdominal movements performed without equipment. The tags such as \"abs workout\", \"core workout\", and \"bodyweight\" emphasize bodyweight exercises. The description specifies that no equipment is needed, which implies body weight resistance. Specific movements listed like \"plank twist,\" \"dead bug,\" and \"crunch\" are classic bodyweight exercises targeting the core. The description encourages using a mat for the exercise routine, indicating floor-based exercises typical of 'Mat' workouts. Additionally, user comments and tags consistently focus on the effectiveness of the abs workout, further supporting the selected categories. The absence of other equipment-based exercises or movement types, like weights or machines, excludes categories such as 'Weight workout' or 'HIIT'. The scoring reflects very strong evidence of bodyweight-focused exercise with 'Mat' exercises being slightly less emphasized but still present."
