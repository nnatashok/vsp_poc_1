  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The metadata, including the title, description, and tags, suggests that the workout is designed for pregnant women and focuses on exercises for health, fitness, and easy delivery. The description mentions a variety of exercises such as cardio, hip openers, pelvic floor, and core work, which indicates a broad range of activities suitable for pregnancy. However, there is no specific mention of any equipment being required for these exercises. The comment about hardwood floors and the need to ease pain from the knees and hands suggests that a mat could be beneficial, but it's not indicated as essential equipment. Since the video aims to be inclusive for pregnant women at various stages, it is likely designed to be performed with bodyweight only, hence no specific equipment is needed. This accounts for the decision to report an empty array for requiredEquipment, indicating a bodyweight-only workout."
