  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is a 40-minute Cardio Pilates class, which typically involves movements performed on the floor. The description explicitly mentions a mat, with a discount provided for purchasing one from Liforme, strongly suggesting that a mat is required for the workout. Moreover, the channel is focused on Pilates, which often uses a mat for exercises. This explicit mention and the nature of Pilates provide very high confidence (0.9) that a mat is needed for this workout. No other equipment is mentioned or implied in the metadata, indicating that the workout focuses on bodyweight exercises, typical of many Pilates routines."
