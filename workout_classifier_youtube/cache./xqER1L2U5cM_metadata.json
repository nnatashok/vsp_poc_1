    "I wept after this workout because I was able to finish it (with some modifications) in spite of being on chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer. Every little victory counts, praise be to the Lord! And also thank you Jo for what you do \u2764",
    "2 years later I want you to know I am down 150 pounds and you were who got me to start working out. I love you!",
    "I wasn\u2019t in the mood to exercise today, but I decided to find a quick 15-minute workout. This was the first one that popped up and it caught my interest. I only planned to do the first 15 minutes but once I started, the music and Jo\u2019s smile kept me going, especially knowing she\u2019s pregnant. I thought if Jo can do this, so can I. I skipped the weights and ran in place instead. Thank you so much for your workouts. They have truly transformed my life. May God continue to bless you and cover you! \u2764",
    "I love this 7 in 1 Workout! Please do more videos like this! It is so easy to stay motivated when the workout style changes so often in one workout. I&#39;ve been working out with you since last may and i have never before stayed consistend with any other workout routine. I love your videos and the positivity you radiate! Thank you Jo!",
    "I love that you&#39;re doing a new video every Saturday!!! Thank you!"
