  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Soothing & Restorative,' with a score of 0.9. This classification is strongly supported by the video's emphasis on relaxation, stress relief, and anxiety reduction, as highlighted in the title 'Box Breathing Exercise | TAKE A DEEP BREATH | Pranayama Series.' Tags such as 'relaxation technique,' 'guided meditation,' and 'stress relief' reinforce this spirit. Furthermore, the comments from users experiencing calm and mental peace further validate this classification. \n\nThe secondary spirit 'Flow & Rhythm' scores 0.6. This is inferred from the structured breathing pattern (box breathing) and the rhythm implied in terms like 'mindful' and 'meditation,' promoting a mind-body connection. The description mentions smooth, rhythmic breathing essential for the method described. \n\nThere's no indication of high intensity, sports-specific, or outdoor elements, making other spirits irrelevant for this classification."
