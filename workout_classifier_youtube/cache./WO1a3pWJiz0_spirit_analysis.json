  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit identified is 'Soothing & Restorative' with a high confidence score of 0.9. The emphasis on relieving lower back pain through gentle core strengthening aligns strongly with the 'Soothing & Restorative' spirit. The title, description, and user comments highlight pain relief and healing, indicating a focus on recovery and well-being. Phrases such as 'lower back pain relief' and 'eliminate pain' emphasize a restorative approach.\n\nA secondary spirit, 'Structured & Disciplined', is also present with a moderate score of 0.7. The workout follows a clear, methodical routine with specified exercises (e.g., Single Leg Bridge, Bird Dog, Plank) intended to systematically strengthen the core, which is a hallmark of this spirit. The presence of a structured regimen designed by a physical therapist suggests a disciplined approach.\n\n'High-Energy & Intense' and other spirits are not applicable as the video is low-impact and focused on gentle rehabilitation rather than high-intensity training or sports-specific skills."
