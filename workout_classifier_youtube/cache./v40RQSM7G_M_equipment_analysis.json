  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is explicitly centered around the use of an elliptical, as indicated in both the title \"HIIT Elliptical Forward/Backwards Intervals: Low Impact Cross Trainer Workout\" and repeatedly in the description. The tags also consistently mention 'elliptical workout,' 'elliptical trainer,' and 'elliptical machine,' further reinforcing the focus on this equipment. Additionally, the description outlines the workout structure specifically for an elliptical, with details on incline and resistance, which are features specific to elliptical machines. Consequently, the confidence level for requiring an elliptical is 1.0, as it is the core piece of equipment for this workout."
