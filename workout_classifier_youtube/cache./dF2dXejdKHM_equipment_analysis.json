  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled '20 MIN PILATES CORE & ABS WORKOUT || At-Home Pilates For All Levels' and its accompanying description strongly indicate the use of a mat. The description includes a specific mention of a 'Mat from Liforme' with a link and discount code provided, which suggests that a mat is essential for performing the exercises comfortably and effectively. Additionally, the focus on Pilates in the title and tags implies floor exercises typical of Pilates routines, which are best performed on a mat. Therefore, I am very confident (0.8) that a mat is required for this workout."
