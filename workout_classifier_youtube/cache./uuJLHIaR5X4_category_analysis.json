  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category is 'Elliptical' with a high confidence score of 0.9. This is evident from multiple references in the metadata: the title ('10 Minute HIIT Express Elliptical Workout'), tags ('elliptical workout', 'elliptical hiit workout for fat loss'), and description explicitly mention the use of an elliptical machine. The specific mention of starting the workout with 'Hop on your elliptical or cardio climber' further solidifies the involvement of the elliptical.\n\nThe secondary category is 'HIIT' with a score of 0.85. The title includes 'HIIT', indicating a High-Intensity Interval Training format. The description elaborates on 'constantly changing intervals designed to push your body to the max', characteristic of HIIT. The workout structure described (e.g., 'Pyramid Style Sprints') corroborates this with its focus on alternating high-intensity efforts and rest periods.\n\nBoth categories are emphasized in the metadata, and the overlap between elliptical and HIIT exercises in this video is clear, as reflected in the scores. No other categories appear pertinent due to the specificity of the equipment and training style discussed."
