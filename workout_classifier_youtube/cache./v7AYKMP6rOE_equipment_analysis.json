  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The video is titled \"Yoga For Complete Beginners - 20 Minute Home Yoga Workout!\", which explicitly indicates that this is a yoga workout intended for beginners. The description further advises viewers to \"Hop on the mat and start to build the foundation of your own yoga practice,\" specifically mentioning a mat as integral to the practice. In typical yoga sessions, a mat is almost always used to provide cushioning and support during poses. The tags also frequently reference beginner yoga, implying that a minimal amount of equipment is needed, most typically a mat. There is no mention of other equipment like blocks or straps, which could be optional, but the central piece of equipment explicitly mentioned and vital to this workout is a mat, justifying a very high confidence score of 0.8."
