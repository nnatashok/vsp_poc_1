  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video titled '10 MINUTE MORNING WORKOUT (NO EQUIPMENT)' clearly indicates that no equipment is needed. This is reinforced by tags such as 'no equipment,' 'bodyweight,' and 'no weight.' The description reiterates that the full body workout can be done without any equipment or weights, making it clear that all exercises are performed using only bodyweight. Exercises mentioned, such as jumping jacks, bodyweight squats, push-ups, and planks, are all typical of bodyweight routines that do not require additional equipment. Therefore, based on the metadata, this workout appears to be a bodyweight-only routine."
