  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout is explicitly titled \"15-Minute Walk-Run Intervals | Follow Along Treadmill Workout!\" indicating that a treadmill is essential to perform this workout. The description reinforces this with phrases like \"15-minute treadmill walk-run workout,\" \"intervals,\" and \"Hit play, follow along,\" implying that the workout is designed to be performed while on a treadmill. Tags such as \"treadmill follow along workout,\" \"treadmill running routine,\" and \"treadmill workout\" further confirm the necessity of a treadmill. Therefore, I am highly confident (1.0) that a treadmill is required for this workout."
