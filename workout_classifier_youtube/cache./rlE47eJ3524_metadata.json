  "description": "Join me for this 20-minute beginner yoga routine, designed to help you ease into your practice and build a strong foundation. Each pose is held for 3-5 breaths, giving you time to settle into your body, feel the stretch, and enjoy the flow. We'll be using two yoga blocks throughout the class to support your alignment and increase flexibility. If you don\u2019t have yoga blocks, no worries! You can use books or water bottles as an alternative. Whether you're brand new to yoga or looking to refine your practice, this session is perfect for you!\n\nGrab your mat and two blocks, and let's get started on this gentle, relaxing routine!\n\nIf you enjoyed flowing with me and want to see more videos like this, please like, comment, and share with friends and family! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\n\nThank you for choosing to flow with me! \ud83e\udd0d\n\nWith love and gratitude, \n\nAudrey \n\n#beginneryogapractice #beginneryoga #yogaforbeginners #20minuteyoga #yogaroutine \n\n============================================================\n\nLet's stay connected! \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/evol.vyoga\n\nWebsite: https://www.evolvyoga.ch\n\nEVOLV Yoga Space: https://www.evolvyoga.ch/evolv-yoga-space\n\n============================================================\n\nDisclaimer: We do not accept any liability for any loss or damage incurred from you acting or not acting as a result of watching any of my publications.
