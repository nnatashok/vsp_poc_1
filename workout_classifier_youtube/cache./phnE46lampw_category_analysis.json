  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category assigned is 'Stretching' with a high confidence score of 1.0. This classification is based on the video's title, '15 Min Full Body Daily Stretch for Tight Muscles, Soreness & Flexibility,' which clearly indicates a focus on stretching exercises. The tags such as 'daily stretch,' 'deep stretch,' and 'stretching exercises for beginners' further support this categorization. The description emphasizes the benefits of stretching for recovery, flexibility, and mobility, reinforcing that stretching is the central workout theme. Additionally, user comments highlight the video as a daily stretching routine, cementing its primary classification.\n\nA secondary category of 'Breathing exercises' is also noted with a score of 0.4, indicating a moderate presence. The description suggests focusing on deep breathing during stretches, which implies a mild emphasis on controlled breathing techniques. However, as breathing exercises are not the core focus, the score is moderate, reflecting its supplementary role in the workout."
