  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category selected is 'Indoor biking' with a very high confidence level of 1.0. This is explicitly supported by the video title, 'Saturday Sweat Session | 45 Min Rhythm Ride Indoor Cycling Workout,' and multiple references throughout the description such as 'rhythm ride indoor cycling' and 'get these pedals spinning.' The channel, Kaleigh Cohen Cycling, specializes in cycling workouts, as indicated in both the channel description and the tags provided, such as 'indoor cycling workout,' 'spin class,' and 'stationary bike.' The viewer comments further support that this is a cycling session, describing the experience as a 'class' and 'riding.' The secondary category 'Other' was considered with a low score of 0.2 due to the general fitness enthusiasm and potential inclusion of non-cycling motivational content but is not a central focus. No other categories such as 'HIIT' or 'Weight workout' were included, as they are not supported by the metadata."
