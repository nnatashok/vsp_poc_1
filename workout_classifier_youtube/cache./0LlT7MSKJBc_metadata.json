    "I feel the prettiest when i sweat and look like a tomato, because i feel so strong and healthy haha. Proud of myself for doing this work out 2 times in a row:)",
    "I love that there\u2019s no toxic pep talks mid-workout with these like \u201coh do this so you can eat the snack you want later!!\u201d Or \u201cit\u2019s not working if you\u2019re not hurting\u201d Instead, she wants us to challenge ourselves while listening to our bodies, for whatever purpose we want to be working out. I appreciate that so much.",
    "I love how she doesn&#39;t talk much about it and just gets straight to the workout",
    "your editing skills are so fire girl, love the choices you made with the timer, visual look, positioning, and featuring the upcoming moves within the timer!! no other home workout video can compare. haven&#39;t seen such level of viewer-centred content creation from anyone else than from you. ily, keep doing you, will try this out asap \u2661"
