    "Thanks so much for this wonderful routine.  Not too fast, not too slow, just right!  25 minutes went by really fast.",
    "Girls! As a very physically limited young person this has become my dearest and most favourite workout of all time. It\u2019s strengthening my muscles but releasing my tendons and chronically convulsed body. I\u2019m struggling with my knees, shoulders etc. a lot and I\u2019ve been doing this workout about 1-3x a week and I\u2019m already seeing results in my physical feeling. Thanks a lot and great work!!!!",

    "Just finished this after a night shift and I feel so relaxed now. Time for tea and then bed. Thank you!!!"
