  "spiritsExplanation": "The primary spirit of this workout is 'Flow & Rhythm' (0.8) due to its focus on Vinyasa Yoga, as indicated by the tags and channel description emphasizing 'smooth, continuous movement patterns' and 'music-driven pacing'. The consistent breathing focus mentioned in the description ('...stay focused on your breath') supports this. The spirit 'Soothing & Restorative' (0.7) is also evident, as the video is described as beneficial for stress and anxiety relief and encourages relaxation (\"...to alleviate stress and anxiety\"), further supported by user comments praising the gentle and accepting energy of the instructor. Lastly, 'Structured & Disciplined' (0.5) is apparent given the focus on building foundational strength, balance, and flexibility, which implies methodical progression despite being a beginner class. The detailed instruction style noted in comments emphasizes technical precision often indicative of this spirit. Other spirits such as 'High-Energy & Intense' are excluded due to a lack of indicators for maximum effort or intensity in the workout."
