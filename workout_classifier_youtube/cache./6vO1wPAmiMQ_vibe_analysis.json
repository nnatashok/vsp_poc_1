  "vibesExplanation": "This workout video is primarily a guided meditation for anxiety and stress, focusing on a calm, restful experience. \"The Deep Recharge\" is a strong match, as the video is aimed at providing a nervous system reset and involves ultra-gentle movement through guided imagery and visualization, which is confirmed by the title and description emphasizing 'peaceful meditations,' 'unlock peace, healing' and helping with stress. The comments further support this, highlighting emotional relief and life-changing impact. \n\n\"The Zen Flow\" is also relevant due to the grounding, intentional, and breath-centered nature of meditation, as evidenced by the tags and overall channel focus on meditation, relaxation, and zen music, contributing to a high confidence for this classification. \n\nAdditionally, \"The Reboot Workout\" fits moderately, with elements of total-body refresh suggested by the use of guided visualization to relieve stress and anxiety. This video essentially offers a mental 'reboot,' though it is less directly aligned with physical recovery such as stretching or mobility, hence a moderate score. The overall high confidence reflects clear indicators from metadata pointing to these vibes."
