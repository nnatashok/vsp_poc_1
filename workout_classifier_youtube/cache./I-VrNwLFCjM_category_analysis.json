  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout video is 'Pilates,' with a high confidence level of 0.95, due to several strong indicators in the metadata. The title explicitly mentions 'Pilates Full Body Workout,' and the tags are heavily focused on Pilates-related terms like 'best pilates,' 'effective pilates,' and 'pilates for beginners.' The description also reinforces this as a Pilates workout that targets the entire body. Additionally, user comments frequently refer to the Pilates nature of the workout and praise its effectiveness.\n\nA secondary category of 'Mat' is also relevant, with a score of 0.7. The description notes that no equipment is needed beyond a mat, suggesting floor-based exercises typical of mat workouts. However, this is less dominant due to the stronger emphasis and branding as a Pilates-focused session.\n\nOther potential categories, such as 'Yoga' and 'Body weight,' were considered due to the channel's overall focus on yoga and the equipment-free nature of the workout, but the explicit focus on Pilates led to their exclusion as primary categories."
