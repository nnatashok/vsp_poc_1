  "spiritsExplanation": "The main workout spirits identified from the video metadata are 'Structured & Disciplined' and 'Sport & Agility,' with a secondary presence of 'High-Energy & Intense.' The title explicitly mentions 'Exercises To Improve Your Running,' suggesting a targeted, structured approach to enhance running performance. This is supported by the description, which references expert guidance and a methodical exercise list including squats, planks, and jumps specifically for runners, indicating disciplined, protocol-focused training (score: 0.8).\n\nThe spirit of 'Sport & Agility' (score: 0.7) is evidenced by tags such as 'running,' 'training,' and 'exercises for runners,' clearly emphasizing agility and sport-specific development. The exercises listed, like squat jumps and lunge jumps, are designed to enhance athletic performance and running efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, some elements of 'High-Energy & Intense' (score: 0.5) are present due to the inclusion of dynamic exercises like jump squats and lunge jumps, which often involve higher intensity.\n\nThe absence of nature or relaxation elements excludes 'Outdoor & Adventure' and 'Soothing & Restorative' spirits from consideration. Flow elements are minimal, hence 'Flow & Rhythm' is excluded. The combination of structured guidance and sport-specificity provides the primary classification framework."
