  "categoriesExplanation": "The primary category for this workout is 'Calisthenics,' with very high confidence (score: 1.0). This classification is supported by multiple explicit mentions of calisthenics throughout the metadata. The title includes 'Calisthenics Workout,' and the description emphasizes the use of calisthenics exercises. Tags such as 'calisthenics workout,' 'full body calisthenics,' and 'calisthenics training' further corroborate this category.\n\nAdditionally, 'Body weight' is another relevant category, with a moderate to high presence (score: 0.7). The description notably highlights the workout as a 'no equipment full body bodyweight workout,' which implies exercises using only the individual's body weight. However, the stronger emphasis on the specific calisthenics method justifies giving it the primary focus.\n\nThe high number of views and positive user comments from those new to calisthenics, like 'Perfect for beginners,' indicate that this workout effectively introduces and employs principles central to calisthenics training. No other categories fit as well, given the lack of equipment and explicit focus on calisthenics."
