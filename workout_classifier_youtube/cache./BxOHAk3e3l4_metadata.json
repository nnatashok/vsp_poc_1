  "title": "10 Minute Full Body Stretch & Mobility: (For Daily Routine or Pre/Post Workout)",
  "description": "In this video, we\u2019re taking you through a quick full body stretch routine that you can do daily to improve your mobility and flexibility. This all around stretch targets the big muscle groups and common tight areas that most people experience. You can do this anywhere and can even be useful before and after your workouts. This routine is also semi-dynamic so that you can ease your way into a deeper stretch without any strain. We recommend doing a variation of this routine 1-2 times daily to ensure that you\u2019re on the right track towards improving your restricted areas. This routine is very customizable and can serve as a foundational stretch, so feel free to add some of your favorite stretches to make this your own!\n\n\nHELP US GROW THIS CHANNEL TO 1000 SUBSCRIBERS!\n\n\nFollow Us On Instagram:\n\n\nJuice @JuicetonTx\n\nToya: @toyaCherrelle \n\nBusiness: @OneBodyLA",
