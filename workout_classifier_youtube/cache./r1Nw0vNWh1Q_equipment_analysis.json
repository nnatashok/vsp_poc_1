  "requiredEquipmentExplanation": "The workout video is titled \"Quick & INTENSE 10-minute Cycling Workout,\" and is presented on the \"Kaleigh Cohen Cycling\" channel, clearly indicating that it is a cycling workout. The description consistently refers to this as a ride and mentions RPMs, resistance levels, and positions associated with cycling, which are specific to a stationary exercise bike workout. Comments from viewers also refer to experiences directly tied to using an exercise bike, such as connecting with the bike and discussing resistance levels. All these factors contribute to a high confidence score of 0.9 that an exercise bike is required for this workout."
